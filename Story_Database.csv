Title,Story
The Imp of the Perverse, in the consideration of the faculties and impulses of the prima mobilia of the human soul  the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which  although obviously existing as a radical  primitive  irreducible sentiment  has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the pure arrogance of the reason  we have all overlooked it.
The Imp of the Perverse,we have suffered its existence to escape our senses  solely through want of belief of faith  whether it be faith in revelation  or faith in the kabbala.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea of it has never occurred to us  simply because of its supererogation.
The Imp of the Perverse,we saw no need of the impulse for the propensity.
The Imp of the Perverse,we could not perceive its necessity.
The Imp of the Perverse,we could not understand  that is to say  we could not have understood  had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself  we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity  either temporal or eternal.
The Imp of the Perverse,it cannot be denied that phrenology and  in great measure  all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.
The Imp of the Perverse,the intellectual or logical man  rather than the understanding or observant man  set himself to imagine designs to dictate purposes to god.
The Imp of the Perverse,having thus fathomed  to his satisfaction  the intentions of jehovah  out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the matter of phrenology  for example  we first determined  naturally enough  that it was the design of the deity that man should eat.
The Imp of the Perverse,we then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness  and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man  will i nill i  into eating.
The Imp of the Perverse,secondly  having settled it to be god    s will that man should continue his species  we discovered an organ of amativeness  forthwith.
The Imp of the Perverse,and so with combativeness  with ideality  with causality  with constructiveness  so  in short  with every organ  whether representing a propensity  a moral sentiment  or a faculty of the pure intellect.
The Imp of the Perverse,and in these arrangements of the principia of human action  the spurzheimites  whether right or wrong  in part  or upon the whole  have but followed  in principle  the footsteps of their predecessors  deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man  and upon the ground of the objects of his creator.
The Imp of the Perverse,it would have been wiser  it would have been safer  to classify  if classify we must  upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did  and was always occasionally doing  rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the deity intended him to do.
The Imp of the Perverse,if we cannot comprehend god in his visible works  how then in his inconceivable thoughts  that call the works into being  if we cannot understand him in his objective creatures  how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation   induction  a posteriori  would have brought phrenology to admit  as an innate and primitive principle of human action  a paradoxical something  which we may call perverseness  for want of a more characteristic term.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the sense i intend  it is  in fact  a mobile without motive  a motive not motivirt.
The Imp of the Perverse,through its promptings we act without comprehensible object  or  if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms  we may so far modify the proposition as to say  that through its promptings we act  for the reason that we should not.
The Imp of the Perverse,in theory  no reason can be more unreasonable  but  in fact  there is none more strong.
The Imp of the Perverse,with certain minds  under certain conditions  it becomes absolutely irresistible.
The Imp of the Perverse,i am not more certain that i breathe  than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us  and alone impels us to its prosecution.
The Imp of the Perverse,nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong    s sake  admit of analysis  or resolution into ulterior elements.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is a radical  a primitive impulse elementary.
The Imp of the Perverse,it will be said  i am aware  that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them  our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.
The Imp of the Perverse,but a glance will show the fallacy of this idea.
The Imp of the Perverse,the phrenological combativeness has for its essence  the necessity of self defence.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is our safeguard against injury.
The Imp of the Perverse,its principle regards our well being  and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development.
The Imp of the Perverse,it follows  that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness  but in the case of that something which i term perverseness  the desire to be well is not only not aroused  but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.
The Imp of the Perverse,an appeal to one    s own heart is  after all  the best reply to the sophistry just noticed.
The Imp of the Perverse,no one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul  will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is not more incomprehensible than distinctive.
The Imp of the Perverse,there lives no man who at some period has not been tormented  for example  by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution.
The Imp of the Perverse,the speaker is aware that he displeases  he has every intention to please  he is usually curt  precise  and clear  the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue  it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow  he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses  yet  the thought strikes him  that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered.
The Imp of the Perverse,that single thought is enough.
The Imp of the Perverse,the impulse increases to a wish  the wish to a desire  the desire to an uncontrollable longing  and the longing  to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker  and in defiance of all consequences  is indulged.
The Imp of the Perverse,we have a task before us which must be speedily performed.
The Imp of the Perverse,we know that it will be ruinous to make delay.
The Imp of the Perverse,the most important crisis of our life calls  trumpet tongued  for immediate energy and action.
The Imp of the Perverse,we glow  we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work  with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire.
The Imp of the Perverse,it must  it shall be undertaken to day  and yet we put it off until to morrow  and why  there is no answer  except that we feel perverse  using the word with no comprehension of the principle.
The Imp of the Perverse,to morrow arrives  and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty  but with this very increase of anxiety arrives  also  a nameless  a positively fearful  because unfathomable  craving for delay.
The Imp of the Perverse,this craving gathers strength as the moments fly.
The Imp of the Perverse,the last hour for action is at hand.
The Imp of the Perverse,we tremble with the violence of the conflict within us  of the definite with the indefinite of the substance with the shadow.
The Imp of the Perverse,but  if the contest have proceeded thus far  it is the shadow which prevails  we struggle in vain.
The Imp of the Perverse,the clock strikes  and is the knell of our welfare.
The Imp of the Perverse,at the same time  it is the chanticleer note to the ghost that has so long overawed us.
The Imp of the Perverse,it flies it disappears we are free.
The Imp of the Perverse,the old energy returns.
The Imp of the Perverse,we will labor now.
The Imp of the Perverse,alas  it is too late   we stand upon the brink of a precipice.
The Imp of the Perverse,we peer into the abyss we grow sick and dizzy.
The Imp of the Perverse,our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.
The Imp of the Perverse,unaccountably we remain.
The Imp of the Perverse,by slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling.
The Imp of the Perverse,by gradations  still more imperceptible  this cloud assumes shape  as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the arabian nights.
The Imp of the Perverse,but out of this our cloud upon the precipice    s edge  there grows into palpability  a shape  far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale  and yet it is but a thought  although a fearful one  and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height.
The Imp of the Perverse,and this fall this rushing annihilation for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it.
The Imp of the Perverse,and because our reason violently deters us from the brink  therefore do we the most impetuously approach it.
The Imp of the Perverse,there is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient  as that of him who  shuddering upon the edge of a precipice  thus meditates a plunge.
The Imp of the Perverse,to indulge  for a moment  in any attempt at thought  is to be inevitably lost  for reflection but urges us to forbear  and therefore it is  i say  that we cannot.
The Imp of the Perverse,if there be no friendly arm to check us  or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss  we plunge  and are destroyed.
The Imp of the Perverse,examine these similar actions as we will  we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the perverse.
The Imp of the Perverse,we perpetrate them because we feel that we should not.
The Imp of the Perverse,beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle  and we might  indeed  deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the arch fiend  were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.
The Imp of the Perverse,i have said thus much  that in some measure i may answer your question that i may explain to you why i am here that i may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters  and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.
The Imp of the Perverse,had i not been thus prolix  you might either have misunderstood me altogether  or  with the rabble  have fancied me mad.
The Imp of the Perverse,as it is  you will easily perceive that i am one of the many uncounted victims of the imp of the perverse.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation.
The Imp of the Perverse,for weeks  for months  i pondered upon the means of the murder.
The Imp of the Perverse,i rejected a thousand schemes  because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection.
The Imp of the Perverse,at length  in reading some french memoirs  i found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to madame pilau  through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea struck my fancy at once.
The Imp of the Perverse,i knew my victim    s habit of reading in bed.
The Imp of the Perverse,i knew  too  that his apartment was narrow and ill ventilated.
The Imp of the Perverse,but i need not vex you with impertinent details.
The Imp of the Perverse,i need not describe the easy artifices by which i substituted  in his bed room candle stand  a wax light of my own making for the one which i there found.
The Imp of the Perverse,the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed  and the coroner    s verdict was  death by the visitation of god.
The Imp of the Perverse,having inherited his estate  all went well with me for years.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea of detection never once entered my brain.
The Imp of the Perverse,of the remains of the fatal taper i had myself carefully disposed.
The Imp of the Perverse,i had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict  or even to suspect me of the crime.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as i reflected upon my absolute security.
The Imp of the Perverse,for a very long period of time i was accustomed to revel in this sentiment.
The Imp of the Perverse,it afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin.
The Imp of the Perverse,but there arrived at length an epoch  from which the pleasurable feeling grew  by scarcely perceptible gradations  into a haunting and harassing thought.
The Imp of the Perverse,it harassed because it haunted.
The Imp of the Perverse,i could scarcely get rid of it for an instant.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears  or rather in our memories  of the burthen of some ordinary song  or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.
The Imp of the Perverse,nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good  or the opera air meritorious.
The Imp of the Perverse,in this manner  at last  i would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security  and repeating  in a low undertone  the phrase   i am safe.
The Imp of the Perverse,one day  whilst sauntering along the streets  i arrested myself in the act of murmuring  half aloud  these customary syllables.
The Imp of the Perverse,in a fit of petulance  i remodelled them thus   i am safe i am safe yes if i be not fool enough to make open confession    no sooner had i spoken these words  than i felt an icy chill creep to my heart.
The Imp of the Perverse,i had had some experience in these fits of perversity  whose nature i have been at some trouble to explain   and i remembered well that in no instance i had successfully resisted their attacks.
The Imp of the Perverse,and now my own casual self suggestion that i might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which i had been guilty  confronted me  as if the very ghost of him whom i had murdered and beckoned me on to death.
The Imp of the Perverse,at first  i made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.
The Imp of the Perverse,i walked vigorously faster still faster at length i ran.
The Imp of the Perverse,i felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.
The Imp of the Perverse,every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror  for  alas  i well  too well understood that to think  in my situation  was to be lost.
The Imp of the Perverse,i still quickened my pace.
The Imp of the Perverse,i bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.
The Imp of the Perverse,at length  the populace took the alarm  and pursued me.
The Imp of the Perverse,i felt then the consummation of my fate.
The Imp of the Perverse,could i have torn out my tongue  i would have done it  but a rough voice resounded in my ears a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder.
The Imp of the Perverse,i turned i gasped for breath.
The Imp of the Perverse,for a moment i experienced all the pangs of suffocation  i became blind  and deaf  and giddy  and then some invisible fiend  i thought  struck me with his broad palm upon the back.
The Imp of the Perverse,the long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.
The Imp of the Perverse,they say that i spoke with a distinct enunciation  but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry  as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.
The Imp of the Perverse,having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction  i fell prostrate in a swoon.
The Imp of the Perverse,but why shall i say more  to day i wear these chains  and am here  to morrow i shall be fetterless  but where
The Purloined Letter, at paris  just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of      i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum  in company with my friend c. auguste dupin  in his little back library  or book closet  au troisi  me  no.
The Purloined Letter,rue dun  t  faubourg st. germain.
The Purloined Letter,for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence  while each  to any casual observer  might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.
The Purloined Letter,for myself  however  i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening  i mean the affair of the rue morgue  and the mystery attending the murder of marie rog  t. i looked upon it  therefore  as something of a coincidence  when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance  monsieur g    the prefect of the parisian police.
The Purloined Letter,we gave him a hearty welcome  for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man  and we had not seen him for several years.
The Purloined Letter,we had been sitting in the dark  and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp  but sat down again  without doing so  upon g.    s saying that he had called to consult us  or rather to ask the opinion of my friend  about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.
The Purloined Letter,if it is any point requiring reflection   observed dupin  as he forebore to enkindle the wick   we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.
The Purloined Letter,that is another of your odd notions   said the prefect  who had a fashion of calling every thing  odd  that was beyond his comprehension  and thus lived amid an absolute legion of  oddities.
The Purloined Letter,very true   said dupin  as he supplied his visitor with a pipe  and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.
The Purloined Letter,and what is the difficulty now   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,nothing more in the assassination way  i hope     oh no  nothing of that nature.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  the business is very simple indeed  and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves  but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it  because it is so excessively odd.
The Purloined Letter,simple and odd   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,why  yes  and not exactly that  either.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple  and yet baffles us altogether.
The Purloined Letter,perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault   said my friend.
The Purloined Letter,what nonsense you do talk   replied the prefect  laughing heartily.
The Purloined Letter,perhaps the mystery is a little too plain   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,oh  good heavens  who ever heard of such an idea     a little too self evident.
The Purloined Letter,ha  ha  ha ha  ha  ha  ho  ho  ho   roared our visitor  profoundly amused   oh  dupin  you will be the death of me yet     and what  after all  is the matter on hand   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,why  i will tell you   replied the prefect  as he gave a long  steady and contemplative puff  and settled himself in his chair.
The Purloined Letter,i will tell you in a few words  but  before i begin  let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy  and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold  were it known that i confided it to any one.
The Purloined Letter,proceed   said i.
The Purloined Letter,or not   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,well  then  i have received personal information  from a very high quarter  that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments.
The Purloined Letter,the individual who purloined it is known  this beyond a doubt  he was seen to take it.
The Purloined Letter,it is known  also  that it still remains in his possession.
The Purloined Letter,how is this known   asked dupin.
The Purloined Letter,it is clearly inferred   replied the prefect   from the nature of the document  and from the non appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber    s possession  that is to say  from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.
The Purloined Letter,be a little more explicit   i said.
The Purloined Letter,well  i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.
The Purloined Letter,the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
The Purloined Letter,still i do not quite understand   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,no  well  the disclosure of the document to a third person  who shall be nameless  would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station  and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.
The Purloined Letter,but this ascendancy   i interposed   would depend upon the robber    s knowledge of the loser    s knowledge of the robber.
The Purloined Letter,who would dare     the thief   said g.   is the minister d    who dares all things  those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.
The Purloined Letter,the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.
The Purloined Letter,the document in question a letter  to be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.
The Purloined Letter,during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.
The Purloined Letter,after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer  she was forced to place it  open as it was  upon a table.
The Purloined Letter,the address  however  was uppermost  and  the contents thus unexposed  the letter escaped notice.
The Purloined Letter,at this juncture enters the minister d  .
The Purloined Letter,his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper  recognises the handwriting of the address  observes the confusion of the personage addressed  and fathoms her secret.
The Purloined Letter,after some business transactions  hurried through in his ordinary manner  he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question  opens it  pretends to read it  and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.
The Purloined Letter,again he converses  for some fifteen minutes  upon the public affairs.
The Purloined Letter,at length  in taking leave  he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.
The Purloined Letter,its rightful owner saw  but  of course  dared not call attention to the act  in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.
The Purloined Letter,the minister decamped  leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table.
The Purloined Letter,here  then   said dupin to me   you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete the robber    s knowledge of the loser    s knowledge of the robber.
The Purloined Letter,yes   replied the prefect   and the power thus attained has  for some months past  been wielded  for political purposes  to a very dangerous extent.
The Purloined Letter,the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced  every day  of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.
The Purloined Letter,but this  of course  cannot be done openly.
The Purloined Letter,in fine  driven to despair  she has committed the matter to me.
The Purloined Letter,than whom   said dupin  amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke   no more sagacious agent could  i suppose  be desired  or even imagined.
The Purloined Letter,you flatter me   replied the prefect   but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.
The Purloined Letter,it is clear   said i   as you observe  that the letter is still in possession of the minister  since it is this possession  and not any employment of the letter  which bestows the power.
The Purloined Letter,with the employment the power departs.
The Purloined Letter,true   said g.   and upon this conviction i proceeded.
The Purloined Letter,my first care was to make thorough search of the minister    s hotel  and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
The Purloined Letter,beyond all things  i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.
The Purloined Letter,but   said i   you are quite au fait in these investigations.
The Purloined Letter,the parisian police have done this thing often before.
The Purloined Letter,oh  yes  and for this reason i did not despair.
The Purloined Letter,the habits of the minister gave me  too  a great advantage.
The Purloined Letter,he is frequently absent from home all night.
The Purloined Letter,his servants are by no means numerous.
The Purloined Letter,they sleep at a distance from their master    s apartment  and  being chiefly neapolitans  are readily made drunk.
The Purloined Letter,i have keys  as you know  with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris.
The Purloined Letter,for three months a night has not passed  during the greater part of which i have not been engaged  personally  in ransacking the d   hotel.
The Purloined Letter,my honor is interested  and  to mention a great secret  the reward is enormous.
The Purloined Letter,so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.
The Purloined Letter,i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.
The Purloined Letter,but is it not possible   i suggested   that although the letter may be in possession of the minister  as it unquestionably is  he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises     this is barely possible   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the present peculiar condition of affairs at court  and especially of those intrigues in which d   is known to be involved  would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moment    s notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.
The Purloined Letter,its susceptibility of being produced   said i.
The Purloined Letter,that is to say  of being destroyed   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,true   i observed   the paper is clearly then upon the premises.
The Purloined Letter,as for its being upon the person of the minister  we may consider that as out of the question.
The Purloined Letter,entirely   said the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,he has been twice waylaid  as if by footpads  and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.
The Purloined Letter,you might have spared yourself this trouble   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,d    i presume  is not altogether a fool  and  if not  must have anticipated these waylayings  as a matter of course.
The Purloined Letter,not altogether a fool   said g.   but then he    s a poet  which i take to be only one remove from a fool.
The Purloined Letter,true   said dupin  after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum   although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.
The Purloined Letter,suppose you detail   said i   the particulars of your search.
The Purloined Letter,why the fact is  we took our time  and we searched everywhere.
The Purloined Letter,i have had long experience in these affairs.
The Purloined Letter,i took the entire building  room by room  devoting the nights of a whole week to each.
The Purloined Letter,we examined  first  the furniture of each apartment.
The Purloined Letter,we opened every possible drawer  and i presume you know that  to a properly trained police agent  such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible.
The Purloined Letter,any man is a dolt who permits a     secret     drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.
The Purloined Letter,the thing is so plain.
The Purloined Letter,there is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet.
The Purloined Letter,then we have accurate rules.
The Purloined Letter,the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.
The Purloined Letter,after the cabinets we took the chairs.
The Purloined Letter,the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.
The Purloined Letter,from the tables we removed the tops.
The Purloined Letter,why so     sometimes the top of a table  or other similarly arranged piece of furniture  is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article  then the leg is excavated  the article deposited within the cavity  and the top replaced.
The Purloined Letter,the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.
The Purloined Letter,but could not the cavity be detected by sounding   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,by no means  if  when the article is deposited  a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it.
The Purloined Letter,besides  in our case  we were obliged to proceed without noise.
The Purloined Letter,but you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention.
The Purloined Letter,a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll  not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting needle  and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair  for example.
The Purloined Letter,you did not take to pieces all the chairs     certainly not  but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel  and  indeed the jointings of every description of furniture  by the aid of a most powerful microscope.
The Purloined Letter,had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.
The Purloined Letter,a single grain of gimlet dust  for example  would have been as obvious as an apple.
The Purloined Letter,any disorder in the glueing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection.
The Purloined Letter,i presume you looked to the mirrors  between the boards and the plates  and you probed the beds and the bed clothes  as well as the curtains and carpets.
The Purloined Letter,that of course  and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way  then we examined the house itself.
The Purloined Letter,we divided its entire surface into compartments  which we numbered  so that none might be missed  then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises  including the two houses immediately adjoining  with the microscope  as before.
The Purloined Letter,the two houses adjoining   i exclaimed   you must have had a great deal of trouble.
The Purloined Letter,we had  but the reward offered is prodigious     you include the grounds about the houses     all the grounds are paved with brick.
The Purloined Letter,they gave us comparatively little trouble.
The Purloined Letter,we examined the moss between the bricks  and found it undisturbed.
The Purloined Letter,you looked among d      s papers  of course  and into the books of the library     certainly  we opened every package and parcel  we not only opened every book  but we turned over every leaf in each volume  not contenting ourselves with a mere shake  according to the fashion of some of our police officers.
The Purloined Letter,we also measured the thickness of every book cover  with the most accurate admeasurement  and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.
The Purloined Letter,had any of the bindings been recently meddled with  it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.
The Purloined Letter,some five or six volumes  just from the hands of the binder  we carefully probed  longitudinally  with the needles.
The Purloined Letter,you explored the floors beneath the carpets     beyond doubt.
The Purloined Letter,we removed every carpet  and examined the boards with the microscope.
The Purloined Letter,and the paper on the walls     yes.
The Purloined Letter,you looked into the cellars     we did.
The Purloined Letter,then   i said   you have been making a miscalculation  and the letter is not upon the premises  as you suppose.
The Purloined Letter,i fear you are right there   said the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,and now  dupin  what would you advise me to do     to make a thorough re search of the premises.
The Purloined Letter,that is absolutely needless   replied g  .
The Purloined Letter,i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel.
The Purloined Letter,i have no better advice to give you   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,you have  of course  an accurate description of the letter     oh yes   and here the prefect  producing a memorandum book  proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal  and especially of the external appearance of the missing document.
The Purloined Letter,soon after finishing the perusal of this description  he took his departure  more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before.
The Purloined Letter,in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit  and found us occupied very nearly as before.
The Purloined Letter,he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation.
The Purloined Letter,at length i said     well  but g    what of the purloined letter  i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister     confound him  say i yes  i made the re examination  however  as dupin suggested but it was all labor lost  as i knew it would be.
The Purloined Letter,how much was the reward offered  did you say   asked dupin.
The Purloined Letter,why  a very great deal a very liberal reward i don    t like to say how much  precisely  but one thing i will say  that i wouldn    t mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  it is becoming of more and more importance every day  and the reward has been lately doubled.
The Purloined Letter,if it were trebled  however  i could do no more than i have done.
The Purloined Letter,why  yes   said dupin  drawlingly  between the whiffs of his meerschaum   i really think  g    you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter.
The Purloined Letter,you might do a little more  i think  eh     how  in what way     why puff  puff you might puff  puff employ counsel in the matter  eh  puff  puff  puff.
The Purloined Letter,do you remember the story they tell of abernethy     no  hang abernethy     to be sure  hang him and welcome.
The Purloined Letter,but  once upon a time  a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion.
The Purloined Letter,getting up  for this purpose  an ordinary conversation in a private company  he insinuated his case to the physician  as that of an imaginary individual.
The Purloined Letter,we will suppose      said the miser      that his symptoms are such and such  now  doctor  what would you have directed him to take            take      said abernethy      why  take advice  to be sure.
The Purloined Letter,but   said the prefect  a little discomposed   i am perfectly willing to take advice  and to pay for it.
The Purloined Letter,i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.
The Purloined Letter,in that case   replied dupin  opening a drawer  and producing a check book   you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.
The Purloined Letter,when you have signed it  i will hand you the letter.
The Purloined Letter,i was astounded.
The Purloined Letter,the prefect appeared absolutely thunder stricken.
The Purloined Letter,for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless  looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth  and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets  then  apparently recovering himself in some measure  he seized a pen  and after several pauses and vacant stares  finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs  and handed it across the table to dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket book  then  unlocking an escritoire  took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,this functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy  opened it with a trembling hand  cast a rapid glance at its contents  and then  scrambling and struggling to the door  rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house  without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check.
The Purloined Letter,when he had gone  my friend entered into some explanations.
The Purloined Letter,the parisian police   he said   are exceedingly able in their way.
The Purloined Letter,they are persevering  ingenious  cunning  and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand.
The Purloined Letter,thus  when g   detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d    i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation so far as his labors extended.
The Purloined Letter,so far as his labors extended   said i.
The Purloined Letter,yes   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind  but carried out to absolute perfection.
The Purloined Letter,had the letter been deposited within the range of their search  these fellows would  beyond a question  have found it.
The Purloined Letter,i merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.
The Purloined Letter,the measures  then   he continued   were good in their kind  and well executed  their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case  and to the man.
The Purloined Letter,a certain set of highly ingenious resources are  with the prefect  a sort of procrustean bed  to which he forcibly adapts his designs.
The Purloined Letter,but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand  and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.
The Purloined Letter,i knew one about eight years of age  whose success at guessing in the game of     even and odd     attracted universal admiration.
The Purloined Letter,this game is simple  and is played with marbles.
The Purloined Letter,one player holds in his hand a number of these toys  and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.
The Purloined Letter,if the guess is right  the guesser wins one  if wrong  he loses one.
The Purloined Letter,the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school.
The Purloined Letter,of course he had some principle of guessing  and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents.
The Purloined Letter,for example  an arrant simpleton is his opponent  and  holding up his closed hand  asks      are they even or odd      our schoolboy replies      odd      and loses  but upon the second trial he wins  for he then says to himself      the simpleton had them even upon the first trial  and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second  i will therefore guess odd      he guesses odd  and wins.
The Purloined Letter,now  with a simpleton a degree above the first  he would have reasoned thus      this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd  and  in the second  he will propose to himself  upon the first impulse  a simple variation from even to odd  as did the first simpleton  but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation  and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before.
The Purloined Letter,i will therefore guess even      he guesses even  and wins.
The Purloined Letter,now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy  whom his fellows termed     lucky      what  in its last analysis  is it     it is merely   i said   an identification of the reasoner    s intellect with that of his opponent.
The Purloined Letter,it is   said dupin   and  upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted  i received answer as follows      when i wish to find out how wise  or how stupid  or how good  or how wicked is any one  or what are his thoughts at the moment  i fashion the expression of my face  as accurately as possible  in accordance with the expression of his  and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart  as if to match or correspond with the expression.
The Purloined Letter,this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucault  to la bougive  to machiavelli  and to campanella.
The Purloined Letter,and the identification   i said   of the reasoner    s intellect with that of his opponent  depends  if i understand you aright  upon the accuracy with which the opponent    s intellect is admeasured.
The Purloined Letter,for its practical value it depends upon this   replied dupin   and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently  first  by default of this identification  and  secondly  by ill admeasurement  or rather through non admeasurement  of the intellect with which they are engaged.
The Purloined Letter,they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity  and  in searching for anything hidden  advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it.
The Purloined Letter,they are right in this much that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass  but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own  the felon foils them  of course.
The Purloined Letter,this always happens when it is above their own  and very usually when it is below.
The Purloined Letter,they have no variation of principle in their investigations  at best  when urged by some unusual emergency by some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice  without touching their principles.
The Purloined Letter,what  for example  in this case of d    has been done to vary the principle of action  what is all this boring  and probing  and sounding  and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search  which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity  to which the prefect  in the long routine of his duty  has been accustomed  do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter  not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg but  at least  in some out of the way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg  and do you not see also  that such recherch  s nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions  and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects  for  in all cases of concealment  a disposal of the article concealed a disposal of it in this recherch   manner  is  in the very first instance  presumable and presumed  and thus its discovery depends  not at all upon the acumen  but altogether upon the mere care  patience  and determination of the seekers  and where the case is of importance or  what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes  when the reward is of magnitude  the qualities in question have never been known to fail.
The Purloined Letter,you will now understand what i meant in suggesting that  had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefect    s examination in other words  had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.
The Purloined Letter,this functionary  however  has been thoroughly mystified  and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool  because he has acquired renown as a poet.
The Purloined Letter,all fools are poets  this the prefect feels  and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.
The Purloined Letter,but is this really the poet   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,there are two brothers  i know  and both have attained reputation in letters.
The Purloined Letter,the minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus.
The Purloined Letter,he is a mathematician  and no poet.
The Purloined Letter,you are mistaken  i know him well  he is both.
The Purloined Letter,as poet and mathematician  he would reason well  as mere mathematician  he could not have reasoned at all  and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,you surprise me   i said   by these opinions  which have been contradicted by the voice of the world.
The Purloined Letter,you do not mean to set at naught the well digested idea of centuries.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.
The Purloined Letter,il y a    pari  r       replied dupin  quoting from chamfort       que toute id  e publique  toute convention re  ue est une sottise  car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematicians  i grant you  have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude  and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth.
The Purloined Letter,with an art worthy a better cause  for example  they have insinuated the term     analysis     into application to algebra.
The Purloined Letter,the french are the originators of this particular deception  but if a term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then     analysis     conveys     algebra     about as much as  in latin      ambitus     implies     ambition          religio         religion      or     homines honesti     a set of honorable men.
The Purloined Letter,you have a quarrel on hand  i see   said i   with some of the algebraists of paris  but proceed.
The Purloined Letter,i dispute the availability  and thus the value  of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.
The Purloined Letter,i dispute  in particular  the reason educed by mathematical study.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematics are the science of form and quantity  mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity.
The Purloined Letter,the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra  are abstract or general truths.
The Purloined Letter,and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.
The Purloined Letter,mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.
The Purloined Letter,what is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals  for example.
The Purloined Letter,in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole.
The Purloined Letter,in chemistry also the axiom fails.
The Purloined Letter,in the consideration of motive it fails  for two motives  each of a given value  have not  necessarily  a value when united  equal to the sum of their values apart.
The Purloined Letter,there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation.
The Purloined Letter,but the mathematician argues  from his finite truths  through habit  as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be.
The Purloined Letter,bryant  in his very learned     mythology      mentions an analogous source of error  when he says that     although the pagan fables are not believed  yet we forget ourselves continually  and make inferences from them as existing realities.
The Purloined Letter,with the algebraists  however  who are pagans themselves  the     pagan fables     are believed  and the inferences are made  not so much through lapse of memory  as through an unaccountable addling of the brains.
The Purloined Letter,in short  i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots  or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x  px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q.
The Purloined Letter,say to one of these gentlemen  by way of experiment  if you please  that you believe occasions may occur where x  px is not altogether equal to q  and  having made him understand what you mean  get out of his reach as speedily as convenient  for  beyond doubt  he will endeavor to knock you down.
The Purloined Letter,i mean to say   continued dupin  while i merely laughed at his last observations   that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician  the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check.
The Purloined Letter,i know him  however  as both mathematician and poet  and my measures were adapted to his capacity  with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded.
The Purloined Letter,i knew him as a courtier  too  and as a bold intriguant.
The Purloined Letter,such a man  i considered  could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action.
The Purloined Letter,he could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected.
The Purloined Letter,he must have foreseen  i reflected  the secret investigations of his premises.
The Purloined Letter,his frequent absences from home at night  which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success  i regarded only as ruses  to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police  and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g    in fact  did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises.
The Purloined Letter,i felt  also  that the whole train of thought  which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now  concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister.
The Purloined Letter,it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment.
The Purloined Letter,he could not  i reflected  be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes  to the probes  to the gimlets  and to the microscopes of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,i saw  in fine  that he would be driven  as a matter of course  to simplicity  if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.
The Purloined Letter,you will remember  perhaps  how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested  upon our first interview  that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self evident.
The Purloined Letter,yes   said i   i remember his merriment well.
The Purloined Letter,i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.
The Purloined Letter,the material world   continued dupin   abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial  and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma  that metaphor  or simile  may be made to strengthen an argument  as well as to embellish a description.
The Purloined Letter,the principle of the vis inerti    for example  seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.
The Purloined Letter,it is not more true in the former  that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one  and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty  than it is  in the latter  that intellects of the vaster capacity  while more forcible  more constant  and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade  are yet the less readily moved  and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.
The Purloined Letter,again  have you ever noticed which of the street signs  over the shop doors  are the most attractive of attention     i have never given the matter a thought   i said.
The Purloined Letter,there is a game of puzzles   he resumed   which is played upon a map.
The Purloined Letter,one party playing requires another to find a given word the name of town  river  state or empire any word  in short  upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.
The Purloined Letter,a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names  but the adept selects such words as stretch  in large characters  from one end of the chart to the other.
The Purloined Letter,these  like the over largely lettered signs and placards of the street  escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious  and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self evident.
The Purloined Letter,but this is a point  it appears  somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,he never once thought it probable  or possible  that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world  by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.
The Purloined Letter,but the more i reflected upon the daring  dashing  and discriminating ingenuity of d    upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand  if he intended to use it to good purpose  and upon the decisive evidence  obtained by the prefect  that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary    s ordinary search the more satisfied i became that  to conceal this letter  the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.
The Purloined Letter,full of these ideas  i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles  and called one fine morning  quite by accident  at the ministerial hotel.
The Purloined Letter,i found d   at home  yawning  lounging  and dawdling  as usual  and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui.
The Purloined Letter,he is  perhaps  the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when nobody sees him.
The Purloined Letter,to be even with him  i complained of my weak eyes  and lamented the necessity of the spectacles  under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment  while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.
The Purloined Letter,i paid especial attention to a large writing table near which he sat  and upon which lay confusedly  some miscellaneous letters and other papers  with one or two musical instruments and a few books.
The Purloined Letter,here  however  after a long and very deliberate scrutiny  i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.
The Purloined Letter,at length my eyes  in going the circuit of the room  fell upon a trumpery fillagree card rack of pasteboard  that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon  from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel piece.
The Purloined Letter,in this rack  which had three or four compartments  were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter.
The Purloined Letter,this last was much soiled and crumpled.
The Purloined Letter,it was torn nearly in two  across the middle as if a design  in the first instance  to tear it entirely up as worthless  had been altered  or stayed  in the second.
The Purloined Letter,it had a large black seal  bearing the d   cipher very conspicuously  and was addressed  in a diminutive female hand  to d    the minister  himself.
The Purloined Letter,it was thrust carelessly  and even  as it seemed  contemptuously  into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.
The Purloined Letter,no sooner had i glanced at this letter  than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search.
The Purloined Letter,to be sure  it was  to all appearance  radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description.
The Purloined Letter,here the seal was large and black  with the d   cipher  there it was small and red  with the ducal arms of the s   family.
The Purloined Letter,here  the address  to the minister  diminutive and feminine  there the superscription  to a certain royal personage  was markedly bold and decided  the size alone formed a point of correspondence.
The Purloined Letter,but  then  the radicalness of these differences  which was excessive  the dirt  the soiled and torn condition of the paper  so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d    and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things  together with the hyper obtrusive situation of this document  full in the view of every visitor  and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived  these things  i say  were strongly corroborative of suspicion  in one who came with the intention to suspect.
The Purloined Letter,i protracted my visit as long as possible  and  while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him  i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter.
The Purloined Letter,in this examination  i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack  and also fell  at length  upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained.
The Purloined Letter,in scrutinizing the edges of the paper  i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary.
The Purloined Letter,they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper  having been once folded and pressed with a folder  is refolded in a reversed direction  in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold.
The Purloined Letter,this discovery was sufficient.
The Purloined Letter,it was clear to me that the letter had been turned  as a glove  inside out  re directed  and re sealed.
The Purloined Letter,i bade the minister good morning  and took my departure at once  leaving a gold snuff box upon the table.
The Purloined Letter,the next morning i called for the snuff box  when we resumed  quite eagerly  the conversation of the preceding day.
The Purloined Letter,while thus engaged  however  a loud report  as if of a pistol  was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel  and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams  and the shoutings of a terrified mob.
The Purloined Letter,d   rushed to a casement  threw it open  and looked out.
The Purloined Letter,in the meantime  i stepped to the card rack  took the letter  put it in my pocket  and replaced it by a fac simile   so far as regards externals   which i had carefully prepared at my lodgings imitating the d   cipher  very readily  by means of a seal formed of bread.
The Purloined Letter,the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket.
The Purloined Letter,he had fired it among a crowd of women and children.
The Purloined Letter,it proved  however  to have been without ball  and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard.
The Purloined Letter,when he had gone  d   came from the window  whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.
The Purloined Letter,soon afterwards i bade him farewell.
The Purloined Letter,the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.
The Purloined Letter,but what purpose had you   i asked   in replacing the letter by a fac simile  would it not have been better  at the first visit  to have seized it openly  and departed     d     replied dupin   is a desperate man  and a man of nerve.
The Purloined Letter,his hotel  too  is not without attendants devoted to his interests.
The Purloined Letter,had i made the wild attempt you suggest  i might never have left the ministerial presence alive.
The Purloined Letter,the good people of paris might have heard of me no more.
The Purloined Letter,but i had an object apart from these considerations.
The Purloined Letter,you know my political prepossessions.
The Purloined Letter,in this matter  i act as a partisan of the lady concerned.
The Purloined Letter,for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power.
The Purloined Letter,she has now him in hers since  being unaware that the letter is not in his possession  he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.
The Purloined Letter,thus will he inevitably commit himself  at once  to his political destruction.
The Purloined Letter,his downfall  too  will not be more precipitate than awkward.
The Purloined Letter,it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni  but in all kinds of climbing  as catalani said of singing  it is far more easy to get up than to come down.
The Purloined Letter,in the present instance i have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends.
The Purloined Letter,he is that monstrum horrendum  an unprincipled man of genius.
The Purloined Letter,i confess  however  that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts  when  being defied by her whom the prefect terms     a certain personage     he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the card rack.
The Purloined Letter,how  did you put any thing particular in it     why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting.
The Purloined Letter,d    at vienna once  did me an evil turn  which i told him  quite good humoredly  that i should remember.
The Purloined Letter,so  as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him  i thought it a pity not to give him a clue.
The Purloined Letter,he is well acquainted with my ms.  and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade, having had occasion  lately  in the course of some oriental investigations  to consult the tellmenow isits  ornot  a work which  like the zohar of simeon jochaides  is scarcely known at all  even in europe  and which has never been quoted  to my knowledge  by any american if we except  perhaps  the author of the  curiosities of american literature   having had occasion  i say  to turn over some pages of the first mentioned very remarkable work  i was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier    s daughter  scheherazade  as that fate is depicted in the  arabian nights   and that the d  nouement there given  if not altogether inaccurate  as far as it goes  is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,for full information on this interesting topic  i must refer the inquisitive reader to the  isits  ornot  itself  but in the meantime  i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it will be remembered  that  in the usual version of the tales  a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen  not only puts her to death  but makes a vow  by his beard and the prophet  to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions  and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter  and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense  he was interrupted one afternoon  no doubt at his prayers  by a visit from his grand vizier  to whose daughter  it appears  there had occurred an idea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,her name was scheherazade  and her idea was  that she would either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty  or perish  after the approved fashion of all heroines  in the attempt.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,accordingly  and although we do not find it to be leap year  which makes the sacrifice more meritorious   she deputes her father  the grand vizier  to make an offer to the king of her hand.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this hand the king eagerly accepts  he had intended to take it at all events  and had put off the matter from day to day  only through fear of the vizier   but  in accepting it now  he gives all parties very distinctly to understand  that  grand vizier or no grand vizier  he has not the slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when  therefore  the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king  and did actually marry him despite her father    s excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind when she would and did marry him  i say  will i  nill i  it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it seems  however  that this politic damsel  who had been reading machiavelli  beyond doubt   had a very ingenious little plot in her mind.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,on the night of the wedding  she contrived  upon i forget what specious pretence  to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed  and  a little before cock crowing  she took care to awaken the good monarch  her husband  who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow   she managed to awaken him  i say   although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion  he slept well  by the profound interest of a story  about a rat and a black cat  i think  which she was narrating  all in an undertone  of course  to her sister.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the day broke  it so happened that this history was not altogether finished  and that scheherazade  in the nature of things could not finish it just then  since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung a thing very little more pleasant than hanging  only a trifle more genteel   the king    s curiosity  however  prevailing  i am sorry to say  even over his sound religious principles  induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning  for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat  a black cat  i think it was  and the rat.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the night having arrived  however  the lady scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat  the rat was blue  but before she well knew what she was about  found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration  having reference  if i am not altogether mistaken  to a pink horse  with green wings  that went  in a violent manner  by clockwork  and was wound up with an indigo key.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other and  as the day broke before its conclusion  notwithstanding all the queen    s endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing   there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before  for twenty four hours.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result  and then the next and then again the next  so that  in the end  the good monarch  having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights  either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time  or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way  or  what is more probable  breaks it outright  as well as the head of his father confessor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at all events  scheherazade  who  being lineally descended from eve  fell heir  perhaps  to the whole seven baskets of talk  which the latter lady  we all know  picked up from under the trees in the garden of eden  scheherazade  i say  finally triumphed  and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,now  this conclusion  which is that of the story as we have it upon record  is  no doubt  excessively proper and pleasant but alas  like a great many pleasant things  is more pleasant than true  and i am indebted altogether to the  isits  ornot  for the means of correcting the error.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,le mieux   says a french proverb   est l    ennemi du bien   and  in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk  i should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to seventy seven.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,my dear sister   said she  on the thousand and second night   i quote the language of the  isits  ornot  at this point  verbatim   my dear sister   said she   now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has blown over  and that this odious tax is so happily repealed  i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king  who i am sorry to say  snores a thing no gentleman would do  the full conclusion of sinbad the sailor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which i related  but the truth is  i felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration  and so was seduced into cutting them short a grievous piece of misconduct  for which i only trust that allah will forgive me.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect and as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise  i will forthwith entertain you  and him if he pleases  with the sequel of this very remarkable story.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hereupon the sister of scheherazade  as i have it from the  isits  ornot   expressed no very particular intensity of gratification  but the king  having been sufficiently pinched  at length ceased snoring  and finally said   hum   and then  hoo   when the queen  understanding these words  which are no doubt arabic  to signify that he was all attention  and would do his best not to snore any more the queen  i say  having arranged these matters to her satisfaction  re entered thus  at once  into the history of sinbad the sailor        at length  in my old age       these are the words of sinbad himself  as retailed by scheherazade      at length  in my old age  and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home  i became once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries  and one day  without acquainting any of my family with my design  i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky  and  engaging a porter to carry them  went with him down to the sea shore  to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explored.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having deposited the packages upon the sands  we sat down beneath some trees  and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship  but during several hours we saw none whatever.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound  and the porter  after listening awhile  declared that he also could distinguish it.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,presently it grew louder  and then still louder  so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at length  on the edge of the horizon  we discovered a black speck  which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster  swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it came toward us with inconceivable swiftness  throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast  and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed  with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow  and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace  o most sublime and munificent of the caliphs.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its body  which was unlike that of ordinary fishes  was as solid as a rock  and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water  with the exception of a narrow blood red streak that completely begirdled it.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the belly  which floated beneath the surface  and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows  was entirely covered with metallic scales  of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the back was flat and nearly white  and from it there extended upwards of six spines  about half the length of the whole body.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive  but  as if to make up for this deficiency  it was provided with at least four score of eyes  that protruded from their sockets like those of the green dragon fly  and were arranged all around the body in two rows  one above the other  and parallel to the blood red streak  which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others  and had the appearance of solid gold.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,although this beast approached us  as i have before said  with the greatest rapidity  it must have been moved altogether by necromancy for it had neither fins like a fish nor web feet like a duck  nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel  nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike  only  not far from the latter  were two small holes that served for nostrils  and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence  and with a shrieking  disagreeable noise.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great  but it was even surpassed by our astonishment  when upon getting a nearer look  we perceived upon the creature    s back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men  and altogether much resembling them  except that they wore no garments  as men do   being supplied  by nature  no doubt  with an ugly uncomfortable covering  a good deal like cloth  but fitting so tight to the skin  as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward  and put them apparently to severe pain.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,on the very tips of their heads were certain square looking boxes  which  at first sight  i thought might have been intended to answer as turbans  but i soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid  and i therefore concluded they were contrivances designed  by their great weight  to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars   badges of servitude  no doubt   such as we keep on our dogs  only much wider and infinitely stiffer  so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time  and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful  if not positively in an awful degree.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood  it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent  and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire  accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke  and a noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,as the smoke cleared away  we saw one of the odd man animals standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand  through which  putting it to his mouth  he presently addressed us in loud  harsh  and disagreeable accents  that  perhaps  we should have mistaken for language  had they not come altogether through the nose.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,being thus evidently spoken to  i was at a loss how to reply  as i could in no manner understand what was said  and in this difficulty i turned to the porter  who was near swooning through affright  and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was  what it wanted  and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,to this the porter replied  as well as he could for trepidation  that he had once before heard of this sea beast  that it was a cruel demon  with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire  created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind  that the things upon its back were vermin  such as sometimes infest cats and dogs  only a little larger and more savage  and that these vermin had their uses  however evil for  through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings  it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill  and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this account determined me to take to my heels  and  without once even looking behind me  i ran at full speed up into the hills  while the porter ran equally fast  although nearly in an opposite direction  so that  by these means  he finally made his escape with my bundles  of which i have no doubt he took excellent care although this is a point i cannot determine  as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,for myself  i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men vermin  who had come to the shore in boats  that i was very soon overtaken  bound hand and foot  and conveyed to the beast  which immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this  but regret being useless  i made the best of my condition  and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the man animal that owned the trumpet  and who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i succeeded so well in this endeavor that  in a few days  the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor  and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language  so that  at length  i was enabled to converse with it readily  and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,washish squashish squeak  sinbad  hey diddle diddle  grunt unt grumble  hiss  fiss  whiss      said he to me  one day after dinner but i beg a thousand pardons  i had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the cock neighs  so the man animals were called  i presume because their language formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of the rooster .
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,with your permission  i will translate.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,washish squashish      and so forth  that is to say      i am happy to find  my dear sinbad  that you are really a very excellent fellow  we are now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the globe  and since you are so desirous of seeing the world  i will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the beast.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far  relates the  isits  ornot   the king turned over from his left side to his right  and said    it is  in fact  very surprising  my dear queen  that you omitted  hitherto  these latter adventures of sinbad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange    the king having thus expressed himself  we are told  the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the following words    sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative     i thanked the man animal for its kindness  and soon found myself very much at home on the beast  which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean  although the surface of the latter is  in that part of the world  by no means flat  but round like a pomegranate  so that we went so to say either up hill or down hill all the time.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,that i think  was very singular   interrupted the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,nevertheless  it is quite true   replied scheherazade.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i have my doubts   rejoined the king   but  pray  be so good as to go on with the story.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i will   said the queen.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the beast      continued sinbad to the caliph      swam  as i have related  up hill and down hill until  at length  we arrived at an island  many hundreds of miles in circumference  but which  nevertheless  had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,leaving this island      said sinbad  for scheherazade  it must be understood  took no notice of her husband    s ill mannered ejaculation      leaving this island  we came to another where the forests were of solid stone  and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king  again  but scheherazade  paying him no attention  continued in the language of sinbad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,passing beyond this last island  we reached a country where there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth  and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,from the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads of gems  like diamonds  but larger than men  and in among the streets of towers and pyramids and temples  there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony  and swarming with fish that had no eyes.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty mountain  down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal  some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long       while from an abyss on the summit  issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens  and it became darker than the darkest midnight  so that when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain  it was impossible to see the whitest object  however close we held it to our eyes.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,after quitting this coast  the beast continued his voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed for we here saw a great lake  at the bottom of which  more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water  there flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hoo   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel  just as our own does feather.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,fiddle de dee   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,proceeding still in the same direction  we presently arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole world.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,through it there meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this river was of unspeakable depth  and of a transparency richer than that of amber.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it was from three to six miles in width  and its banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height  were crowned with ever blossoming trees and perpetual sweet scented flowers  that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden  but the name of this luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror  and to enter it was inevitable death.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,humph   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we left this kingdom in great haste  and  after some days  came to another  where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil  of a funnel shape  and line the sides of them with rocks  so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly  when trodden upon by other animals  thus precipitating them into the monster    s dens  where their blood is immediately sucked  and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from  the caverns of death.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,pooh   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,continuing our progress  we perceived a district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,there were others that sprang from the substance of other vegetables        others that derived their substance from the bodies of living animals        and then again  there were others that glowed all over with intense fire        others that moved from place to place at pleasure        and what was still more wonderful  we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs at will and had  moreover  the detestable passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures  and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,pshaw   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,quitting this land  we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition  that they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the empire.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult problems  they were solved upon the spot the one by the bees  and the other by the birds  but the king keeping their solution a secret  it was only after the most profound researches and labor  and the writing of an infinity of big books  during a long series of years  that the men mathematicians at length arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the birds.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,oh my   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close upon another  from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth  and two hundred and forty miles long  so that  although they flew a mile during every minute  it required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us in which there were several millions of millions of fowl.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,oh fy   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,no sooner had we got rid of these birds  which occasioned us great annoyance  than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another kind  and infinitely larger than even the rocs which i met in my former voyages  for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio  oh  most munificent of caliphs.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive  but was fashioned entirely of belly  which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness  of a soft looking substance  smooth  shining and striped with various colors.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,in its talons  the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens  a house from which it had knocked off the roof  and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings  who  beyond doubt  were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we shouted with all our might  in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey  but it merely gave a snort or puff  as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand         stuff   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity  but which  nevertheless  was supported entirely upon the back of a sky blue cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,that  now  i believe   said the king   because i have read something of the kind before  in a book.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we passed immediately beneath this continent   swimming in between the legs of the cow   and  after some hours  found ourselves in a wonderful country indeed  which  i was informed by the man animal  was his own native land  inhabited by things of his own species.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this elevated the man animal very much in my esteem  and in fact  i now began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him  for i found that the man animals in general were a nation of the most powerful magicians  who lived with worms in their brain        which  no doubt  served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination         nonsense   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,among the magicians  were domesticated several animals of very singular kinds  for example  there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,in place of corn  he had black stones for his usual food  and yet  in spite of so hard a diet  he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest temple in this city  at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,twattle   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i saw  also  among these people a hen without feathers  but bigger than a camel  instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick  her blood  like that of the horse   to whom  in fact  she was nearly related   was boiling water  and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this hen brought forth very frequently  a hundred chickens in the day  and  after birth  they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of their mother.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,fal lal   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and wood  and leather  and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess  all the race of mankind with the exception of the great caliph  haroun alraschid.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another of these magi constructed  of like material  a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it  for so great were its reasoning powers that  in a second  it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor beast  but which had brains of lead  intermixed with a black matter like pitch  and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour  and this with so exquisite a precision  that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this thing was of prodigious strength  so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest empires at a breath  but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,ridiculous   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his veins the blood of the salamanders  for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had the faculty of converting the common metals into gold  without even looking at them during the process.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had such quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic body  while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times in a second.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,absurd   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another of these magicians  by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet saw  could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms  kick out their legs  fight  or even get up and dance at his will.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and indite a letter at bagdad or indeed at any distance whatsoever.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens  and it came at his call  and served him for a plaything when it came.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another made ice in a red hot furnace.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another directed the sun to paint his portrait  and the sun did.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another took this luminary with the moon and the planets  and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy  probed into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but the whole nation is  indeed  of so surprising a necromantic ability  that not even their infants  nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all  or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of creation.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,preposterous   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi       continued scheherazade  without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband      the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and refined  and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful  but for an unhappy fatality that besets them  and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has  hitherto  been adequate to save.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,some fatalities come in certain shapes  and some in others but this of which i speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,a what   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,a crotchet      said scheherazade.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,one of the evil genii  who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill  has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the small of the back.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,perfection of loveliness  they say  is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having been long possessed of this idea  and bolsters being cheap in that country  the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary         stop   said the king  i can    t stand that  and i won    t. you have already given me a dreadful headache with your lies.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the day  too  i perceive  is beginning to break.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,how long have we been married  my conscience is getting to be troublesome again.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,and then that dromedary touch do you take me for a fool  upon the whole  you might as well get up and be throttled.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,these words  as i learn from the  isits  ornot   both grieved and astonished scheherazade  but  as she knew the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity  and quite unlikely to forfeit his word  she submitted to her fate with a good grace.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,she derived  however  great consolation   during the tightening of the bowstring   from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold  and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward  in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.
A Decent into the Maelstrom, we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,not long ago   said he at length   and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons  but  about three years past  there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of and the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you suppose me a very old man but i am not.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white  to weaken my limbs  and to unstring my nerves  so that i tremble at the least exertion  and am frightened at a shadow.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,do you know i can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy    the  little cliff   upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it  while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge this  little cliff  arose  a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock  some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion  that i fell at full length upon the ground  clung to the shrubs around me  and dared not even glance upward at the sky while i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you must get over these fancies   said the guide   for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentioned and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we are now   he continued  in that particularizing manner which distinguished him  we are now close upon the norwegian coast in the sixty eighth degree of latitude in the great province of nordland and in the dreary district of lofoden.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the mountain upon whose top we sit is helseggen  the cloudy.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,now raise yourself up a little higher hold on to the grass if you feel giddy so and look out  beyond the belt of vapor beneath us  into the sea.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i looked dizzily  and beheld a wide expanse of ocean  whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographer    s account of the mare tenebrarum.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,to the right and left  as far as the eye could reach  there lay outstretched  like ramparts of the world  lines of horridly black and beetling cliff  whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest  howling and shrieking forever.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed  and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea  there was visible a small  bleak looking island  or  more properly  its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,about two miles nearer the land  arose another of smaller size  hideously craggy and barren  and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the appearance of the ocean  in the space between the more distant island and the shore  had something very unusual about it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,although  at the time  so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double reefed trysail  and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight  still there was here nothing like a regular swell  but only a short  quick  angry cross dashing of water in every direction as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the island in the distance   resumed the old man   is called by the norwegians vurrgh.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the one midway is moskoe.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,that a mile to the northward is ambaaren.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,yonder are islesen  hotholm  keildhelm  suarven  and buckholm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,farther off between moskoe and vurrgh are otterholm  flimen  sandflesen  and stockholm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these are the true names of the places but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all  is more than either you or i can understand.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,do you hear anything  do you see any change in the water    we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen  to which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden  so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as the old man spoke  i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound  like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie  and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us  was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,even while i gazed  this current acquired a monstrous velocity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,each moment added to its speed to its headlong impetuosity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in five minutes the whole sea  as far as vurrgh  was lashed into ungovernable fury  but it was between moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,here the vast bed of the waters  seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels  burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion heaving  boiling  hissing gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices  and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in a few minutes more  there came over the scene another radical alteration.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the general surface grew somewhat more smooth  and the whirlpools  one by one  disappeared  while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these streaks  at length  spreading out to a great distance  and entering into combination  took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices  and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,suddenly very suddenly this assumed a distinct and definite existence  in a circle of more than a mile in diameter.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray  but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel  whose interior  as far as the eye could fathom it  was a smooth  shining  and jet black wall of water  inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty five degrees  speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion  and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice  half shriek  half roar  such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the mountain trembled to its very base  and the rock rocked.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i threw myself upon my face  and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this   said i at length  to the old man  this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the maelstr  m.    so it is sometimes termed   said he.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we norwegians call it the moskoe str  m  from the island of moskoe in the midway.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,that of jonas ramus  which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any  cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence  or of the horror of the scene or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it  nor at what time  but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen  nor during a storm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there are some passages of his description  nevertheless  which may be quoted for their details  although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,between lofoden and moskoe   he says   the depth of the water is between thirty six and forty fathoms  but on the other side  toward ver  vurrgh  this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel  without the risk of splitting on the rocks  which happens even in the calmest weather.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when it is flood  the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity  but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts  the noise being heard several leagues off  and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth  that if a ship comes within its attraction  it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom  and there beat to pieces against the rocks  and when the water relaxes  the fragments thereof are thrown up again.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood  and in calm weather  and last but a quarter of an hour  its violence gradually returning.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when the stream is most boisterous  and its fury heightened by a storm  it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,boats  yachts  and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it likewise happens frequently  that whales come too near the stream  and are overpowered by its violence  and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a bear once  attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe  was caught by the stream and borne down  while he roared terribly  so as to be heard on shore.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,large stocks of firs and pine trees  after being absorbed by the current  rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks  among which they are whirled to and fro.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea it being constantly high and low water every six hours.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in the year       early in the morning of sexagesima sunday  it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in regard to the depth of the water  i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the  forty fathoms  must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the depth in the centre of the moskoe str  m must be immeasurably greater  and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of helseggen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below  i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records  as a matter difficult of belief  the anecdotes of the whales and the bears  for it appeared to me  in fact  a self evident thing  that the largest ship of the line in existence  coming within the influence of that deadly attraction  could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane  and must disappear bodily and at once.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the attempts to account for the phenomenon some of which  i remember  seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the idea generally received is that this  as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands   have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling  at flux and reflux  against a ridge of rocks and shelves  which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract  and thus the higher the flood rises  the deeper must the fall be  and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex  the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these are the words of the encyclop  dia britannica.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the maelstr  m is an abyss penetrating the globe  and issuing in some very remote part the gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this opinion  idle in itself  was the one to which  as i gazed  my imagination most readily assented  and  mentioning it to the guide  i was rather surprised to hear him say that  although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians  it nevertheless was not his own.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it  and here i agreed with him for  however conclusive on paper  it becomes altogether unintelligible  and even absurd  amid the thunder of the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you have had a good look at the whirl now   said the old man   and if you will creep round this crag  so as to get in its lee  and deaden the roar of the water  i will tell you a story that will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoe str  m.   i placed myself as desired  and he proceeded.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen  with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond moskoe  nearly to vurrgh.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing  at proper opportunities  if one has only the courage to attempt it  but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen  we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands  as i tell you.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there fish can be got at all hours  without much risk  and therefore these places are preferred.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the choice spots over here among the rocks  however  not only yield the finest variety  but in far greater abundance  so that we often got in a single day  what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in fact  we made it a matter of desperate speculation the risk of life standing instead of labor  and courage answering for capital.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this  and it was our practice  in fine weather  to take advantage of the fifteen minutes     slack to push across the main channel of the moskoe str  m  far above the pool  and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm  or sandflesen  where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,here we used to remain until nearly time for slack water again  when we weighed and made for home.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return and we seldom made a mis calculation upon this point.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,twice  during six years  we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm  which is a rare thing indeed just about here  and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week  starving to death  owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival  and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything   for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently  that  at length  we fouled our anchor and dragged it  if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents here to day and gone to morrow which drove us under the lee of flimen  where  by good luck  we brought up.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered     on the grounds     it is a bad spot to be in  even in good weather but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the moskoe str  m itself without accident  although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting  and then we made rather less way than we could wish  while the current rendered the smack unmanageable.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old  and i had two stout boys of my own.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these would have been of great assistance at such times  in using the sweeps  as well as afterward in fishing but  somehow  although we ran the risk ourselves  we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger for  after all is said and done  it was a horrible danger  and that is the truth.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was on the tenth day of july       a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,and yet all the morning  and indeed until late in the afternoon  there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south west  while the sun shone brightly  so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the three of us my two brothers and myself had crossed over to the islands about two o    clock p. m.  and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish  which  we all remarked  were more plenty that day than we had ever known them.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was just seven  by my watch  when we weighed and started for home  so as to make the worst of the str  m at slack water  which we knew would be at eight.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter  and for some time spanked along at a great rate  never dreaming of danger  for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this was most unusual something that had never happened to us before and i began to feel a little uneasy  without exactly knowing why.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we put the boat on the wind  but could make no headway at all for the eddies  and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage  when  looking astern  we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away  and we were dead becalmed  drifting about in every direction.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this state of things  however  did not last long enough to give us time to think about it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in less than a minute the storm was upon us in less than two the sky was entirely overcast and what with this and the driving spray  it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us  but  at the first puff  both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother  who had lashed himself to it for safety.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it had a complete flush deck  with only a small hatch near the bow  and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the str  m  by way of precaution against the chopping seas.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but for this circumstance we should have foundered at once for we lay entirely buried for some moments.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say  for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for my part  as soon as i had let the foresail run  i threw myself flat on deck  with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow  and with my hands grasping a ring bolt near the foot of the fore mast.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was mere instinct that prompted me to do this which was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have done for i was too much flurried to think.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some moments we were completely deluged  as i say  and all this time i held my breath  and clung to the bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees  still keeping hold with my hands  and thus got my head clear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,presently our little boat gave herself a shake  just as a dog does in coming out of the water  and thus rid herself  in some measure  of the seas.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me  and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done  when i felt somebody grasp my arm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was my elder brother  and my heart leaped for joy  for i had made sure that he was overboard but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror for he put his mouth close to my ear  and screamed out the word     moskoe str  m        no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew what he meant by that one word well enough i knew what he wished to make me understand.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,with the wind that now drove us on  we were bound for the whirl of the str  m  and nothing could save us    you perceive that in crossing the str  m channel  we always went a long way up above the whirl  even in the calmest weather  and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack but now we were driving right upon the pool itself  and in such a hurricane as this      to be sure      i thought      we shall get there just about the slack there is some little hope in that     but in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew very well that we were doomed  had we been ten times a ninety gun ship.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself  or perhaps we did not feel it so much  as we scudded before it  but at all events the seas  which at first had been kept down by the wind  and lay flat and frothing  now got up into absolute mountains.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a singular change  too  had come over the heavens.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,around in every direction it was still as black as pitch  but nearly overhead there burst out  all at once  a circular rift of clear sky as clear as i ever saw and of a deep bright blue and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness but  oh god  what a scene it was to light up    i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother but  in some manner which i could not understand  the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word  although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,presently he shook his head  looking as pale as death  and held up one of his fingers  as if to say     listen         at first i could not make out what he meant but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i dragged my watch from its fob.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was not going.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i glanced at its face by the moonlight  and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it had run down at seven o    clock  we were behind the time of the slack  and the whirl of the str  m was in full fury    when a boat is well built  properly trimmed  and not deep laden  the waves in a strong gale  when she is going large  seem always to slip from beneath her which appears very strange to a landsman and this is what is called riding  in sea phrase.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,well  so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly  but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter  and bore us with it as it rose up up as if into the sky.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,and then down we came with a sweep  a slide  and a plunge  that made me feel sick and dizzy  as if i was falling from some lofty mountain top in a dream.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance around and that one glance was all sufficient.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i saw our exact position in an instant.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the moskoe str  m whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead but no more like the every day moskoe str  m than the whirl as you now see it  is like a mill race.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,if i had not known where we were  and what we had to expect  i should not have recognised the place at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as it was  i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside  and were enveloped in foam.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard  and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek such a sound as you might imagine given out by the waste pipes of many thousand steam vessels  letting off their steam all together.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl  and i thought  of course  that another moment would plunge us into the abyss  down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all  but to skim like an air bubble upon the surface of the surge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,her starboard side was next the whirl  and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it may appear strange  but now  when we were in the very jaws of the gulf  i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,having made up my mind to hope no more  i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it may look like boasting but what i tell you is truth i began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner  and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life  in view of so wonderful a manifestation of god    s power.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i positively felt a wish to explore its depths  even at the sacrifice i was going to make  and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these  no doubt  were singular fancies to occupy a man    s mind in such extremity and i have often thought since  that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light headed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there was another circumstance which tended to restore my self possession  and this was the cessation of the wind  which could not reach us in our present situation for  as you saw yourself  the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean  and this latter now towered above us  a high  black  mountainous ridge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale  you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,they blind  deafen  and strangle you  and take away all power of action or reflection.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but we were now  in a great measure  rid of these annoyances just as death condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences  forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we careered round and round for perhaps an hour  flying rather than floating  getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge  and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,all this time i had never let go of the ring bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my brother was at the stern  holding on to a small empty water cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter  and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this  and made for the ring  from which  in the agony of his terror  he endeavored to force my hands  as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this act although i knew he was a madman when he did it a raving maniac through sheer fright.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i did not care  however  to contest the point with him.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all  so i let him have the bolt  and went astern to the cask.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this there was no great difficulty in doing  for the smack flew round steadily enough  and upon an even keel only swaying to and fro  with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,scarcely had i secured myself in my new position  when we gave a wild lurch to starboard  and rushed headlong into the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i muttered a hurried prayer to god  and thought all was over.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent  i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel  and closed my eyes.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some seconds i dared not open them while i expected instant destruction  and wondered that i was not already in my death struggles with the water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but moment after moment elapsed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i still lived.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the sense of falling had ceased  and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before  while in the belt of foam  with the exception that she now lay more along.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i took courage  and looked once again upon the scene.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,never shall i forget the sensations of awe  horror  and admiration with which i gazed about me.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat appeared to be hanging  as if by magic  midway down  upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference  prodigious in depth  and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony  but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around  and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth  as the rays of the full moon  from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described  streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls  and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when i recovered myself a little  however  my gaze fell instinctively downward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view  from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,she was quite upon an even keel that is to say  her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty five degrees  so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam ends.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i could not help observing  nevertheless  that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation  than if we had been upon a dead level  and this  i suppose  was owing to the speed at which we revolved.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf  but still i could make out nothing distinctly  on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped  and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow  like that narrow and tottering bridge which mussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this mist  or spray  was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel  as they all met together at the bottom but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist  i dare not attempt to describe.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our first slide into the abyss itself  from the belt of foam above  had carried us a great distance down the slope  but our farther descent was by no means proportionate.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,round and round we swept not with any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks  that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our progress downward  at each revolution  was slow  but very perceptible.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne  i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels  large masses of building timber and trunks of trees  with many smaller articles  such as pieces of house furniture  broken boxes  barrels and staves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i now began to watch  with a strange interest  the numerous things that floated in our company.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i must have been delirious  for i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this fir tree      i found myself at one time saying      will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears      and then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at length  after making several guesses of this nature  and being deceived in all this fact the fact of my invariable miscalculation  set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble  and my heart beat heavily once more.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was not a new terror that thus affected me  but the dawn of a more exciting hope.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this hope arose partly from memory  and partly from present observation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden  having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoe str  m. by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters but then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide  or  for some reason  had descended so slowly after entering  that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came  or of the ebb  as the case might be.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i conceived it possible  in either instance  that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean  without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early  or absorbed more rapidly.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i made  also  three important observations.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the first was  that  as a general rule  the larger the bodies were  the more rapid their descent the second  that  between two masses of equal extent  the one spherical  and the other of any other shape  the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere the third  that  between two masses of equal size  the one cylindrical  and the other of any other shape  the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,since my escape  i have had several conversations on this subject with an old school master of the district  and it was from him that i learned the use of the words     cylinder     and     sphere.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,he explained to me although i have forgotten the explanation how what i observed was  in fact  the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments and showed me how it happened that a cylinder  swimming in a vortex  offered more resistance to its suction  and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body  of any form whatever.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations  and rendering me anxious to turn them to account  and this was that  at every revolution  we passed something like a barrel  or else the yard or the mast of a vessel  while many of these things  which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool  were now high up above us  and seemed to have moved but little from their original station.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i no longer hesitated what to do.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held  to cut it loose from the counter  and to throw myself with it into the water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i attracted my brother    s attention by signs  pointed to the floating barrels that came near us  and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i thought at length that he comprehended my design but  whether this was the case or not  he shook his head despairingly  and refused to move from his station by the ring bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was impossible to reach him  the emergency admitted of no delay  and so  with a bitter struggle  i resigned him to his fate  fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter  and precipitated myself with it into the sea  without another moment    s hesitation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as it is myself who now tell you this tale as you see that i did escape and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected  and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to say i will bring my story quickly to conclusion.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it might have been an hour  or thereabout  after my quitting the smack  when  having descended to a vast distance beneath me  it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession  and  bearing my loved brother with it  plunged headlong  at once and forever  into the chaos of foam below.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard  before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the gyrations of the whirl grew  gradually  less and less violent.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,by degrees  the froth and the rainbow disappeared  and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the sky was clear  the winds had gone down  and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west  when i found myself on the surface of the ocean  in full view of the shores of lofoden  and above the spot where the pool of the moskoe str  m had been.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was the hour of the slack but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i was borne violently into the channel of the str  m  and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the     grounds     of the fishermen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a boat picked me up exhausted from fatigue and  now that the danger was removed  speechless from the memory of its horror.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit land.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my hair which had been raven black the day before  was as white as you see it now.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i told them my story they did not believe it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i now tell it to you and i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of lofoden.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery, after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago  to say nothing of the summary in     silliman    s journal      with the detailed statement just published by lieutenant maury  it will not be supposed  of course  that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to von kempelen    s discovery  i have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my object is simply  in the first place  to say a few words of von kempelen himself  with whom  some years ago  i had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance   since every thing which concerns him must necessarily  at this moment  be of interest  and  in the second place  to look in a general way  and speculatively  at the results of the discovery.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it may be as well  however  to premise the cursory observations which i have to offer  by denying  very decidedly  what seems to be a general impression  gleaned  as usual in a case of this kind  from the newspapers   viz.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that this discovery  astounding as it unquestionably is  is unanticipated.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,by reference to the     diary of sir humphrey davy      cottle and munroe  london  pp.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it will be seen at pp.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,and     that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question  but had actually made no inconsiderable progress  experimentally  in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by von kempelen  who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it  is  without doubt  i say it unhesitatingly  and can prove it  if required   indebted to the     diary     for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the paragraph from the     courier and enquirer      which is now going the rounds of the press  and which purports to claim the invention for a mr. kissam  of brunswick  maine  appears to me  i confess  a little apocryphal  for several reasons  although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i need not go into details.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it does not look true.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,persons who are narrating facts  are seldom so particular as mr. kissam seems to be  about day and date and precise location.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,besides  if mr. kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did  at the period designated nearly eight years ago how happens it that he took no steps  on the instant  to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually  if not to the world at large  from the discovery  it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what mr. kissam says he did  and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby so like an owl as mr. kissam admits that he did.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,by the way  who is mr. kissam  and is not the whole paragraph in the     courier and enquirer     a fabrication got up to     make a talk      it must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon hoaxy air.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,very little dependence is to be placed upon it  in my humble opinion  and if i were not well aware  from experience  how very easily men of science are mystified  on points out of their usual range of inquiry  i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as professor draper  discussing mr. kissam    s  or is it mr. quizzem    s   pretensions to the discovery  in so serious a tone.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,but to return to the     diary     of sir humphrey davy.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye  even upon the decease of the writer  as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,at page     for example  near the middle  we read  in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote      in less than half a minute the respiration being continued  diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that the respiration was not     diminished      is not only clear by the subsequent context  but by the use of the plural      were.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the sentence  no doubt  was thus intended      in less than half a minute  the respiration  being continued  these feelings  diminished gradually  and were succeeded by  a sensation  analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,a hundred similar instances go to show that the ms. so inconsiderately published  was merely a rough note book  meant only for the writer    s own eye  but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the fact is  sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery  but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical  so that  however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question  he would never have spoken out  until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched  could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this     diary      full of crude speculations  would have been unattended to  as  it seems  they were.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i say     his wishes      for that he meant to include this note book among the miscellaneous papers directed     to be burnt      i think there can be no manner of doubt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad  yet remains to be seen.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that the passages quoted above  with the other similar ones referred to  gave von kempelen the hint  i do not in the slightest degree question  but i repeat  it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself  momentous under any circumstances  will be of service or disservice to mankind at large.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that von kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest  it would be folly to doubt for a moment.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they will scarcely be so weak as not to     realize      in time  by large purchases of houses and land  with other property of intrinsic value.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in the brief account of von kempelen which appeared in the     home journal      and has since been extensively copied  several misapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by the translator  who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the presburg     schnellpost.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,viele     has evidently been misconceived  as it often is   and what the translator renders by     sorrows      is probably     lieden      which  in its true version      sufferings      would give a totally different complexion to the whole account  but  of course  much of this is merely guess  on my part.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,von kempelen  however  is by no means     a misanthrope      in appearance  at least  whatever he may be in fact.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my acquaintance with him was casual altogether  and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know him at all  but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained  or will attain in a few days  is not a small matter  as times go.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the literary world  speaks of him  confidently  as a native of presburg  misled  perhaps  by the account in  the home journal   but i am pleased in being able to state positively  since i have it from his own lips  that he was born in utica  in the state of new york  although both his parents  i believe  are of presburg descent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the family is connected  in some way  with m  elzel  of automaton chess player memory.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in person  he is short and stout  with large  fat  blue eyes  sandy hair and whiskers  a wide but pleasing mouth  fine teeth  and i think a roman nose.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,there is some defect in one of his feet.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his address is frank  and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,altogether  he looks  speaks  and acts as little like     a misanthrope     as any man i ever saw.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,we were fellow sojourners for a week about six years ago  at earl    s hotel  in providence  rhode island  and i presume that i conversed with him  at various times  for some three or four hours altogether.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his principal topics were those of the day  and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,he left the hotel before me  intending to go to new york  and thence to bremen  it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public  or  rather  it was there that he was first suspected of having made it.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,this is about all that i personally know of the now immortal von kempelen  but i have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions  entitled to about as much credit as the story of aladdin    s lamp  and yet  in a case of this kind  as in the case of the discoveries in california  it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the following anecdote  at least  is so well authenticated  that we may receive it implicitly.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at bremen  and often  it was well known  he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,when the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of gutsmuth   co.  suspicion was directed toward von kempelen  on account of his having purchased a considerable property in gasperitch lane  and his refusing  when questioned  to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,he was at length arrested  but nothing decisive appearing against him  was in the end set at liberty.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the police  however  kept a strict watch upon his movements  and thus discovered that he left home frequently  taking always the same road  and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the     dondergat.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,finally  by dint of great perseverance  they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories  in an alley called flatzplatz  and  coming upon him suddenly  found him  as they imagined  in the midst of his counterfeiting operations.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,after hand cuffing him  they searched his room  or rather rooms  for it appears he occupied all the mansarde.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,opening into the garret where they caught him  was a closet  ten feet by eight  fitted up with some chemical apparatus  of which the object has not yet been ascertained.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in one corner of the closet was a very small furnace  with a glowing fire in it  and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible two crucibles connected by a tube.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,one of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion  but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube  which was close to the brim.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the other crucible had some liquid in it  which  as the officers entered  seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they relate that  on finding himself taken  kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands  which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic   and threw the contents on the tiled floor.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it was now that they hand cuffed him  and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person  but nothing unusual was found about him  excepting a paper parcel  in his coat pocket  containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance  in nearly  but not quite  equal proportions.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have  so far  failed  but that it will ultimately be analyzed  is not to be doubted.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,passing out of the closet with their prisoner  the officers went through a sort of ante chamber  in which nothing material was found  to the chemist    s sleeping room.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they here rummaged some drawers and boxes  but discovered only a few papers  of no importance  and some good coin  silver and gold.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,at length  looking under the bed  they saw a large  common hair trunk  without hinges  hasp  or lock  and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed  they found that  with their united strength  there were three of them  all powerful men   they     could not stir it one inch.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,much astonished at this  one of them crawled under the bed  and looking into the trunk  said       no wonder we couldn    t move it why it    s full to the brim of old bits of brass       putting his feet  now  against the wall so as to get a good purchase  and pushing with all his force  while his companions pulled with all theirs  the trunk  with much difficulty  was slid out from under the bed  and its contents examined.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small  smooth pieces  varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar  but the pieces were irregular in shape  although more or less flat looking  upon the whole   very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state  and there suffered to grow cool.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,now  not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be anything but brass.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the idea of its being gold never entered their brains  of course  how could such a wild fancy have entered it  and their astonishment may be well conceived  when the next day it became known  all over bremen  that the  lot of brass  which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office  without putting themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap  was not only gold real gold but gold far finer than any employed in coinage gold  in fact  absolutely pure  virgin  without the slightest appreciable alloy.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i need not go over the details of von kempelen    s confession  as far as it went  and release  for these are familiar to the public.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that he has actually realized  in spirit and in effect  if not to the letter  the old chimaera of the philosopher    s stone  no sane person is at liberty to doubt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the opinions of arago are  of course  entitled to the greatest consideration  but he is by no means infallible  and what he says of bismuth  in his report to the academy  must be taken cum grano salis.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the simple truth is  that up to this period all analysis has failed  and until von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma  it is more than probable that the matter will remain  for years  in statu quo.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is  that     pure gold can be made at will  and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances  in kind and in proportions  unknown.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,speculation  of course  is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally  by the late developments in california  and this reflection brings us inevitably to another the exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelen    s analysis.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,if many were prevented from adventuring to california  by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value  on account of its plentifulness in the mines there  as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one what impression will be wrought now  upon the minds of those about to emigrate  and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region  by the announcement of this astounding discovery of von kempelen  a discovery which declares  in so many words  that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes  whatever that worth may be   gold now is  or at least soon will be  for it cannot be supposed that von kempelen can long retain his secret   of no greater value than lead  and of far inferior value to silver.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it is  indeed  exceedingly difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery  but one thing may be positively maintained that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of california.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in europe  as yet  the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in the price of lead  and nearly twenty five per cent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that of silver.
Mesmeric Revelation, whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism  its startling facts are now almost universally admitted.
Mesmeric Revelation,of these latter  those who doubt  are your mere doubters by profession an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.
Mesmeric Revelation,there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove  at the present day  that man  by mere exercise of will  can so impress his fellow  as to cast him into an abnormal condition  of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death  or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance  that  while in this state  the person so impressed employs only with effort  and then feebly  the external organs of sense  yet perceives  with keenly refined perception  and through channels supposed unknown  matters beyond the scope of the physical organs  that  moreover  his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated  that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound  and  finally  that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency  while  in the same proportion  the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced.
Mesmeric Revelation,i say that these which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features it would be supererogation to demonstrate  nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration  to day.
Mesmeric Revelation,my purpose at present is a very different one indeed.
Mesmeric Revelation,i am impelled  even in the teeth of a world of prejudice  to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy  occurring between a sleep waker and myself.
Mesmeric Revelation,i had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question  mr. vankirk   and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened.
Mesmeric Revelation,for many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis  the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations  and on the night of wednesday  the fifteenth instant  i was summoned to his bedside.
Mesmeric Revelation,the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart  and breathed with great difficulty  having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.
Mesmeric Revelation,in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres  but to night this had been attempted in vain.
Mesmeric Revelation,as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile  and although evidently in much bodily pain  appeared to be  mentally  quite at ease.
Mesmeric Revelation,i sent for you to night   he said   not so much to administer to my bodily ailment  as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which  of late  have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise.
Mesmeric Revelation,i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul    s immortality.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot deny that there has always existed  as if in that very soul which i have been denying  a vague half sentiment of its own existence.
Mesmeric Revelation,but this half sentiment at no time amounted to conviction.
Mesmeric Revelation,with it my reason had nothing to do.
Mesmeric Revelation,all attempts at logical inquiry resulted  indeed  in leaving me more sceptical than before.
Mesmeric Revelation,i had been advised to study cousin.
Mesmeric Revelation,i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes.
Mesmeric Revelation,the     charles elwood     of mr. brownson  for example  was placed in my hands.
Mesmeric Revelation,i read it with profound attention.
Mesmeric Revelation,throughout i found it logical  but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book.
Mesmeric Revelation,in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself.
Mesmeric Revelation,his end had plainly forgotten his beginning  like the government of trinculo.
Mesmeric Revelation,in short  i was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality  he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england  of france  and of germany.
Mesmeric Revelation,abstractions may amuse and exercise  but take no hold on the mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,here upon earth  at least  philosophy  i am persuaded  will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.
Mesmeric Revelation,the will may assent the soul the intellect  never.
Mesmeric Revelation,i repeat  then  that i only half felt  and never intellectually believed.
Mesmeric Revelation,but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling  until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason  that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two.
Mesmeric Revelation,i am enabled  too  plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which  in my abnormal existence  convinces  but which  in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena  does not extend  except through its effect  into my normal condition.
Mesmeric Revelation,in sleep waking  the reasoning and its conclusion the cause and its effect are present together.
Mesmeric Revelation,in my natural state  the cause vanishing  the effect only  and perhaps only partially  remains.
Mesmeric Revelation,these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.
Mesmeric Revelation,you have often observed the profound self cognizance evinced by the sleep waker the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself  and from this self cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism.
Mesmeric Revelation,i consented of course to make this experiment.
Mesmeric Revelation,a few passes threw mr. vankirk into the mesmeric sleep.
Mesmeric Revelation,his breathing became immediately more easy  and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.
Mesmeric Revelation,the following conversation then ensued  v. in the dialogue representing the patient  and p. myself.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. are you asleep   v. yes no  i would rather sleep more soundly.
Mesmeric Revelation,p.  after a few more passes.
Mesmeric Revelation,do you sleep now   v. yes.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. how do you think your present illness will result   v.  after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.
Mesmeric Revelation,i must die.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. does the idea of death afflict you   v.  very quickly.
Mesmeric Revelation,no no   p. are you pleased with the prospect   v. if i were awake i should like to die  but now it is no matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. i wish you would explain yourself  mr. vankirk.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. i am willing to do so  but it requires more effort than i feel able to make.
Mesmeric Revelation,you do not question me properly.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what then shall i ask   v. you must begin at the beginning.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. the beginning  but where is the beginning   v. you know that the beginning is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,this was said in a low  fluctuating tone  and with every sign of the most profound veneration.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what then  is god   v.  hesitating for many minutes.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot tell.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is not god spirit   v. while i was awake i knew what you meant by  spirit   but now it seems only a word such  for instance  as truth  beauty a quality  i mean.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is not god immaterial   v. there is no immateriality it is a mere word.
Mesmeric Revelation,that which is not matter  is not at all unless qualities are things.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is god  then  material   v. no.
Mesmeric Revelation,this reply startled me very much.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what  then  is he   v.  after a long pause  and mutteringly.
Mesmeric Revelation,i see but it is a thing difficult to tell.
Mesmeric Revelation,another long pause.
Mesmeric Revelation,he is not spirit  for he exists.
Mesmeric Revelation,nor is he matter  as you understand it.
Mesmeric Revelation,but there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing  the grosser impelling the finer  the finer pervading the grosser.
Mesmeric Revelation,the atmosphere  for example  impels the electric principle  while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere.
Mesmeric Revelation,these gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness  until we arrive at a matter unparticled without particles indivisible one  and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate  or unparticled matter  not only permeates all things but impels all things  and thus is all things within itself.
Mesmeric Revelation,this matter is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,what men attempt to embody in the word  thought   is this matter in motion.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking  and that the latter is the origin of the former.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes  and i now see the confusion of idea.
Mesmeric Revelation,motion is the action of mind  not of thinking.
Mesmeric Revelation,the unparticled matter  or god  in quiescence  is  as nearly as we can conceive it  what men call mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,and the power of self movement  equivalent in effect to human volition  is  in the unparticled matter  the result of its unity and omniprevalence  how i know not  and now clearly see that i shall never know.
Mesmeric Revelation,but the unparticled matter  set in motion by a law  or quality  existing within itself  is thinking.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter   v. the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation.
Mesmeric Revelation,we have  for example  a metal  a piece of wood  a drop of water  the atmosphere  a gas  caloric  electricity  the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,now we call all these things matter  and embrace all matter in one general definition  but in spite of this  there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal  and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,when we reach the latter  we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit  or with nihility.
Mesmeric Revelation,the only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution  and here  even  we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom  as something possessing in infinite minuteness  solidity  palpability  weight.
Mesmeric Revelation,destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity  or at least as matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,for want of a better word we might term it spirit.
Mesmeric Revelation,take  now  a step beyond the luminiferous ether conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether  as this ether is more rare than the metal  and we arrive at once  in spite of all the school dogmas  at a unique mass an unparticled matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,for although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves  the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.
Mesmeric Revelation,there will be a point there will be a degree of rarity  at which  if the atoms are sufficiently numerous  the interspaces must vanish  and the mass absolutely coalesce.
Mesmeric Revelation,but the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away  the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is clear  however  that it is as fully matter as before.
Mesmeric Revelation,the truth is  it is impossible to conceive spirit  since it is impossible to imagine what is not.
Mesmeric Revelation,when we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception  we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence  and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space a resistance now ascertained  it is true  to exist in some degree  but which is  nevertheless  so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of newton.
Mesmeric Revelation,we know that the resistance of bodies is  chiefly  in proportion to their density.
Mesmeric Revelation,absolute coalescence is absolute density.
Mesmeric Revelation,where there are no interspaces  there can be no yielding.
Mesmeric Revelation,an ether  absolutely dense  would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.
Mesmeric Revelation,as regards the progress of the star  it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it.
Mesmeric Revelation,there is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether  for  however rare this ether be supposed  it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend.
Mesmeric Revelation,the retardation actually experienced is  on the other hand  about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb.
Mesmeric Revelation,in the one case  the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself in the other it is endlessly accumulative.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but in all this in this identification of mere matter with god is there nothing of irreverence   i was forced to repeat this question before the sleep waker fully comprehended my meaning.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind  but you forget that the matter of which i speak is  in all respects  the very  mind  or  spirit  of the schools  so far as regards its high capacities  and is  moreover  the  matter  of these schools at the same time.
Mesmeric Revelation,god  with all the powers attributed to spirit  is but the perfection of matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you assert  then  that the unparticled matter  in motion  is thought   v. in general  this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,this thought creates.
Mesmeric Revelation,all created things are but the thoughts of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say   in general.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes.
Mesmeric Revelation,the universal mind is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,for new individualities  matter is necessary.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but you now speak of  mind  and  matter  as do the metaphysicians.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes to avoid confusion.
Mesmeric Revelation,when i say  mind   i mean the unparticled or ultimate matter  by  matter   i intend all else.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you were saying that  for new individualities matter is necessary.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes  for mind  existing unincorporate  is merely god.
Mesmeric Revelation,to create individual  thinking beings  it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus man is individualized.
Mesmeric Revelation,divested of corporate investiture  he were god.
Mesmeric Revelation,now  the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man  as the motion of the whole is that of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say that divested of the body man will be god   v.  after much hesitation.
Mesmeric Revelation,i could not have said this  it is an absurdity.
Mesmeric Revelation,p.  referring to my notes.
Mesmeric Revelation,you did say that  divested of corporate investiture man were god.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. and this is true.
Mesmeric Revelation,man thus divested would be god would be unindividualized.
Mesmeric Revelation,but he can never be thus divested at least never will be else we must imagine an action of god returning upon itself a purposeless and futile action.
Mesmeric Revelation,man is a creature.
Mesmeric Revelation,creatures are thoughts of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. i do not comprehend.
Mesmeric Revelation,you say that man will never put off the body   v. i say that he will never be bodiless.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. explain.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. there are two bodies the rudimental and the complete  corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.
Mesmeric Revelation,what we call  death   is but the painful metamorphosis.
Mesmeric Revelation,our present incarnation is progressive  preparatory  temporary.
Mesmeric Revelation,our future is perfected  ultimate  immortal.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate life is the full design.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but of the worm    s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. we  certainly but not the worm.
Mesmeric Revelation,the matter of which our rudimental body is composed  is within the ken of the organs of that body  or  more distinctly  our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body  but not to that of which the ultimate is composed.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses  and we perceive only the shell which falls  in decaying  from the inner form  not that inner form itself  but this inner form  as well as the shell  is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death.
Mesmeric Revelation,how is this   v. when i say that it resembles death  i mean that it resembles the ultimate life  for when i am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance  and i perceive external things directly  without organs  through a medium which i shall employ in the ultimate  unorganized life.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. unorganized   v. yes  organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter  to the exclusion of other classes and forms.
Mesmeric Revelation,the organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition  and to that only  his ultimate condition  being unorganized  is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one the nature of the volition of god that is to say  the motion of the unparticled matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.
Mesmeric Revelation,this it is not  but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is.
Mesmeric Revelation,a luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina  these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve.
Mesmeric Revelation,the nerve conveys similar ones to the brain  the brain  also  similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.
Mesmeric Revelation,the motion of this latter is thought  of which perception is the first undulation.
Mesmeric Revelation,this is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world  and this external world is  to the rudimental life  limited  through the idiosyncrasy of its organs.
Mesmeric Revelation,but in the ultimate  unorganized life  the external world reaches the whole body   which is of a substance having affinity to brain  as i have said   with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous  and to this ether in unison with it the whole body vibrates  setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs  therefore  that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life.
Mesmeric Revelation,to rudimental beings  organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you speak of rudimental  beings.
Mesmeric Revelation,are there other rudimental thinking beings than man   v. the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul    planets  suns  and other bodies which are neither nebul    suns  nor planets  is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.
Mesmeric Revelation,but for the necessity of the rudimental  prior to the ultimate life  there would have been no bodies such as these.
Mesmeric Revelation,each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic  rudimental  thinking creatures.
Mesmeric Revelation,in all  the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted.
Mesmeric Revelation,at death  or metamorphosis  these creatures  enjoying the ultimate life immortality and cognizant of all secrets but the one  act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition  indwelling  not the stars  which to us seem the sole palpabilities  and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created but that space itself that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star shadows blotting them out as non entities from the perception of the angels.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say that  but for the necessity of the rudimental life  there would have been no stars.
Mesmeric Revelation,but why this necessity   v. in the inorganic life  as well as in the inorganic matter generally  there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law the divine volition.
Mesmeric Revelation,with the view of producing impediment  the organic life and matter   complex  substantial  and law encumbered   were contrived.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but again why need this impediment have been produced   v. the result of law inviolate is perfection right negative happiness.
Mesmeric Revelation,the result of law violate is imperfection  wrong  positive pain.
Mesmeric Revelation,through the impediments afforded by the number  complexity  and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter  the violation of law is rendered  to a certain extent  practicable.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus pain  which in the inorganic life is impossible  is possible in the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible   v. all things are either good or bad by comparison.
Mesmeric Revelation,a sufficient analysis will show that pleasure  in all cases  is but the contrast of pain.
Mesmeric Revelation,positive pleasure is a mere idea.
Mesmeric Revelation,to be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same.
Mesmeric Revelation,never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.
Mesmeric Revelation,but it has been shown that  in the inorganic life  pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,the pain of the primitive life of earth  is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in heaven.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. still  there is one of your expressions which i find it impossible to comprehend  the truly substantive vastness of infinity.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. this  probably  is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term  substance  itself.
Mesmeric Revelation,we must not regard it as a quality  but as a sentiment  it is the perception  in thinking beings  of the adaptation of matter to their organization.
Mesmeric Revelation,there are many things on the earth  which would be nihility to the inhabitants of venus many things visible and tangible in venus  which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all.
Mesmeric Revelation,but to the inorganic beings to the angels the whole of the unparticled matter is substance that is to say  the whole of what we term  space  is to them the truest substantiality  the stars  meantime  through what we consider their materiality  escaping the angelic sense  just in proportion as the unparticled matter  through what we consider its immateriality  eludes the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,as the sleep waker pronounced these latter words  in a feeble tone  i observed on his countenance a singular expression  which somewhat alarmed me  and induced me to awake him at once.
Mesmeric Revelation,no sooner had i done this  than  with a bright smile irradiating all his features  he fell back upon his pillow and expired.
Mesmeric Revelation,i noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.
Mesmeric Revelation,his brow was of the coldness of ice.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus  ordinarily  should it have appeared  only after long pressure from azrael    s hand.
Mesmeric Revelation,had the sleep waker  indeed  during the latter portion of his discourse  been addressing me from out the region of the shadows
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar, of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder  that the extraordinary case of m. valdemar has excited discussion.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it would have been a miracle had it not especially under the circumstances.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,through the desire of all parties concerned  to keep the affair from the public  at least for the present  or until we had farther opportunities for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society  and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations  and  very naturally  of a great deal of disbelief.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i comprehend them myself.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,they are  succinctly  these   my attention  for the last three years  had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism  and  about nine months ago it occurred to me  quite suddenly  that in the series of experiments made hitherto  there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission  no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it remained to be seen  first  whether  in such condition  there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence  secondly  whether  if any existed  it was impaired or increased by the condition  thirdly  to what extent  or for how long a period  the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there were other points to be ascertained  but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial  from the immensely important character of its consequences.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars  i was brought to think of my friend  m. ernest valdemar  the well known compiler of the  bibliotheca forensica   and author  under the nom de plume of issachar marx  of the polish versions of  wallenstein  and  gargantua.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,m. valdemar  who has resided principally at harlem  n.y.  since the year       is  or was  particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much resembling those of john randolph  and  also  for the whiteness of his whiskers  in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter  in consequence  being very generally mistaken for a wig.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his temperament was markedly nervous  and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty  but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his will was at no period positively  or thoroughly  under my control  and in regard to clairvoyance  i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him  his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was his custom  indeed  to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution  as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me  it was of course very natural that i should think of m. valdemar.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him  and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i spoke to him frankly upon the subject  and  to my surprise  his interest seemed vividly excited.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i say to my surprise  for  although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments  he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death  and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it is now rather more than seven months since i received  from m. valdemar himself  the subjoined note   my dear p     you may as well come now.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,d   and f   are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond to morrow midnight  and i think they have hit the time very nearly.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,valdemar  i received this note within half an hour after it was written  and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man    s chamber.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i had not seen him for ten days  and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his face wore a leaden hue  the eyes were utterly lustreless  and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek bones.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his expectoration was excessive.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the pulse was barely perceptible.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he retained  nevertheless  in a very remarkable manner  both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid and  when i entered the room  was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket book.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he was propped up in the bed by pillows.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,doctors d   and f   were in attendance.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after pressing valdemar    s hand  i took these gentlemen aside  and obtained from them a minute account of the patient    s condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi osseous or cartilaginous state  and was  of course  entirely useless for all purposes of vitality.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the right  in its upper portion  was also partially  if not thoroughly  ossified  while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles  running one into another.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,several extensive perforations existed  and  at one point  permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity  no sign of it had been discovered a month before  and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,independently of the phthisis  the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta  but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was the opinion of both physicians that m. valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow  sunday .
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was then seven o    clock on saturday evening.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,on quitting the invalid    s bed side to hold conversation with myself  doctors d   and f   had bidden him a final farewell.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it had not been their intention to return  but  at my request  they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when they had gone  i spoke freely with m. valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution  as well as  more particularly  of the experiment proposed.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made  and urged me to commence it at once.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,a male and a female nurse were in attendance  but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people  in case of sudden accident  might prove.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night  when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance   mr. theodore l l   relieved me from farther embarrassment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it had been my design  originally  to wait for the physicians  but i was induced to proceed  first  by the urgent entreaties of m. valdemar  and secondly  by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose  as he was evidently sinking fast.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,mr. l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred  and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is  for the most part  either condensed or copied verbatim.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it wanted about five minutes of eight when  taking the patient    s hand  i begged him to state  as distinctly as he could  to mr. l l  whether he  m. valdemar  was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he replied feebly  yet quite audibly   yes  i wish to be.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i fear you have mesmerized  adding immediately afterwards   i fear you have deferred it too long.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,while he spoke thus  i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead  but although i exerted all my powers  no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o    clock  when doctors d   and f   called  according to appointment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i explained to them  in a few words  what i designed  and as they opposed no objection  saying that the patient was already in the death agony  i proceeded without hesitation exchanging  however  the lateral passes for downward ones  and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous  and at intervals of half a minute.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at the expiration of this period  however  a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man  and the stertorous breathing ceased that is to say  its stertorousness was no longer apparent  the intervals were undiminished.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the patient    s extremities were of an icy coldness.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep waking  and which it is quite impossible to mistake.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver  as in incipient sleep  and with a few more i closed them altogether.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i was not satisfied  however  with this  but continued the manipulations vigorously  and with the fullest exertion of the will  until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer  after placing them in a seemingly easy position.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the legs were at full length  the arms were nearly so  and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the head was very slightly elevated.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when i had accomplished this  it was fully midnight  and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m. valdemar    s condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after a few experiments  they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,dr. d   resolved at once to remain with the patient all night  while dr. f   took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,mr. l l and the nurses remained.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,we left m. valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o    clock in the morning  when i approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr. f   went away that is to say  he lay in the same position  the pulse was imperceptible  the breathing was gentle  scarcely noticeable  unless through the application of a mirror to the lips   the eyes were closed naturally  and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,still  the general appearance was certainly not that of death.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,as i approached m. valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own  as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in such experiments with this patient  i had never perfectly succeeded before  and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now  but to my astonishment  his arm very readily  although feebly  followed every direction i assigned it with mine.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i determined to hazard a few words of conversation.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,m. valdemar   i said   are you asleep   he made no answer  but i perceived a tremor about the lips  and was thus induced to repeat the question  again and again.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at its third repetition  his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering  the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the ball  the lips moved sluggishly  and from between them  in a barely audible whisper  issued the words    yes  asleep now.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,do not wake me  let me die so    i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the right arm  as before  obeyed the direction of my hand.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i questioned the sleep waker again    do you still feel pain in the breast  m. valdemar    the answer now was immediate  but even less audible than before    no pain i am dying.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then  and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr. f    who came a little before sunrise  and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips  he requested me to speak to the sleep waker again.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did so  saying    m. valdemar  do you still sleep    as before  some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made  and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i concluded  however  to speak to him once more  and merely repeated my previous question.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,while i spoke  there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep waker.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the eyes rolled themselves slowly open  the pupils disappearing upwardly  the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue  resembling not so much parchment as white paper  and the circular hectic spots which  hitherto  had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek  went out at once.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i use this expression  because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there are  indeed  two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part  i might say  for example  that the sound was harsh  and broken and hollow  but the hideous whole is indescribable  for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there were two particulars  nevertheless  which i thought then  and still think  might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in the first place  the voice seemed to reach our ears at least mine from a vast distance  or from some deep cavern within the earth.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in the second place  it impressed me  i fear  indeed  that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended  as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was evident that  so far  death  or what is usually termed death  had been arrested by the mesmeric process.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m. valdemar would be merely to insure his instant  or at least his speedy  dissolution.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly seven months we continued to make daily calls at m. valdemar    s house  accompanied  now and then  by medical and other friends.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,all this time the sleeper waker remained exactly as i have last described him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the nurses     attentions were continual.
The Facts in the Case of M.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did so  as follows    m. valdemar  can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now    there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks  the tongue quivered  or rather rolled violently in the mouth  although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before   and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described  broke forth    for god    s sake  quick  quick  put me to sleep or  quick  waken me  quick  i say to you that i am dead    i was thoroughly unnerved  and for an instant remained undecided what to do.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at first i made an endeavor to recompose the patient  but  failing in this through total abeyance of the will  i retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in this attempt i soon saw that i should be successful or at least i soon fancied that my success would be complete and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,for what really occurred  however  it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes  amid ejaculations of  dead  dead   absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer  his whole frame at once within the space of a single minute  or even less  shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,upon the bed  before that whole company  there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome of detestable putrescence.
The Black Cat, for the most wild  yet most homely narrative which i am about to pen  i neither expect nor solicit belief.
The Black Cat,mad indeed would i be to expect it  in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.
The Black Cat,yet  mad am i not and very surely do i not dream.
The Black Cat,but to morrow i die  and to day i would unburthen my soul.
The Black Cat,my immediate purpose is to place before the world  plainly  succinctly  and without comment  a series of mere household events.
The Black Cat,in their consequences  these events have terrified have tortured have destroyed me.
The Black Cat,yet i will not attempt to expound them.
The Black Cat,to me  they have presented little but horror to many they will seem less terrible than barroques.
The Black Cat,hereafter  perhaps  some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common place some intellect more calm  more logical  and far less excitable than my own  which will perceive  in the circumstances i detail with awe  nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.
The Black Cat,from my infancy i was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.
The Black Cat,my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.
The Black Cat,i was especially fond of animals  and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.
The Black Cat,with these i spent most of my time  and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.
The Black Cat,this peculiarity of character grew with my growth  and in my manhood  i derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.
The Black Cat,to those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog  i need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable.
The Black Cat,there is something in the unselfish and self sacrificing love of a brute  which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man.
The Black Cat,i married early  and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.
The Black Cat,observing my partiality for domestic pets  she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind.
The Black Cat,we had birds  gold fish  a fine dog  rabbits  a small monkey  and a cat.
The Black Cat,this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal  entirely black  and sagacious to an astonishing degree.
The Black Cat,in speaking of his intelligence  my wife  who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition  made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion  which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise.
The Black Cat,not that she was ever serious upon this point and i mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens  just now  to be remembered.
The Black Cat,pluto this was the cat    s name was my favorite pet and playmate.
The Black Cat,i alone fed him  and he attended me wherever i went about the house.
The Black Cat,it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from following me through the streets.
The Black Cat,our friendship lasted  in this manner  for several years  during which my general temperament and character through the instrumentality of the fiend intemperance had  i blush to confess it  experienced a radical alteration for the worse.
The Black Cat,i grew  day by day  more moody  more irritable  more regardless of the feelings of others.
The Black Cat,i suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife.
The Black Cat,at length  i even offered her personal violence.
The Black Cat,my pets  of course  were made to feel the change in my disposition.
The Black Cat,i not only neglected  but ill used them.
The Black Cat,for pluto  however  i still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him  as i made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits  the monkey  or even the dog  when by accident  or through affection  they came in my way.
The Black Cat,but my disease grew upon me for what disease is like alcohol  and at length even pluto  who was now becoming old  and consequently somewhat peevish even pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.
The Black Cat,one night  returning home  much intoxicated  from one of my haunts about town  i fancied that the cat avoided my presence.
The Black Cat,i seized him  when  in his fright at my violence  he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.
The Black Cat,the fury of a demon instantly possessed me.
The Black Cat,i knew myself no longer.
The Black Cat,my original soul seemed  at once  to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence  gin nurtured  thrilled every fibre of my frame.
The Black Cat,i took from my waistcoat pocket a pen knife  opened it  grasped the poor beast by the throat  and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket  i blush  i burn  i shudder  while i pen the damnable atrocity.
The Black Cat,when reason returned with the morning when i had slept off the fumes of the night    s debauch i experienced a sentiment half of horror  half of remorse  for the crime of which i had been guilty  but it was  at best  a feeble and equivocal feeling  and the soul remained untouched.
The Black Cat,i again plunged into excess  and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.
The Black Cat,in the meantime the cat slowly recovered.
The Black Cat,the socket of the lost eye presented  it is true  a frightful appearance  but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain.
The Black Cat,he went about the house as usual  but  as might be expected  fled in extreme terror at my approach.
The Black Cat,i had so much of my old heart left  as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.
The Black Cat,but this feeling soon gave place to irritation.
The Black Cat,and then came  as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow  the spirit of perverseness.
The Black Cat,of this spirit philosophy takes no account.
The Black Cat,yet i am not more sure that my soul lives  than i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart one of the indivisible primary faculties  or sentiments  which give direction to the character of man.
The Black Cat,who has not  a hundred times  found himself committing a vile or a silly action  for no other reason than because he knows he should not  have we not a perpetual inclination  in the teeth of our best judgment  to violate that which is law  merely because we understand it to be such  this spirit of perverseness  i say  came to my final overthrow.
The Black Cat,it was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself to offer violence to its own nature to do wrong for the wrong    s sake only that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the unoffending brute.
The Black Cat,one morning  in cool blood  i slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree  hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes  and with the bitterest remorse at my heart  hung it because i knew that it had loved me  and because i felt it had given me no reason of offence  hung it because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sin a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it if such a thing wore possible even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible god.
The Black Cat,on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done  i was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.
The Black Cat,the curtains of my bed were in flames.
The Black Cat,the whole house was blazing.
The Black Cat,it was with great difficulty that my wife  a servant  and myself  made our escape from the conflagration.
The Black Cat,the destruction was complete.
The Black Cat,my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up  and i resigned myself thenceforward to despair.
The Black Cat,i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect  between the disaster and the atrocity.
The Black Cat,but i am detailing a chain of facts and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.
The Black Cat,on the day succeeding the fire  i visited the ruins.
The Black Cat,the walls  with one exception  had fallen in.
The Black Cat,this exception was found in a compartment wall  not very thick  which stood about the middle of the house  and against which had rested the head of my bed.
The Black Cat,the plastering had here  in great measure  resisted the action of the fire a fact which i attributed to its having been recently spread.
The Black Cat,about this wall a dense crowd were collected  and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention.
The Black Cat,the words  strange    singular   and other similar expressions  excited my curiosity.
The Black Cat,i approached and saw  as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface  the figure of a gigantic cat.
The Black Cat,the impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.
The Black Cat,there was a rope about the animal    s neck.
The Black Cat,when i first beheld this apparition for i could scarcely regard it as less my wonder and my terror were extreme.
The Black Cat,but at length reflection came to my aid.
The Black Cat,the cat  i remembered  had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house.
The Black Cat,upon the alarm of fire  this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown  through an open window  into my chamber.
The Black Cat,this had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep.
The Black Cat,the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly spread plaster  the lime of which  with the flames  and the ammonia from the carcass  had then accomplished the portraiture as i saw it.
The Black Cat,although i thus readily accounted to my reason  if not altogether to my conscience  for the startling fact just detailed  it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy.
The Black Cat,for months i could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat  and  during this period  there came back into my spirit a half sentiment that seemed  but was not  remorse.
The Black Cat,i went so far as to regret the loss of the animal  and to look about me  among the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented  for another pet of the same species  and of somewhat similar appearance  with which to supply its place.
The Black Cat,one night as i sat  half stupefied  in a den of more than infamy  my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object  reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin  or of rum  which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.
The Black Cat,i had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes  and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had not sooner perceived the object thereupon.
The Black Cat,i approached it  and touched it with my hand.
The Black Cat,it was a black cat a very large one fully as large as pluto  and closely resembling him in every respect but one.
The Black Cat,pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body  but this cat had a large  although indefinite splotch of white  covering nearly the whole region of the breast.
The Black Cat,upon my touching him  he immediately arose  purred loudly  rubbed against my hand  and appeared delighted with my notice.
The Black Cat,this  then  was the very creature of which i was in search.
The Black Cat,i at once offered to purchase it of the landlord  but this person made no claim to it knew nothing of it had never seen it before.
The Black Cat,i continued my caresses  and  when i prepared to go home  the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.
The Black Cat,i permitted it to do so  occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded.
The Black Cat,when it reached the house it domesticated itself at once  and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.
The Black Cat,for my own part  i soon found a dislike to it arising within me.
The Black Cat,this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated  but i know not how or why it was its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed.
The Black Cat,by slow degrees  these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.
The Black Cat,i avoided the creature  a certain sense of shame  and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty  preventing me from physically abusing it.
The Black Cat,i did not  for some weeks  strike  or otherwise violently ill use it  but gradually very gradually i came to look upon it with unutterable loathing  and to flee silently from its odious presence  as from the breath of a pestilence.
The Black Cat,what added  no doubt  to my hatred of the beast  was the discovery  on the morning after i brought it home  that  like pluto  it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.
The Black Cat,this circumstance  however  only endeared it to my wife  who  as i have already said  possessed  in a high degree  that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait  and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.
The Black Cat,with my aversion to this cat  however  its partiality for myself seemed to increase.
The Black Cat,it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.
The Black Cat,whenever i sat  it would crouch beneath my chair  or spring upon my knees  covering me with its loathsome caresses.
The Black Cat,if i arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down  or  fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress  clamber  in this manner  to my breast.
The Black Cat,at such times  although i longed to destroy it with a blow  i was yet withheld from so doing  partly by a memory of my former crime  but chiefly let me confess it at once by absolute dread of the beast.
The Black Cat,this dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil and yet i should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.
The Black Cat,i am almost ashamed to own yes  even in this felon    s cell  i am almost ashamed to own that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me  had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive.
The Black Cat,my wife had called my attention  more than once  to the character of the mark of white hair  of which i have spoken  and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had destroyed.
The Black Cat,the reader will remember that this mark  although large  had been originally very indefinite  but  by slow degrees degrees nearly imperceptible  and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful it had  at length  assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline.
The Black Cat,it was now the representation of an object that i shudder to name and for this  above all  i loathed  and dreaded  and would have rid myself of the monster had i dared it was now  i say  the image of a hideous of a ghastly thing of the gallows  oh  mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime of agony and of death   and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity.
The Black Cat,and a brute beast  whose fellow i had contemptuously destroyed a brute beast to work out for me for me a man  fashioned in the image of the high god so much of insufferable woe  alas  neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of rest any more  during the former the creature left me no moment alone  and in the latter i started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face  and its vast weight an incarnate nightmare that i had no power to shake off incumbent eternally upon my heart   beneath the pressure of torments such as these  the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed.
The Black Cat,evil thoughts became my sole intimates the darkest and most evil of thoughts.
The Black Cat,the moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind  while  from the sudden  frequent  and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned myself  my uncomplaining wife  alas  was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.
The Black Cat,one day she accompanied me  upon some household errand  into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit.
The Black Cat,the cat followed me down the steep stairs  and  nearly throwing me headlong  exasperated me to madness.
The Black Cat,uplifting an axe  and forgetting  in my wrath  the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand  i aimed a blow at the animal which  of course  would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i wished.
The Black Cat,but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.
The Black Cat,goaded  by the interference  into a rage more than demoniacal  i withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.
The Black Cat,she fell dead upon the spot  without a groan.
The Black Cat,this hideous murder accomplished  i set myself forthwith  and with entire deliberation  to the task of concealing the body.
The Black Cat,i knew that i could not remove it from the house  either by day or by night  without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.
The Black Cat,many projects entered my mind.
The Black Cat,at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments  and destroying them by fire.
The Black Cat,at another  i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar.
The Black Cat,again  i deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard about packing it in a box  as if merchandise  with the usual arrangements  and so getting a porter to take it from the house.
The Black Cat,finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than either of these.
The Black Cat,i determined to wall it up in the cellar as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.
The Black Cat,for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.
The Black Cat,its walls were loosely constructed  and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster  which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening.
The Black Cat,moreover  in one of the walls was a projection  caused by a false chimney  or fireplace  that had been filled up  and made to resemble the red of the cellar.
The Black Cat,i made no doubt that i could readily displace the bricks at this point  insert the corpse  and wall the whole up as before  so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious.
The Black Cat,and in this calculation i was not deceived.
The Black Cat,by means of a crow bar i easily dislodged the bricks  and  having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall  i propped it in that position  while  with little trouble  i re laid the whole structure as it originally stood.
The Black Cat,having procured mortar  sand  and hair  with every possible precaution  i prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old  and with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork.
The Black Cat,when i had finished  i felt satisfied that all was right.
The Black Cat,the wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed.
The Black Cat,the rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.
The Black Cat,i looked around triumphantly  and said to myself   here at least  then  my labor has not been in vain.
The Black Cat,my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness  for i had  at length  firmly resolved to put it to death.
The Black Cat,had i been able to meet with it  at the moment  there could have been no doubt of its fate  but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger  and forebore to present itself in my present mood.
The Black Cat,it is impossible to describe  or to imagine  the deep  the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom.
The Black Cat,it did not make its appearance during the night  and thus for one night at least  since its introduction into the house  i soundly and tranquilly slept  aye  slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul   the second and the third day passed  and still my tormentor came not.
The Black Cat,once again i breathed as a freeman.
The Black Cat,the monster  in terror  had fled the premises forever  i should behold it no more  my happiness was supreme  the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little.
The Black Cat,some few inquiries had been made  but these had been readily answered.
The Black Cat,even a search had been instituted but of course nothing was to be discovered.
The Black Cat,i looked upon my future felicity as secured.
The Black Cat,upon the fourth day of the assassination  a party of the police came  very unexpectedly  into the house  and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises.
The Black Cat,secure  however  in the inscrutability of my place of concealment  i felt no embarrassment whatever.
The Black Cat,the officers bade me accompany them in their search.
The Black Cat,they left no nook or corner unexplored.
The Black Cat,at length  for the third or fourth time  they descended into the cellar.
The Black Cat,i quivered not in a muscle.
The Black Cat,my heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence.
The Black Cat,i walked the cellar from end to end.
The Black Cat,i folded my arms upon my bosom  and roamed easily to and fro.
The Black Cat,the police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.
The Black Cat,the glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained.
The Black Cat,i burned to say if but one word  by way of triumph  and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.
The Black Cat,gentlemen   i said at last  as the party ascended the steps   i delight to have allayed your suspicions.
The Black Cat,i wish you all health  and a little more courtesy.
The Black Cat,by the bye  gentlemen  this this is a very well constructed house.
The Black Cat,in the rabid desire to say something easily  i scarcely knew what i uttered at all.
The Black Cat,i may say an excellently well constructed house.
The Black Cat,these walls are you going  gentlemen  these walls are solidly put together   and here  through the mere phrenzy of bravado  i rapped heavily  with a cane which i held in my hand  upon that very portion of the brick work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.
The Black Cat,but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the arch fiend  no sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence  than i was answered by a voice from within the tomb  by a cry  at first muffled and broken  like the sobbing of a child  and then quickly swelling into one long  loud  and continuous scream  utterly anomalous and inhuman a howl a wailing shriek  half of horror and half of triumph  such as might have arisen only out of hell  conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
The Black Cat,of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.
The Black Cat,swooning  i staggered to the opposite wall.
The Black Cat,for one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless  through extremity of terror and of awe.
The Black Cat,in the next  a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall.
The Black Cat,it fell bodily.
The Black Cat,the corpse  already greatly decayed and clotted with gore  stood erect before the eyes of the spectators.

The Fall of the House of Usher,a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity  for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind  and the exceeding density of the clouds  which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house  did not prevent our perceiving the life like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other  without passing away into the distance.

The Fall of the House of Usher,here is one of your favorite romances.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i will read  and you shall listen  and so we will pass away this terrible night together.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the antique volume which i had taken up was the  mad trist  of sir launcelot canning  but i had called it a favorite of usher    s more in sad jest than in earnest  for  in truth  there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.
The Fall of the House of Usher,it was  however  the only book immediately at hand  and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac  might find relief  for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies  even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read.
The Fall of the House of Usher,could i have judged  indeed  by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened  or apparently harkened  to the words of the tale  i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i had arrived at that well known portion of the story where ethelred  the hero of the trist  having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit  proceeds to make good an entrance by force.
The Fall of the House of Usher,here  it will be remembered  the words of the narrative run thus    and ethelred  who was by nature of a doughty heart  and who was now mighty withal  on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken  waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit  who  in sooth  was of an obstinate and maliceful turn  but  feeling the rain upon his shoulders  and fearing the rising of the tempest  uplifted his mace outright  and  with blows  made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand  and now pulling therewith sturdily  he so cracked  and ripped  and tore all asunder  that the noise of the dry and hollow sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.
The Fall of the House of Usher,at the termination of this sentence i started  and for a moment  paused  for it appeared to me  although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me  it appeared to me that  from some very remote portion of the mansion  there came  indistinctly  to my ears  what might have been  in its exact similarity of character  the echo  but a stifled and dull one certainly  of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described.
The Fall of the House of Usher,it was  beyond doubt  the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention  for  amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements  and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm  the sound  in itself  had nothing  surely  which should have interested or disturbed me.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i continued the story    but the good champion ethelred  now entering within the door  was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit  but  in the stead thereof  a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor  and of a fiery tongue  which sate in guard before a palace of gold  with a floor of silver  and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten   who entereth herein  a conqueror hath bin  who slayeth the dragon  the shield he shall win   and ethelred uplifted his mace  and struck upon the head of the dragon  which fell before him  and gave up his pesty breath  with a shriek so horrid and harsh  and withal so piercing  that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it  the like whereof was never before heard.
The Fall of the House of Usher,here again i paused abruptly  and now with a feeling of wild amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that  in this instance  i did actually hear  although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say  a low and apparently distant  but harsh  protracted  and most unusual screaming or grating sound the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon    s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.
The Fall of the House of Usher,oppressed  as i certainly was  upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence  by a thousand conflicting sensations  in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant  i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting  by any observation  the sensitive nervousness of my companion.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question  although  assuredly  a strange alteration had  during the last few minutes  taken place in his demeanor.
The Fall of the House of Usher,from a position fronting my own  he had gradually brought round his chair  so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber  and thus i could but partially perceive his features  although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.
The Fall of the House of Usher,his head had dropped upon his breast yet i knew that he was not asleep  from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the motion of his body  too  was at variance with this idea for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
The Fall of the House of Usher,having rapidly taken notice of all this  i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot  which thus proceeded    and now  the champion  having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon  bethinking himself of the brazen shield  and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it  removed the carcass from out of the way before him  and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall  which in sooth tarried not for his full coming  but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor  with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.
The Fall of the House of Usher,no sooner had these syllables passed my lips  than as if a shield of brass had indeed  at the moment  fallen heavily upon a floor of silver i became aware of a distinct  hollow  metallic  and clangorous  yet apparently muffled reverberation.
The Fall of the House of Usher,completely unnerved  i leaped to my feet  but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed.

The Fall of the House of Usher,bending closely over him  i at length drank in the hideous import of his words.
The Fall of the House of Usher,not hear it  yes  i hear it  and have heard it.
The Fall of the House of Usher,long long long many minutes  many hours  many days  have i heard it yet i dared not oh  pity me  miserable wretch that i am  i dared not i dared not speak  we have put her living in the tomb  said i not that my senses were acute  i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i heard them many  many days ago yet i dared not i dared not speak  and now to night ethelred ha  ha  the breaking of the hermit    s door  and the death cry of the dragon  and the clangor of the shield  say  rather  the rending of her coffin  and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison  and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault  oh whither shall i fly  will she not be here anon  is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste  have i not heard her footstep on the stair  do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart  madman   here he sprang furiously to his feet  and shrieked out his syllables  as if in the effort he were giving up his soul  madman  i tell you that she now stands without the door    as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell the huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed  threw slowly back  upon the instant  their ponderous and ebony jaws.

The Fall of the House of Usher,from that chamber  and from that mansion  i fled aghast.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway.
The Fall of the House of Usher,suddenly there shot along the path a wild light  and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued  for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the radiance was that of the full  setting  and blood red moon  which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure  of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building  in a zigzag direction  to the base.
The Fall of the House of Usher,while i gazed  this fissure rapidly widened there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the  house of usher.
Silence - A Fable,  listen to me   said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head.
Silence - A Fable,the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya  by the borders of the river zaire.

Silence - A Fable,for many miles on either side of the river    s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,they sigh one unto the other in that solitude  and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks  and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.
Silence - A Fable,and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water.
Silence - A Fable,and they sigh one unto the other.
Silence - A Fable,but there is a boundary to their realm the boundary of the dark  horrible  lofty forest.
Silence - A Fable,there  like the waves about the hebrides  the low underwood is agitated continually.
Silence - A Fable,but there is no wind throughout the heaven.
Silence - A Fable,and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound.
Silence - A Fable,and from their high summits  one by one  drop everlasting dews.
Silence - A Fable,and at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber.
Silence - A Fable,and overhead  with a rustling and loud noise  the gray clouds rush westwardly forever  until they roll  a cataract  over the fiery wall of the horizon.
Silence - A Fable,but there is no wind throughout the heaven.
Silence - A Fable,and by the shores of the river zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.
Silence - A Fable,it was night  and the rain fell  and falling  it was rain  but  having fallen  it was blood.
Silence - A Fable,and i stood in the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon my head and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.
Silence - A Fable,and  all at once  the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist  and was crimson in color.
Silence - A Fable,and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river  and was lighted by the light of the moon.
Silence - A Fable,and the rock was gray  and ghastly  and tall  and the rock was gray.
Silence - A Fable,upon its front were characters engraven in the stone  and i walked through the morass of water lilies  until i came close unto the shore  that i might read the characters upon the stone.
Silence - A Fable,but i could not decypher them.
Silence - A Fable,and i was going back into the morass  when the moon shone with a fuller red  and i turned and looked again upon the rock  and upon the characters  and the characters were desolation.
Silence - A Fable,and i looked upwards  and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock  and i hid myself among the water lilies that i might discover the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man was tall and stately in form  and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome.
Silence - A Fable,and the outlines of his figure were indistinct but his features were the features of a deity  for the mantle of the night  and of the mist  and of the moon  and of the dew  had left uncovered the features of his face.
Silence - A Fable,and his brow was lofty with thought  and his eye wild with care  and  in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow  and weariness  and disgust with mankind  and a longing after solitude.
Silence - A Fable,and the man sat upon the rock  and leaned his head upon his hand  and looked out upon the desolation.
Silence - A Fable,he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery  and up into the tall primeval trees  and up higher at the rustling heaven  and into the crimson moon.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within shelter of the lilies  and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned  and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,and the man turned his attention from the heaven  and looked out upon the dreary river zaire  and upon the yellow ghastly waters  and upon the pale legions of the water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,and the man listened to the sighs of the water lilies  and to the murmur that came up from among them.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i went down into the recesses of the morass  and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies  and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass.
Silence - A Fable,and the hippopotami heard my call  and came  with the behemoth  unto the foot of the rock  and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult  and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where  before  there had been no wind.
Silence - A Fable,and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest and the rain beat upon the head of the man and the floods of the river came down and the river was tormented into foam and the water lilies shrieked within their beds and the forest crumbled before the wind and the thunder rolled and the lightning fell and the rock rocked to its foundation.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i grew angry and cursed  with the curse of silence  the river  and the lilies  and the wind  and the forest  and the heaven  and the thunder  and the sighs of the water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,and they became accursed  and were still.
Silence - A Fable,and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven and the thunder died away and the lightning did not flash and the clouds hung motionless and the waters sunk to their level and remained and the trees ceased to rock and the water lilies sighed no more and the murmur was heard no longer from among them  nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert.
Silence - A Fable,and i looked upon the characters of the rock  and they were changed  and the characters were silence.
Silence - A Fable,and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man  and his countenance was wan with terror.
Silence - A Fable,and  hurriedly  he raised his head from his hand  and stood forth upon the rock and listened.
Silence - A Fable,but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert  and the characters upon the rock were silence.
Silence - A Fable,and the man shuddered  and turned his face away  and fled afar off  in haste  so that i beheld him no more.
Silence - A Fable,now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi in the iron bound  melancholy volumes of the magi.
Silence - A Fable,therein  i say  are glorious histories of the heaven  and of the earth  and of the mighty sea and of the genii that over ruled the sea  and the earth  and the lofty heaven.
Silence - A Fable,there was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils  and holy  holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around dodona but  as allah liveth  that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb  i hold to be the most wonderful of all  and as the demon made an end of his story  he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed.
Silence - A Fable,and i could not laugh with the demon  and he cursed me because i could not laugh.
Silence - A Fable,and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb  came out therefrom  and lay down at the feet of the demon  and looked at him steadily in the face.

The Masque of the Red Death,it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion  and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad  that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was a voluptuous scene  that masquerade.
The Masque of the Red Death,but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were seven an imperial suite.
The Masque of the Red Death,in many palaces  however  such suites form a long and straight vista  while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand  so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.
The Masque of the Red Death,here the case was very different  as might have been expected from the duke    s love of the bizarre.
The Masque of the Red Death,the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards  and at each turn a novel effect.
The Masque of the Red Death,to the right and left  in the middle of each wall  a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite.
The Masque of the Red Death,these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened.
The Masque of the Red Death,that at the eastern extremity was hung  for example  in blue and vividly blue were its windows.
The Masque of the Red Death,the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries  and here the panes were purple.
The Masque of the Red Death,the third was green throughout  and so were the casements.
The Masque of the Red Death,the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet.
The Masque of the Red Death,the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls  falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in this chamber only  the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.
The Masque of the Red Death,the panes here were scarlet a deep blood color.
The Masque of the Red Death,now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum  amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in the corridors that followed the suite  there stood  opposite to each window  a heavy tripod  bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.
The Masque of the Red Death,and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood tinted panes  was ghastly in the extreme  and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered  that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was in this apartment  also  that there stood against the western wall  a gigantic clock of ebony.
The Masque of the Red Death,its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull  heavy  monotonous clang  and when the minute hand made the circuit of the face  and the hour was to be stricken  there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical  but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that  at each lapse of an hour  the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause  momentarily  in their performance  to hearken to the sound  and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions  and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company  and  while the chimes of the clock yet rang  it was observed that the giddiest grew pale  and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation.
The Masque of the Red Death,but when the echoes had fully ceased  a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly  the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly  and made whispering vows  each to the other  that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion  and then  after the lapse of sixty minutes  which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies   there came yet another chiming of the clock  and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.
The Masque of the Red Death,but  in spite of these things  it was a gay and magnificent revel.
The Masque of the Red Death,the tastes of the duke were peculiar.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had a fine eye for colors and effects.

The Masque of the Red Death,his followers felt that he was not.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had directed  in great part  the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers  upon occasion of this great f  te  and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.
The Masque of the Red Death,be sure they were grotesque.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm much of what has been since seen in  hernani.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was much of the beautiful  much of the wanton  much of the bizarre  something of the terrible  and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.
The Masque of the Red Death,to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked  in fact  a multitude of dreams.
The Masque of the Red Death,and these the dreams writhed in and about  taking hue from the rooms  and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.
The Masque of the Red Death,and  anon  there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.
The Masque of the Red Death,and then  for a moment  all is still  and all is silent save the voice of the clock.
The Masque of the Red Death,the dreams are stiff frozen as they stand.
The Masque of the Red Death,but the echoes of the chime die away they have endured but an instant and a light  half subdued laughter floats after them as they depart.
The Masque of the Red Death,and now again the music swells  and the dreams live  and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever  taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.
The Masque of the Red Death,but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven  there are now none of the maskers who venture  for the night is waning away  and there flows a ruddier light through the blood colored panes  and the blackness of the sable drapery appals  and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet  there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.
The Masque of the Red Death,but these other apartments were densely crowded  and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the revel went whirlingly on  until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.
The Masque of the Red Death,and then the music ceased  as i have told  and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted  and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.
The Masque of the Red Death,but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock  and thus it happened  perhaps  that more of thought crept  with more of time  into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.
The Masque of the Red Death,and thus  too  it happened  perhaps  that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence  there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around  there arose at length from the whole company a buzz  or murmur  expressive of disapprobation and surprise then  finally  of terror  of horror  and of disgust.
The Masque of the Red Death,in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted  it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.
The Masque of the Red Death,in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited  but the figure in question had out heroded herod  and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince    s indefinite decorum.
The Masque of the Red Death,there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.
The Masque of the Red Death,even with the utterly lost  to whom life and death are equally jests  there are matters of which no jest can be made.
The Masque of the Red Death,the whole company  indeed  seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.
The Masque of the Red Death,the figure was tall and gaunt  and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.
The Masque of the Red Death,the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.
The Masque of the Red Death,and yet all this might have been endured  if not approved  by the mad revellers around.
The Masque of the Red Death,but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death.
The Masque of the Red Death,his vesture was dabbled in blood and his broad brow  with all the features of the face  was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.
The Masque of the Red Death,when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image  which with a slow and solemn movement  as if more fully to sustain its role  stalked to and fro among the waltzers  he was seen to be convulsed  in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste  but  in the next  his brow reddened with rage.
The Masque of the Red Death,who dares   he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him  who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery  seize him and unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise  from the battlements    it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words.
The Masque of the Red Death,they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man  and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was in the blue room where stood the prince  with a group of pale courtiers by his side.
The Masque of the Red Death,at first  as he spoke  there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder  who at the moment was also near at hand  and now  with deliberate and stately step  made closer approach to the speaker.
The Masque of the Red Death,but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party  there were found none who put forth hand to seize him  so that  unimpeded  he passed within a yard of the prince    s person  and  while the vast assembly  as if with one impulse  shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls  he made his way uninterruptedly  but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first  through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to the green through the green to the orange through this again to the white and even thence to the violet  ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was then  however  that the prince prospero  maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice  rushed hurriedly through the six chambers  while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.
The Masque of the Red Death,he bore aloft a drawn dagger  and had approached  in rapid impetuosity  to within three or four feet of the retreating figure  when the latter  having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment  turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet  upon which  instantly afterwards  fell prostrate in death the prince prospero.
The Masque of the Red Death,then  summoning the wild courage of despair  a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment  and  seizing the mummer  whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock  gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness  untenanted by any tangible form.
The Masque of the Red Death,and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had come like a thief in the night.
The Masque of the Red Death,and one by one dropped the revellers in the blood bedewed halls of their revel  and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the flames of the tripods expired.
The Masque of the Red Death,and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all.
The Cask of Amontillado, the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could  but when he ventured upon insult  i vowed revenge.
The Cask of Amontillado,you  who so well know the nature of my soul  will not suppose  however  that i gave utterance to a threat.
The Cask of Amontillado,at length i would be avenged  this was a point definitively settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved  precluded the idea of risk.
The Cask of Amontillado,i must not only punish  but punish with impunity.
The Cask of Amontillado,a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.
The Cask of Amontillado,it must be understood  that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will.
The Cask of Amontillado,i continued  as was my wont  to smile in his face  and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.
The Cask of Amontillado,he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.
The Cask of Amontillado,he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.
The Cask of Amontillado,few italians have the true virtuoso spirit.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires.
The Cask of Amontillado,in painting and gemmary  fortunato  like his countrymen  was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.
The Cask of Amontillado,in this respect i did not differ from him materially  i was skilful in the italian vintages myself  and bought largely whenever i could.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was about dusk  one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season  that i encountered my friend.
The Cask of Amontillado,he accosted me with excessive warmth  for he had been drinking much.
The Cask of Amontillado,the man wore motley.
The Cask of Amontillado,he had on a tight fitting parti striped dress  and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.
The Cask of Amontillado,i was so pleased to see him  that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand.
The Cask of Amontillado,i said to him   my dear fortunato  you are luckily met.
The Cask of Amontillado,how remarkably well you are looking to day  but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado  and i have my doubts.
The Cask of Amontillado,how   said he.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado  a pipe  impossible  and in the middle of the carnival     i have my doubts   i replied   and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter.
The Cask of Amontillado,you were not to be found  and i was fearful of losing a bargain.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     i have my doubts.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     and i must satisfy them.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     as you are engaged  i am on my way to luchesi.
The Cask of Amontillado,if any one has a critical turn  it is he.
The Cask of Amontillado,he will tell me     luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry.
The Cask of Amontillado,and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.
The Cask of Amontillado,come  let us go.
The Cask of Amontillado,whither     to your vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,my friend  no  i will not impose upon your good nature.
The Cask of Amontillado,i perceive you have an engagement.
The Cask of Amontillado,luchesi     i have no engagement  come.
The Cask of Amontillado,my friend  no.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is not the engagement  but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted.
The Cask of Amontillado,the vaults are insufferably damp.
The Cask of Amontillado,they are encrusted with nitre.
The Cask of Amontillado,let us go  nevertheless.
The Cask of Amontillado,the cold is merely nothing.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado  you have been imposed upon.
The Cask of Amontillado,and as for luchesi  he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,thus speaking  fortunato possessed himself of my arm.
The Cask of Amontillado,putting on a mask of black silk  and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person  i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
The Cask of Amontillado,there were no attendants at home  they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had told them that i should not return until the morning  and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.
The Cask of Amontillado,these orders were sufficient  i well knew  to insure their immediate disappearance  one and all  as soon as my back was turned.
The Cask of Amontillado,i took from their sconces two flambeaux  and giving one to fortunato  bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,i passed down a long and winding staircase  requesting him to be cautious as he followed.
The Cask of Amontillado,we came at length to the foot of the descent  and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors.
The Cask of Amontillado,the gait of my friend was unsteady  and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.
The Cask of Amontillado,the pipe   said he.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is farther on   said i   but observe the white web work which gleams from these cavern walls.
The Cask of Amontillado,he turned towards me  and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.
The Cask of Amontillado,nitre   he asked  at length.
The Cask of Amontillado,nitre   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,how long have you had that cough     ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh    my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is nothing   he said  at last.
The Cask of Amontillado,come   i said  with decision   we will go back  your health is precious.
The Cask of Amontillado,you are rich  respected  admired  beloved  you are happy  as once i was.
The Cask of Amontillado,you are a man to be missed.
The Cask of Amontillado,for me it is no matter.
The Cask of Amontillado,we will go back  you will be ill  and i cannot be responsible.
The Cask of Amontillado,besides  there is luchesi     enough   he said   the cough is a mere nothing  it will not kill me.
The Cask of Amontillado,i shall not die of a cough.
The Cask of Amontillado,true true   i replied   and  indeed  i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution.
The Cask of Amontillado,a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps.
The Cask of Amontillado,here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.
The Cask of Amontillado,drink   i said  presenting him the wine.
The Cask of Amontillado,he raised it to his lips with a leer.
The Cask of Amontillado,he paused and nodded to me familiarly  while his bells jingled.
The Cask of Amontillado,i drink   he said   to the buried that repose around us.
The Cask of Amontillado,and i to your long life.
The Cask of Amontillado,he again took my arm  and we proceeded.
The Cask of Amontillado,these vaults   he said   are extensive.
The Cask of Amontillado,the montresors   i replied   were a great and numerous family.
The Cask of Amontillado,i forget your arms.
The Cask of Amontillado,a huge human foot d    or  in a field azure  the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.
The Cask of Amontillado,and the motto     nemo me impune lacessit.
The Cask of Amontillado,good   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.
The Cask of Amontillado,my own fancy grew warm with the medoc.
The Cask of Amontillado,we had passed through walls of piled bones  with casks and puncheons intermingling  into the inmost recesses of the catacombs.
The Cask of Amontillado,i paused again  and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow.
The Cask of Amontillado,the nitre   i said   see  it increases.
The Cask of Amontillado,it hangs like moss upon the vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,we are below the river    s bed.
The Cask of Amontillado,the drops of moisture trickle among the bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,come  we will go back ere it is too late.
The Cask of Amontillado,your cough     it is nothing   he said   let us go on.
The Cask of Amontillado,but first  another draught of the medoc.
The Cask of Amontillado,i broke and reached him a flagon of de gr  ve.
The Cask of Amontillado,he emptied it at a breath.
The Cask of Amontillado,his eyes flashed with a fierce light.
The Cask of Amontillado,he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand.
The Cask of Amontillado,i looked at him in surprise.
The Cask of Amontillado,he repeated the movement a grotesque one.
The Cask of Amontillado,you do not comprehend   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,not i   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,then you are not of the brotherhood.
The Cask of Amontillado,how     you are not of the masons.
The Cask of Amontillado,yes  yes   i said   yes  yes.
The Cask of Amontillado,you  impossible  a mason     a mason   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,a sign   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is this   i answered  producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire.
The Cask of Amontillado,you jest   he exclaimed  recoiling a few paces.
The Cask of Amontillado,but let us proceed to the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,be it so   i said  replacing the tool beneath the cloak  and again offering him my arm.
The Cask of Amontillado,he leaned upon it heavily.
The Cask of Amontillado,we continued our route in search of the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,we passed through a range of low arches  descended  passed on  and descending again  arrived at a deep crypt  in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.
The Cask of Amontillado,at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.
The Cask of Amontillado,its walls had been lined with human remains  piled to the vault overhead  in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris.
The Cask of Amontillado,three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.
The Cask of Amontillado,from the fourth the bones had been thrown down  and lay promiscuously upon the earth  forming at one point a mound of some size.
The Cask of Amontillado,within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones  we perceived a still interior recess  in depth about four feet  in width three  in height six or seven.
The Cask of Amontillado,it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself  but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs  and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was in vain that fortunato  uplifting his dull torch  endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.
The Cask of Amontillado,proceed   i said   herein is the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,as for luchesi     he is an ignoramus   interrupted my friend  as he stepped unsteadily forward  while i followed immediately at his heels.
The Cask of Amontillado,in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche  and finding his progress arrested by the rock  stood stupidly bewildered.
The Cask of Amontillado,a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite.
The Cask of Amontillado,in its surface were two iron staples  distant from each other about two feet  horizontally.
The Cask of Amontillado,from one of these depended a short chain  from the other a padlock.
The Cask of Amontillado,throwing the links about his waist  it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.
The Cask of Amontillado,he was too much astounded to resist.
The Cask of Amontillado,withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,pass your hand   i said   over the wall  you cannot help feeling the nitre.
The Cask of Amontillado,indeed it is very damp.
The Cask of Amontillado,once more let me implore you to return.
The Cask of Amontillado,no  then i must positively leave you.
The Cask of Amontillado,but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power.
The Cask of Amontillado,the amontillado   ejaculated my friend  not yet recovered from his astonishment.
The Cask of Amontillado,true   i replied   the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken.
The Cask of Amontillado,throwing them aside  i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.
The Cask of Amontillado,with these materials and with the aid of my trowel  i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off.
The Cask of Amontillado,the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was not the cry of a drunken man.
The Cask of Amontillado,there was then a long and obstinate silence.
The Cask of Amontillado,i laid the second tier  and the third  and the fourth  and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain.
The Cask of Amontillado,the noise lasted for several minutes  during which  that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction  i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,when at last the clanking subsided  i resumed the trowel  and finished without interruption the fifth  the sixth  and the seventh tier.
The Cask of Amontillado,the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.
The Cask of Amontillado,i again paused  and holding the flambeaux over the mason work  threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.
The Cask of Amontillado,a succession of loud and shrill screams  bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form  seemed to thrust me violently back.
The Cask of Amontillado,for a brief moment i hesitated i trembled.
The Cask of Amontillado,unsheathing my rapier  i began to grope with it about the recess  but the thought of an instant reassured me.
The Cask of Amontillado,i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs  and felt satisfied.
The Cask of Amontillado,i reapproached the wall.
The Cask of Amontillado,i replied to the yells of him who clamored.
The Cask of Amontillado,i re echoed i aided i surpassed them in volume and in strength.
The Cask of Amontillado,i did this  and the clamorer grew still.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was now midnight  and my task was drawing to a close.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had completed the eighth  the ninth  and the tenth tier.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh  there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.
The Cask of Amontillado,i struggled with its weight  i placed it partially in its destined position.
The Cask of Amontillado,but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was succeeded by a sad voice  which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato.
The Cask of Amontillado,the voice said    ha  ha  ha  he  he  a very good joke indeed an excellent jest.
The Cask of Amontillado,we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo he  he  he  over our wine he  he  he     the amontillado   i said.
The Cask of Amontillado,he  he  he  he  he  he  yes  the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,but is it not getting late  will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo  the lady fortunato and the rest  let us be gone.
The Cask of Amontillado,yes   i said   let us be gone.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the love of god  montressor     yes   i said   for the love of god    but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply.
The Cask of Amontillado,i grew impatient.
The Cask of Amontillado,i called aloud    fortunato    no answer.
The Cask of Amontillado,i called again    fortunato    no answer still.
The Cask of Amontillado,i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within.
The Cask of Amontillado,there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.
The Cask of Amontillado,my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.
The Cask of Amontillado,i hastened to make an end of my labor.
The Cask of Amontillado,i forced the last stone into its position  i plastered it up.
The Cask of Amontillado,against the new masonry i re erected the old rampart of bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.
The Cask of Amontillado,in pace requiescat
The Island of the Way,  la musique   says marmontel  in those  contes moraux       which in all our translations  we have insisted upon calling  moral tales   as if in mockery of their spirit  la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui m  me  tous les autres veulent des temoins.
The Island of the Way,he here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.
The Island of the Way,no more than any other talent  is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment  where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise.
The Island of the Way,and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude.
The Island of the Way,the idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly  or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point  is  doubtless  the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone.
The Island of the Way,the proposition  in this form  will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake  and for its spiritual uses.
The Island of the Way,but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion.
The Island of the Way,i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery.
The Island of the Way,in truth  the man who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude behold that glory.
The Island of the Way,to me  at least  the presence not of human life only  but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless is a stain upon the landscape is at war with the genius of the scene.
The Island of the Way,i love  indeed  to regard the dark valleys  and the gray rocks  and the waters that silently smile  and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers  and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all  i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole a whole whose form  that of the sphere  is the most perfect and most inclusive of all  whose path is among associate planets  whose meek handmaiden is the moon  whose mediate sovereign is the sun  whose life is eternity  whose thought is that of a god  whose enjoyment is knowledge  whose destinies are lost in immensity  whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain a being which we  in consequence  regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.
The Island of the Way,our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood that space  and therefore that bulk  is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty.
The Island of the Way,the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution  without collision  of the greatest possible number of bodies.
The Island of the Way,the forms of those bodies are accurately such as  within a given surface  to include the greatest possible amount of matter  while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.
The Island of the Way,nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god  that space itself is infinite  for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it.
The Island of the Way,and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle indeed  as far as our judgments extend  the leading principle in the operations of deity  it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute  where we daily trace it  and not extending to those of the august.
The Island of the Way,as we find cycle within cycle without end  yet all revolving around one far distant centre which is the god head  may we not analogically suppose in the same manner  life within life  the less within the greater  and all within the spirit divine  in short  we are madly erring  through self esteem  in believing man  in either his temporal or future destinies  to be of more moment in the universe than that vast  clod of the valley  which he tills and contemns  and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.
The Island of the Way,these fancies  and such as these  have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests  by the rivers and the ocean  a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic.
The Island of the Way,my wanderings amid such scenes have been many  and far searching  and often solitary  and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim  deep valley  or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake  has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed alone.
The Island of the Way,what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion to the well known work of zimmerman  that   la solitude est une belle chose  mais il faut quelqu    un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose   the epigram cannot be gainsayed  but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.
The Island of the Way,it was during one of my lonely journeyings  amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain  and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island.
The Island of the Way,i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june  and threw myself upon the turf  beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub  that i might doze as i contemplated the scene.
The Island of the Way,i felt that thus only should i look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore.
The Island of the Way,on all sides save to the west  where the sun was about sinking arose the verdant walls of the forest.
The Island of the Way,the little river which turned sharply in its course  and was thus immediately lost to sight  seemed to have no exit from its prison  but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter  so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward  there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley  a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.
The Island of the Way,about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in  one small circular island  profusely verdured  reposed upon the bosom of the stream.
The Island of the Way,so blended bank and shadow there that each seemed pendulous in air   so mirror like was the glassy water  that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began.
The Island of the Way,my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet  and i observed a singularly marked difference in their aspects.
The Island of the Way,the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties.
The Island of the Way,it glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight  and fairly laughed with flowers.
The Island of the Way,the grass was short  springy  sweet scented  and asphodel interspersed.
The Island of the Way,the trees were lithe  mirthful  erect bright  slender  and graceful  of eastern figure and foliage  with bark smooth  glossy  and parti colored.
The Island of the Way,there seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all  and although no airs blew from out the heavens  yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies  that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.
The Island of the Way,the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.
The Island of the Way,a sombre  yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.
The Island of the Way,the trees were dark in color  and mournful in form and attitude  wreathing themselves into sad  solemn  and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.
The Island of the Way,the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress  and the heads of its blades hung droopingly  and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks  low and narrow  and not very long  that had the aspect of graves  but were not  although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.
The Island of the Way,the shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water  and seemed to bury itself therein  impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.
The Island of the Way,i fancied that each shadow  as the sun descended lower and lower  separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth  and thus became absorbed by the stream  while other shadows issued momently from the trees  taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.
The Island of the Way,this idea  having once seized upon my fancy  greatly excited it  and i lost myself forthwith in revery.
The Island of the Way,if ever island were enchanted   said i to myself   this is it.
The Island of the Way,this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck of the race.
The Island of the Way,are these green tombs theirs  or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own  in dying  do they not rather waste away mournfully  rendering unto god  little by little  their existence  as these trees render up shadow after shadow  exhausting their substance unto dissolution  what the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade  growing thus blacker by what it preys upon  may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it    as i thus mused  with half shut eyes  while the sun sank rapidly to rest  and eddying currents careered round and round the island  bearing upon their bosom large  dazzling  white flakes of the bark of the sycamore flakes which  in their multiform positions upon the water  a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i thus mused  it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays about whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.
The Island of the Way,she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe  and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.
The Island of the Way,while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams  her attitude seemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade.
The Island of the Way,slowly she glided along  and at length rounded the islet and re entered the region of light.
The Island of the Way,the revolution which has just been made by the fay   continued i  musingly   is the cycle of the brief year of her life.
The Island of the Way,she has floated through her winter and through her summer.
The Island of the Way,she is a year nearer unto death  for i did not fail to see that  as she came into the shade  her shadow fell from her  and was swallowed up in the dark water  making its blackness more black.
The Island of the Way,and again the boat appeared and the fay  but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.
The Island of the Way,she floated again from out the light and into the gloom  which deepened momently  and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water  and became absorbed into its blackness.
The Island of the Way,and again and again she made the circuit of the island   while the sun rushed down to his slumbers   and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person  while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct  and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade  which became whelmed in a shadow more black.
The Island of the Way,but at length when the sun had utterly departed  the fay  now the mere ghost of her former self  went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and that she issued thence at all i cannot say  for darkness fell over all things and i beheld her magical figure no more.
The Assignation, ill fated and mysterious man  bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination  and fallen in the flames of thine own youth  again in fancy i behold thee  once more thy form hath risen before me  not oh  not as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions  thine own venice which is a star beloved elysium of the sea  and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters.
The Assignation,yes  i repeat it as thou shouldst be.
The Assignation,there are surely other worlds than this other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude other speculations than the speculations of the sophist.
The Assignation,who then shall call thy conduct into question  who blame thee for thy visionary hours  or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life  which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies   it was at venice  beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di sospiri  that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom i speak.
The Assignation,it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting.
The Assignation,yet i remember ah  how should i forget  the deep midnight  the bridge of sighs  the beauty of woman  and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.
The Assignation,it was a night of unusual gloom.
The Assignation,the great clock of the piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening.
The Assignation,the square of the campanile lay silent and deserted  and the lights in the old ducal palace were dying fast away.
The Assignation,i was returning home from the piazetta  by way of the grand canal.
The Assignation,but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal san marco  a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night  in one wild  hysterical  and long continued shriek.
The Assignation,startled at the sound  i sprang upon my feet  while the gondolier  letting slip his single oar  lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery  and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.
The Assignation,like some huge and sable feathered condor  we were slowly drifting down towards the bridge of sighs  when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows  and down the staircases of the ducal palace  turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.
The Assignation,a child  slipping from the arms of its own mother  had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal.
The Assignation,the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim  and  although my own gondola was the only one in sight  many a stout swimmer  already in the stream  was seeking in vain upon the surface  the treasure which was to be found  alas  only within the abyss.
The Assignation,upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace  and a few steps above the water  stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten.
The Assignation,it was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration of all venice the gayest of the gay the most lovely where all were beautiful but still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni  and the mother of that fair child  her first and only one  who now  deep beneath the murky water  was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses  and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name.
The Assignation,she stood alone.
The Assignation,her small  bare  and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of marble beneath her.
The Assignation,her hair  not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ball room array  clustered  amid a shower of diamonds  round and round her classical head  in curls like those of the young hyacinth.
The Assignation,a snowy white and gauze like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form  but the mid summer and midnight air was hot  sullen  and still  and no motion in the statue like form itself  stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe.
The Assignation,yet strange to say  her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted in a widely different direction  the prison of the old republic is  i think  the stateliest building in all venice but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it  when beneath her lay stifling her only child  yon dark  gloomy niche  too  yawns right opposite her chamber window what  then  could there be in its shadows in its architecture in its ivy wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa di mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before  nonsense  who does not remember that  at such a time as this  the eye  like a shattered mirror  multiplies the images of its sorrow  and sees in innumerable far off places  the woe which is close at hand   many steps above the marchesa  and within the arch of the water gate  stood  in full dress  the satyr like figure of mentoni himself.
The Assignation,he was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar  and seemed ennuye to the very death  as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his child.
The Assignation,stupefied and aghast  i had myself no power to move from the upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek  and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance  as with pale countenance and rigid limbs  i floated down among them in that funereal gondola.
The Assignation,all efforts proved in vain.
The Assignation,many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing their exertions  and yielding to a gloomy sorrow.
The Assignation,there seemed but little hope for the child   how much less than for the mother   but now  from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison  and as fronting the lattice of the marchesa  a figure muffled in a cloak  stepped out within reach of the light  and  pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy descent  plunged headlong into the canal.
The Assignation,as  in an instant afterwards  he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp  upon the marble flagstones by the side of the marchesa  his cloak  heavy with the drenching water  became unfastened  and  falling in folds about his feet  discovered to the wonder stricken spectators the graceful person of a very young man  with the sound of whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing.
The Assignation,no word spoke the deliverer.
The Assignation,but the marchesa  she will now receive her child she will press it to her heart she will cling to its little form  and smother it with her caresses.
The Assignation,alas  another    s arms have taken it from the stranger another    s arms have taken it away  and borne it afar off  unnoticed  into the palace  and the marchesa  her lip her beautiful lip trembles  tears are gathering in her eyes those eyes which  like pliny    s acanthus  are  soft and almost liquid.
The Assignation,yes  tears are gathering in those eyes and see  the entire woman thrills throughout the soul  and the statue has started into life  the pallor of the marble countenance  the swelling of the marble bosom  the very purity of the marble feet  we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson  and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame  as a gentle air at napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass.
The Assignation,why should that lady blush  to this demand there is no answer except that  having left  in the eager haste and terror of a mother    s heart  the privacy of her own boudoir  she has neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers  and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due.
The Assignation,what other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing  for the glance of those wild appealing eyes  for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom  for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand  that hand which fell  as mentoni turned into the palace  accidentally  upon the hand of the stranger.
The Assignation,what reason could there have been for the low the singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu   thou hast conquered   she said  or the murmurs of the water deceived me   thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise we shall meet so let it be    the tumult had subsided  the lights had died away within the palace  and the stranger  whom i now recognized  stood alone upon the flags.
The Assignation,he shook with inconceivable agitation  and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola.
The Assignation,i could not do less than offer him the service of my own  and he accepted the civility.
The Assignation,having obtained an oar at the water gate  we proceeded together to his residence  while he rapidly recovered his self possession  and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality.
The Assignation,there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being minute.
The Assignation,the person of the stranger let me call him by this title  who to all the world was still a stranger the person of the stranger is one of these subjects.
The Assignation,in height he might have been below rather than above the medium size  although there were moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and belied the assertion.
The Assignation,the light  almost slender symmetry of his figure  promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at the bridge of sighs  than of that herculean strength which he has been known to wield without an effort  upon occasions of more dangerous emergency.
The Assignation,with the mouth and chin of a deity singular  wild  full  liquid eyes  whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jet and a profusion of curling  black hair  from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivory his were features than which i have seen none more classically regular  except  perhaps  the marble ones of the emperor commodus.
The Assignation,yet his countenance was  nevertheless  one of those which all men have seen at some period of their lives  and have never afterwards seen again.
The Assignation,it had no peculiar  it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory  a countenance seen and instantly forgotten  but forgotten with a vague and never ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.
The Assignation,not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed  at any time  to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face but that the mirror  mirror like  retained no vestige of the passion  when the passion had departed.
The Assignation,upon leaving him on the night of our adventure  he solicited me  in what i thought an urgent manner  to call upon him very early the next morning.
The Assignation,shortly after sunrise  i found myself accordingly at his palazzo  one of those huge structures of gloomy  yet fantastic pomp  which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the rialto.
The Assignation,i was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics  into an apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare  making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.
The Assignation,i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy.
The Assignation,report had spoken of his possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous exaggeration.
The Assignation,but as i gazed about me  i could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.
The Assignation,although  as i say  the sun had arisen  yet the room was still brilliantly lighted up.
The Assignation,i judge from this circumstance  as well as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend  that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night.
The Assignation,in the architecture and embellishments of the chamber  the evident design had been to dazzle and astound.
The Assignation,little attention had been paid to the decora of what is technically called keeping  or to the proprieties of nationality.
The Assignation,the eye wandered from object to object  and rested upon none neither the grotesques of the greek painters  nor the sculptures of the best italian days  nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt.
The Assignation,rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low  melancholy music  whose origin was not to be discovered.
The Assignation,the senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes  reeking up from strange convolute censers  together with multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire.
The Assignation,the rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole  through windows  formed each of a single pane of crimson tinted glass.
The Assignation,glancing to and fro  in a thousand reflections  from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver  the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the artificial light  and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich  liquid looking cloth of chili gold.
The Assignation,ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  ha   laughed the proprietor  motioning me to a seat as i entered the room  and throwing himself back at full length upon an ottoman.
The Assignation,i see   said he  perceiving that i could not immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a welcome  i see you are astonished at my apartment at my statues my pictures my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery  absolutely drunk  eh  with my magnificence  but pardon me  my dear sir   here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality   pardon me for my uncharitable laughter.
The Assignation,you appeared so utterly astonished.
The Assignation,besides  some things are so completely ludicrous  that a man must laugh or die.
The Assignation,to die laughing  must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths  sir thomas more a very fine man was sir thomas more sir thomas more died laughing  you remember.
The Assignation,also in the absurdities of ravisius textor  there is a long list of characters who came to the same magnificent end.
The Assignation,do you know  however   continued he musingly   that at sparta  which is now pal  ochori   at sparta  i say  to the west of the citadel  among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins  is a kind of socle  upon which are still legible the letters         .
The Assignation,they are undoubtedly part of               .
The Assignation,now  at sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities.
The Assignation,how exceedingly strange that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others  but in the present instance   he resumed  with a singular alteration of voice and manner   i have no right to be merry at your expense.
The Assignation,you might well have been amazed.
The Assignation,europe cannot produce anything so fine as this  my little regal cabinet.
The Assignation,my other apartments are by no means of the same order mere ultras of fashionable insipidity.
The Assignation,this is better than fashion is it not  yet this has but to be seen to become the rage that is  with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.
The Assignation,i have guarded  however  against any such profanation.
The Assignation,with one exception  you are the only human being besides myself and my valet  who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts  since they have been bedizened as you see    i bowed in acknowledgment for the overpowering sense of splendor and perfume  and music  together with the unexpected eccentricity of his address and manner  prevented me from expressing  in words  my appreciation of what i might have construed into a compliment.
The Assignation,here   he resumed  arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around the apartment   here are paintings from the greeks to cimabue  and from cimabue to the present hour.
The Assignation,many are chosen  as you see  with little deference to the opinions of virtu.
The Assignation,they are all  however  fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this.
The Assignation,here  too  are some chefs d    oeuvre of the unknown great  and here  unfinished designs by men  celebrated in their day  whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence and to me.
The Assignation,what think you   said he  turning abruptly as he spoke  what think you of this madonna della pieta     it is guido    s own   i said  with all the enthusiasm of my nature  for i had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness.
The Assignation,it is guido    s own  how could you have obtained it  she is undoubtedly in painting what the venus is in sculpture.
The Assignation,ha   said he thoughtfully   the venus the beautiful venus  the venus of the medici  she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair  part of the left arm  here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty   and all the right  are restorations  and in the coquetry of that right arm lies  i think  the quintessence of all affectation.
The Assignation,give me the canova  the apollo  too  is a copy there can be no doubt of it blind fool that i am  who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo  i cannot help pity me  i cannot help preferring the antinous.
The Assignation,was it not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of marble  then michael angelo was by no means original in his couplet       non ha l    ottimo artista alcun concetto che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.
The Assignation,it has been  or should be remarked  that  in the manner of the true gentleman  we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the vulgar  without being at once precisely able to determine in what such difference consists.
The Assignation,allowing the remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance  i felt it  on that eventful morning  still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and character.
The Assignation,nor can i better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings  than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought  pervading even his most trivial actions intruding upon his moments of dalliance and interweaving itself with his very flashes of merriment like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis.
The Assignation,i could not help  however  repeatedly observing  through the mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of little importance  a certain air of trepidation a degree of nervous unction in action and in speech an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable  and upon some occasions even filled me with alarm.
The Assignation,frequently  too  pausing in the middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten  he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention  as if either in momentary expectation of a visitor  or to sounds which must have had existence in his imagination alone.
The Assignation,it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction  that  in turning over a page of the poet and scholar politian    s beautiful tragedy  the orfeo    the first native italian tragedy   which lay near me upon an ottoman  i discovered a passage underlined in pencil.
The Assignation,it was a passage towards the end of the third act a passage of the most heart stirring excitement a passage which  although tainted with impurity  no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion no woman without a sigh.
The Assignation,the whole page was blotted with fresh tears  and  upon the opposite interleaf  were the following english lines  written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance  that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his own    thou wast that all to me  love      for which my soul did pine  a green isle in the sea  love      a fountain and a shrine  all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers      and all the flowers were mine.
The Assignation,ah  dream too bright to last      ah  starry hope  that didst arise but to be overcast      a voice from out the future cries   onward   but o    er the past      dim gulf   my spirit hovering lies  mute motionless aghast   for alas  alas  with me     the light of life is o    er.
The Assignation,no more no more no more        such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore       shall bloom the thunder blasted tree  or the stricken eagle soar   now all my hours are trances      and all my nightly dreams are where the dark eye glances      and where thy footstep gleams  in what ethereal dances      by what italian streams.
The Assignation,alas  for that accursed time     they bore thee o    er the billow  from love to titled age and crime      and an unholy pillow   from me  and from our misty clime      where weeps the silver willow   that these lines were written in english a language with which i had not believed their author acquainted afforded me little matter for surprise.
The Assignation,i was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements  and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation  to be astonished at any similar discovery  but the place of date  i must confess  occasioned me no little amazement.
The Assignation,it had been originally written london  and afterwards carefully overscored not  however  so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye.
The Assignation,i say  this occasioned me no little amazement  for i well remember that  in a former conversation with a friend  i particularly inquired if he had at any time met in london the marchesa di mentoni   who for some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city   when his answer  if i mistake not  gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of great britain.
The Assignation,i might as well here mention  that i have more than once heard   without  of course  giving credit to a report involving so many improbabilities   that the person of whom i speak  was not only by birth  but in education  an englishman.
The Assignation,there is one painting   said he  without being aware of my notice of the tragedy  there is still one painting which you have not seen.
The Assignation,and throwing aside a drapery  he discovered a full length portrait of the marchesa aphrodite.
The Assignation,human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty.
The Assignation,the same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace  stood before me once again.
The Assignation,but in the expression of the countenance  which was beaming all over with smiles  there still lurked  incomprehensible anomaly   that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful.
The Assignation,her right arm lay folded over her bosom.
The Assignation,with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.
The Assignation,one small  fairy foot  alone visible  barely touched the earth  and  scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness  floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings.
The Assignation,my glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend  and the vigorous words of chapman    s bussy d    ambois  quivered instinctively upon my lips        he is up there like a roman statue  he will stand till death hath made him marble     come   he said at length  turning towards a table of richly enamelled and massive silver  upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained  together with two large etruscan vases  fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait  and filled with what i supposed to be johannisberger.
The Assignation,come   he said  abruptly   let us drink  it is early but let us drink.
The Assignation,it is indeed early   he continued  musingly  as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise   it is indeed early but what matters it  let us drink  let us pour out an offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to subdue   and  having made me pledge him in a bumper  he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.
The Assignation,to dream   he continued  resuming the tone of his desultory conversation  as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vases  to dream has been the business of my life.
The Assignation,i have therefore framed for myself  as you see  a bower of dreams.
The Assignation,in the heart of venice could i have erected a better  you behold around you  it is true  a medley of architectural embellishments.
The Assignation,the chastity of ionia is offended by antediluvian devices  and the sphynxes of egypt are outstretched upon carpets of gold.
The Assignation,yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.
The Assignation,proprieties of place  and especially of time  are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.
The Assignation,once i was myself a decorist  but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul.
The Assignation,all this is now the fitter for my purpose.
The Assignation,like these arabesque censers  my spirit is writhing in fire  and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither i am now rapidly departing.
The Assignation,he here paused abruptly  bent his head to his bosom  and seemed to listen to a sound which i could not hear.
The Assignation,at length  erecting his frame  he looked upwards  and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of chichester    stay for me there  i will not fail to meet thee in that hollow vale.
The Assignation,in the next instant  confessing the power of the wine  he threw himself at full length upon an ottoman.
The Assignation,a quick step was now heard upon the staircase  and a loud knock at the door rapidly succeeded.
The Assignation,i was hastening to anticipate a second disturbance  when a page of mentoni    s household burst into the room  and faltered out  in a voice choking with emotion  the incoherent words   my mistress  my mistress  poisoned  poisoned  oh  beautiful oh  beautiful aphrodite    bewildered  i flew to the ottoman  and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence.
The Assignation,but his limbs were rigid his lips were livid his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death.
The Assignation,i staggered back towards the table my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.
The Pit and the Pendulum, i was sick sick unto death with that long agony  and when they at length unbound me  and i was permitted to sit  i felt that my senses were leaving me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sentence the dread sentence of death was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears.
The Pit and the Pendulum,after that  the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this only for a brief period  for presently i heard no more.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet  for a while  i saw but with how terrible an exaggeration  i saw the lips of the black robed judges.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they appeared to me white whiter than the sheet upon which i trace these words and thin even to grotesqueness  thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness of immoveable resolution of stern contempt of human torture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that the decrees of what to me was fate  were still issuing from those lips.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw them writhe with a deadly locution.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw them fashion the syllables of my name  and i shuddered because no sound succeeded.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw  too  for a few moments of delirious horror  the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first they wore the aspect of charity  and seemed white and slender angels who would save me  but then  all at once  there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit  and i felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery  while the angel forms became meaningless spectres  with heads of flame  and i saw that from them there would be no help.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then there stole into my fancy  like a rich musical note  the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the thought came gently and stealthily  and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation  but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it  the figures of the judges vanished  as if magically  from before me  the tall candles sank into nothingness  their flames went out utterly  the blackness of darkness supervened  all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then silence  and stillness  night were the universe.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had swooned  but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what of it there remained i will not attempt to define  or even to describe  yet all was not lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the deepest slumber no  in delirium no  in a swoon no  in death no  even in the grave all is not lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,else there is no immortality for man.
The Pit and the Pendulum,arousing from the most profound of slumbers  we break the gossamer web of some dream.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet in a second afterward   so frail may that web have been  we remember not that we have dreamed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the return to life from the swoon there are two stages  first  that of the sense of mental or spiritual  secondly  that of the sense of physical  existence.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it seems probable that if  upon reaching the second stage  we could recall the impressions of the first  we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and that gulf is what  how at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb  but if the impressions of what i have termed the first stage are not  at will  recalled  yet  after long interval  do they not come unbidden  while we marvel whence they come  he who has never swooned  is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow  is not he who beholds floating in mid air the sad visions that the many may not view  is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower  is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember  amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed  there have been moments when i have dreamed of success  there have been brief  very brief periods when i have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,these shadows of memory tell  indistinctly  of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down down still down till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they tell also of a vague horror at my heart  on account of that heart    s unnatural stillness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things  as if those who bore me  a ghastly train   had outrun  in their descent  the limits of the limitless  and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.
The Pit and the Pendulum,after this i call to mind flatness and dampness  and then all is madness the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.
The Pit and the Pendulum,very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound the tumultuous motion of the heart  and  in my ears  the sound of its beating.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a pause in which all is blank.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then again sound  and motion  and touch a tingling sensation pervading my frame.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then the mere consciousness of existence  without thought a condition which lasted long.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then  very suddenly  thought  and shuddering terror  and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and now a full memory of the trial  of the judges  of the sable draperies  of the sentence  of the sickness  of the swoon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then entire forgetfulness of all that followed  of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,so far  i had not opened my eyes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt that i lay upon my back  unbound.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i reached out my hand  and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there i suffered it to remain for many minutes  while i strove to imagine where and what i could be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i longed  yet dared not to employ my vision.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dreaded the first glance at objects around me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was not that i feared to look upon things horrible  but that i grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length  with a wild desperation at heart  i quickly unclosed my eyes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my worst thoughts  then  were confirmed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the blackness of eternal night encompassed me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i struggled for breath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the atmosphere was intolerably close.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i still lay quietly  and made effort to exercise my reason.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings  and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sentence had passed  and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead.
The Pit and the Pendulum,such a supposition  notwithstanding what we read in fiction  is altogether inconsistent with real existence  but where and in what state was i  the condemned to death  i knew  perished usually at the autos da fe  and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial.
The Pit and the Pendulum,had i been remanded to my dungeon  to await the next sacrifice  which would not take place for many months  this i at once saw could not be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,victims had been in immediate demand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,moreover  my dungeon  as well as all the condemned cells at toledo  had stone floors  and light was not altogether excluded.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart  and for a brief period  i once more relapsed into insensibility.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon recovering  i at once started to my feet  trembling convulsively in every fibre.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt nothing  yet dreaded to move a step  lest i should be impeded by the walls of a tomb.
The Pit and the Pendulum,perspiration burst from every pore  and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the agony of suspense grew at length intolerable  and i cautiously moved forward  with my arms extended  and my eyes straining from their sockets  in the hope of catching some faint ray of light.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i proceeded for many paces  but still all was blackness and vacancy.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i breathed more freely.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it seemed evident that mine was not  at least  the most hideous of fates.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and now  as i still continued to step cautiously onward  there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of toledo.
The Pit and the Pendulum,of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated fables i had always deemed them but yet strange  and too ghastly to repeat  save in a whisper.
The Pit and the Pendulum,was i left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness  or what fate  perhaps even more fearful  awaited me  that the result would be death  and a death of more than customary bitterness  i knew too well the character of my judges to doubt.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was a wall  seemingly of stone masonry very smooth  slimy  and cold.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i followed it up  stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this process  however  afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon  as i might make its circuit  and return to the point whence i set out  without being aware of the fact  so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket  when led into the inquisitorial chamber  but it was gone  my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry  so as to identify my point of departure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the difficulty  nevertheless  was but trivial  although  in the disorder of my fancy  it seemed at first insuperable.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length  and at right angles to the wall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in groping my way around the prison  i could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit.
The Pit and the Pendulum,so  at least i thought  but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon  or upon my own weakness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the ground was moist and slippery.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i staggered onward for some time  when i stumbled and fell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate  and sleep soon overtook me as i lay.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon awaking  and stretching forth an arm  i found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance  but ate and drank with avidity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,shortly afterward  i resumed my tour around the prison  and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,up to the period when i fell i had counted fifty two paces  and upon resuming my walk  i had counted forty eight more when i arrived at the rag.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there were in all  then  a hundred paces  and  admitting two paces to the yard  i presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had met  however  with many angles in the wall  and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault  for vault i could not help supposing it to be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had little object certainly no hope in these researches  but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them.
The Pit and the Pendulum,quitting the wall  i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first i proceeded with extreme caution  for the floor  although seemingly of solid material  was treacherous with slime.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length  however  i took courage  and did not hesitate to step firmly  endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner  when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i stepped on it  and fell violently on my face.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the confusion attending my fall  i did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance  which yet  in a few seconds afterward  and while i still lay prostrate  arrested my attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was this  my chin rested upon the floor of the prison  but my lips and the upper portion of my head  although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin  touched nothing.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor  and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i put forward my arm  and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit  whose extent  of course  i had no means of ascertaining at the moment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,groping about the masonry just below the margin  i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment  and let it fall into the abyss.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent  at length there was a sullen plunge into water  succeeded by loud echoes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening  and as rapid closing of a door overhead  while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom  and as suddenly faded away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me  and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped.
The Pit and the Pendulum,another step before my fall  and the world had seen me no more.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and the death just avoided  was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to the victims of its tyranny  there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies  or death with its most hideous moral horrors.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had been reserved for the latter.
The Pit and the Pendulum,by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung  until i trembled at the sound of my own voice  and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,shaking in every limb  i groped my way back to the wall resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells  of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses  but now i was the veriest of cowards.
The Pit and the Pendulum,neither could i forget what i had read of these pits that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.
The Pit and the Pendulum,agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours  but at length i again slumbered.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon arousing  i found by my side  as before  a loaf and a pitcher of water.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a burning thirst consumed me  and i emptied the vessel at a draught.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it must have been drugged for scarcely had i drunk  before i became irresistibly drowsy.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a deep sleep fell upon me a sleep like that of death.
The Pit and the Pendulum,how long it lasted of course  i know not  but when  once again  i unclosed my eyes  the objects around me were visible.
The Pit and the Pendulum,by a wild sulphurous lustre  the origin of which i could not at first determine  i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in its size i had been greatly mistaken.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty five yards.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble  vain indeed  for what could be of less importance  under the terrible circumstances which environed me  then the mere dimensions of my dungeon  but my soul took a wild interest in trifles  and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my measurement.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the truth at length flashed upon me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in my first attempt at exploration i had counted fifty two paces  up to the period when i fell  i must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge  in fact  i had nearly performed the circuit of the vault.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i then slept and  upon awaking  i must have returned upon my steps thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my confusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left  and ended it with the wall to the right.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had been deceived  too  in respect to the shape of the enclosure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in feeling my way i had found many angles  and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity  so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep  the angles were simply those of a few slight depressions  or niches  at odd intervals.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the general shape of the prison was square.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron  or some other metal  in huge plates  whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the figures of fiends in aspects of menace  with skeleton forms  and other more really fearful images  overspread and disfigured the walls.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct  but that the colors seemed faded and blurred  as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now noticed the floor  too  which was of stone.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped  but it was the only one in the dungeon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,all this i saw indistinctly and by much effort for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now lay upon my back  and at full length  on a species of low framework of wood.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body  leaving at liberty only my head  and my left arm to such extent that i could  by dint of much exertion  supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw  to my horror  that the pitcher had been removed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i say to my horror for i was consumed with intolerable thirst.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.
The Pit and the Pendulum,looking upward  i surveyed the ceiling of my prison.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was some thirty or forty feet overhead  and constructed much as the side walls.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented  save that  in lieu of a scythe  he held what  at a casual glance  i supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there was something  however  in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively.
The Pit and the Pendulum,while i gazed directly upward at it  for its position was immediately over my own  i fancied that i saw it in motion.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,its sweep was brief  and of course slow.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i watched it for some minutes  somewhat in fear  but more in wonder.
The Pit and the Pendulum,wearied at length with observing its dull movement  i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a slight noise attracted my notice  and  looking to the floor  i saw several enormous rats traversing it.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they had issued from the well  which lay just within view to my right.
The Pit and the Pendulum,even then  while i gazed  they came up in troops  hurriedly  with ravenous eyes  allured by the scent of the meat.
The Pit and the Pendulum,from this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it might have been half an hour  perhaps even an hour   for i could take but imperfect note of time  before i again cast my eyes upward.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what i then saw confounded and amazed me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as a natural consequence  its velocity was also much greater.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now observed with what horror it is needless to say that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel  about a foot in length from horn to horn  the horns upward  and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,like a razor also  it seemed massy and heavy  tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was appended to a weighty rod of brass  and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents the pit  whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself the pit  typical of hell  and regarded by rumor as the ultima thule of all their punishments.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest of accidents  i knew that surprise  or entrapment into torment  formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths.
The Pit and the Pendulum,having failed to fall  it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss  and thus  there being no alternative  a different and a milder destruction awaited me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,milder  i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such application of such a term.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what boots it to tell of the long  long hours of horror more than mortal  during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the steel  inch by inch line by line with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages down and still down it came  days passed it might have been that many days passed ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i prayed i wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i grew frantically mad  and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then i fell suddenly calm  and lay smiling at the glittering death  as a child at some rare bauble.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there was another interval of utter insensibility  it was brief  for  upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but it might have been long  for i knew there were demons who took note of my swoon  and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon my recovery  too  i felt very oh  inexpressibly sick and weak  as if through long inanition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,even amid the agonies of that period  the human nature craved food.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted  and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as i put a portion of it within my lips  there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy of hope.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet what business had i with hope  it was  as i say  a half formed thought man has many such  which are never completed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt that it was of joy of hope  but felt also that it had perished in its formation.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in vain i struggled to perfect to regain it.
The Pit and the Pendulum,long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was an imbecile an idiot.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it would fray the serge of my robe it would return and repeat its operations again and again.
The Pit and the Pendulum,notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep  some thirty feet or more  and the hissing vigor of its descent  sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron  still the fraying of my robe would be all that  for several minutes  it would accomplish.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and at this thought i paused.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dared not go farther than this reflection.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention as if  in so dwelling  i could arrest here the descent of the steel.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,down steadily down it crept.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to the right to the left far and wide with the shriek of a damned spirit  to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger  i alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.
The Pit and the Pendulum,down certainly  relentlessly down  it vibrated within three inches of my bosom  i struggled violently  furiously  to free my left arm.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this was free only from the elbow to the hand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could reach the latter  from the platter beside me  to my mouth  with great effort  but no farther.
The Pit and the Pendulum,could i have broken the fastenings above the elbow  i would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche   down still unceasingly still inevitably down  i gasped and struggled at each vibration.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i shrunk convulsively at its every sweep.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair  they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent  although death would have been a relief  oh  how unspeakable  still i quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen  glistening axe upon my bosom.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver the frame to shrink.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was hope the hope that triumphs on the rack that whispers to the death condemned even in the dungeons of the inquisition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe  and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen  collected calmness of despair.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for the first time during many hours or perhaps days i thought.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it now occurred to me that the bandage  or surcingle  which enveloped me  was unique.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was tied by no separate cord.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band  would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but how fearful  in that case  the proximity of the steel  the result of the slightest struggle how deadly  was it likely  moreover  that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility  was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum  dreading to find my faint  and  as it seemed  my last hope frustrated  i so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions save in the path of the destroying crescent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position  when there flashed upon my mind what i cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which i have previously alluded  and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when i raised food to my burning lips.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the whole thought was now present feeble  scarcely sane  scarcely definite  but still entire.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i proceeded at once  with the nervous energy of despair  to attempt its execution.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which i lay had been literally swarming with rats.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they were wild  bold  ravenous their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to what food   i thought   have they been accustomed in the well    they had devoured  in spite of all my efforts to prevent them  all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had fallen into an habitual see saw  or wave of the hand about the platter  and  at length  the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained  i thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever i could reach it  then  raising my hand from the floor  i lay breathlessly still.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change at the cessation of movement.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they shrank alarmedly back  many sought the well.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but this was only for a moment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had not counted in vain upon their voracity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,observing that i remained without motion  one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame work  and smelt at the surcingle.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this seemed the signal for a general rush.
The Pit and the Pendulum,forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they clung to the wood they overran it  and leaped in hundreds upon my person.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all.
The Pit and the Pendulum,avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they pressed they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they writhed upon my throat  their cold lips sought my own  i was half stifled by their thronging pressure  disgust  for which the world has no name  swelled my bosom  and chilled  with a heavy clamminess  my heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet one minute  and i felt that the struggle would be over.
The Pit and the Pendulum,plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i knew that in more than one place it must be already severed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with a more than human resolution i lay still.
The Pit and the Pendulum,nor had i erred in my calculations nor had i endured in vain.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i at length felt that i was free.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it had divided the serge of the robe.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it had cut through the linen beneath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,twice again it swung  and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the moment of escape had arrived.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with a steady movement cautious  sidelong  shrinking  and slow i slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for the moment  at least  i was free.
The Pit and the Pendulum,free  and in the grasp of the inquisition  i had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison  when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and i beheld it drawn up  by some invisible force  through the ceiling.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this was a lesson which i took desperately to heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my every motion was undoubtedly watched.
The Pit and the Pendulum,free  i had but escaped death in one form of agony  to be delivered unto worse than death in some other.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with that thought i rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in.
The Pit and the Pendulum,something unusual some change which  at first  i could not appreciate distinctly it was obvious  had taken place in the apartment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction  i busied myself in vain  unconnected conjecture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,during this period  i became aware  for the first time  of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it proceeded from a fissure  about half an inch in width  extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls  which thus appeared  and were  completely separated from the floor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i endeavored  but of course in vain  to look through the aperture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as i arose from the attempt  the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i have observed that  although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct  yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite.
The Pit and the Pendulum,these colors had now assumed  and were momentarily assuming  a startling and most intense brilliancy  that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own.
The Pit and the Pendulum,demon eyes  of a wild and ghastly vivacity  glared upon me in a thousand directions  where none had been visible before  and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.
The Pit and the Pendulum,unreal  even while i breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron  a suffocating odour pervaded the prison  a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies  a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i panted  i gasped for breath  there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors oh  most unrelenting  oh  most demoniac of men  i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended  the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i rushed to its deadly brink.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i threw my straining vision below.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet  for a wild moment  did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length it forced it wrestled its way into my soul it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason.
The Pit and the Pendulum,oh  for a voice to speak  oh  horror  oh  any horror but this  with a shriek  i rushed from the margin  and buried my face in my hands weeping bitterly.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the heat rapidly increased  and once again i looked up  shuddering as with a fit of the ague.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there had been a second change in the cell and now the change was obviously in the form.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as before  it was in vain that i  at first  endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but not long was i left in doubt.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two fold escape  and there was to be no more dallying with the king of terrors.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the room had been square.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that two of its iron angles were now acute two  consequently  obtuse.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the alteration stopped not here i neither hoped nor desired it to stop.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace.
The Pit and the Pendulum,death   i said   any death but that of the pit   fool  might i have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me  could i resist its glow  or  if even that  could i withstand its pressure  and now  flatter and flatter grew the lozenge  with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation.
The Pit and the Pendulum,its centre  and of course  its greatest width  came just over the yawning gulf.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i shrank back but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.

The Premature Burial,the bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which i had bound up my head  in default of my customary nightcap.
The Premature Burial,the tortures endured  however  were indubitably quite equal for the time  to those of actual sepulture.
The Premature Burial,they were fearfully they were inconceivably hideous  but out of evil proceeded good  for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.
The Premature Burial,my soul acquired tone acquired temper.
The Premature Burial,i went abroad.
The Premature Burial,i took vigorous exercise.
The Premature Burial,i breathed the free air of heaven.
The Premature Burial,i thought upon other subjects than death.
The Premature Burial,i discarded my medical books.
The Premature Burial,buchan  i burned.
The Premature Burial,i read no  night thoughts  no fustian about churchyards no bugaboo tales such as this.
The Premature Burial,in short  i became a new man  and lived a man    s life.
The Premature Burial,from that memorable night  i dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions  and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder  of which  perhaps  they had been less the consequence than the cause.
The Premature Burial,there are moments when  even to the sober eye of reason  the world of our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hell but the imagination of man is no carathis  to explore with impunity its every cavern.
The Premature Burial,alas  the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful but  like the demons in whose company afrasiab made his voyage down the oxus  they must sleep  or they will devour us they must be suffered to slumber  or we perish.
The Domain of Arnheim, from his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend ellison along.
The Domain of Arnheim,nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense.
The Domain of Arnheim,i mean it as synonymous with happiness.
The Domain of Arnheim,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of turgot  price  priestley  and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma  that in man    s very nature lies some hidden principle  the antagonist of bliss.
The Domain of Arnheim,an anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in general  from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content and that  even now  in the present darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social condition  it is not impossible that man  the individual  under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions  may be happy.
The Domain of Arnheim,with opinions such as these my young friend  too  was fully imbued  and thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was  in great measure  the result of preconcert.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which  now and then  stands so well in the stead of experience  mr. ellison would have found himself precipitated  by the very extraordinary success of his life  into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of pre eminent endowments.
The Domain of Arnheim,but it is by no means my object to pen an essay on happiness.
The Domain of Arnheim,the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words.
The Domain of Arnheim,he admitted but four elementary principles  or more strictly  conditions of bliss.
The Domain of Arnheim,that which he considered chief was  strange to say   the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air.
The Domain of Arnheim,the health   he said   attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.
The Domain of Arnheim,he instanced the ecstasies of the fox hunter  and pointed to the tillers of the earth  the only people who  as a class  can be fairly considered happier than others.
The Domain of Arnheim,his second condition was the love of woman.
The Domain of Arnheim,his third  and most difficult of realization  was the contempt of ambition.
The Domain of Arnheim,his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit  and he held that  other things being equal  the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality of this object.
The Domain of Arnheim,ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune.
The Domain of Arnheim,in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men.
The Domain of Arnheim,his intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity.
The Domain of Arnheim,his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire.
The Domain of Arnheim,his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.
The Domain of Arnheim,his possessions had been always ample  but on the attainment of his majority  it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur  and seldom fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their objects.
The Domain of Arnheim,it appears that about a hundred years before mr. ellison    s coming of age  there had died  in a remote province  one mr. seabright ellison.
The Domain of Arnheim,this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune  and  having no immediate connections  conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.
The Domain of Arnheim,minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment  he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood  bearing the name of ellison  who should be alive at the end of the hundred years.
The Domain of Arnheim,many attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest  their ex post facto character rendered them abortive  but the attention of a jealous government was aroused  and a legislative act finally obtained  forbidding all similar accumulations.
The Domain of Arnheim,this act  however  did not prevent young ellison from entering into possession  on his twenty first birthday  as the heir of his ancestor seabright  of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.
The Domain of Arnheim,when it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited  there were  of course  many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.
The Domain of Arnheim,the magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic.
The Domain of Arnheim,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.
The Domain of Arnheim,with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen  it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigue or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility or collecting large museums of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters  of science  of art or endowing  and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity.
The Domain of Arnheim,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir  these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.
The Domain of Arnheim,recourse was had to figures  and these but sufficed to confound.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was seen that  even at three per cent.
The Domain of Arnheim,the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars  which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month  or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day  or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour  or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew.
The Domain of Arnheim,thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up.
The Domain of Arnheim,men knew not what to imagine.
The Domain of Arnheim,there were some who even conceived that mr. ellison would divest himself of at least one half of his fortune  as of utterly superfluous opulence enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the nearest of these he did  in fact  abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the inheritance.
The Domain of Arnheim,i was not surprised  however  to perceive that he had long made up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.
The Domain of Arnheim,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision.
The Domain of Arnheim,in regard to individual charities he had satisfied his conscience.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the possibility of any improvement  properly so called  being effected by man himself in the general condition of man  he had  i am sorry to confess it  little faith.
The Domain of Arnheim,upon the whole  whether happily or unhappily  he was thrown back  in very great measure  upon self.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet.
The Domain of Arnheim,he comprehended  moreover  the true character  the august aims  the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.
The Domain of Arnheim,the fullest  if not the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,some peculiarities  either in his early education  or in the nature of his intellect  had tinged with what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations  and it was this bias  perhaps  which led him to believe that the most advantageous at least  if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise  lies in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness.
The Domain of Arnheim,thus it happened he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation.
The Domain of Arnheim,or it might have been that he neglected to become either  merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on earth.
The Domain of Arnheim,is it not indeed  possible that  while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious  the highest is above that which is termed ambition  and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained  mute and inglorious   i believe that the world has never seen and that  unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion  the world will never see that full extent of triumphant execution  in the richer domains of art  of which the human nature is absolutely capable.
The Domain of Arnheim,ellison became neither musician nor poet  although no man lived more profoundly enamored of music and poetry.
The Domain of Arnheim,under other circumstances than those which invested him  it is not impossible that he would have become a painter.
The Domain of Arnheim,sculpture  although in its nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and consequences  to have occupied  at any time  much of his attention.
The Domain of Arnheim,and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable of expatiating.
The Domain of Arnheim,but ellison maintained that the richest  the truest  and most natural  if not altogether the most extensive province  had been unaccountably neglected.
The Domain of Arnheim,no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet  yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the proper muse the most magnificent of opportunities.
The Domain of Arnheim,here  indeed  was the fairest field for the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty  the elements to enter into combination being  by a vast superiority  the most glorious which the earth could afford.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees  he recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness.
The Domain of Arnheim,and in the direction or concentration of this effort or  more properly  in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment  not only of his own destiny as poet  but of the august purposes for which the deity had implanted the poetic sentiment in man.
The Domain of Arnheim,its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.
The Domain of Arnheim,in his explanation of this phraseology  mr. ellison did much toward solving what has always seemed to me an enigma  i mean the fact  which none but the ignorant dispute  that no such combination of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce.
The Domain of Arnheim,no such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of claude.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the most enchanting of natural landscapes  there will always be found a defect or an excess many excesses and defects.
The Domain of Arnheim,while the component parts may defy  individually  the highest skill of the artist  the arrangement of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement.
The Domain of Arnheim,in short  no position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth  from which an artistical eye  looking steadily  will not find matter of offence in what is termed the  composition  of the landscape.
The Domain of Arnheim,and yet how unintelligible is this  in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme.
The Domain of Arnheim,with her details we shrink from competition.
The Domain of Arnheim,who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip  or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley  the criticism which says  of sculpture or portraiture  that here nature is to be exalted or idealized rather than imitated  is in error.
The Domain of Arnheim,no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the living and breathing beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true  and  having felt its truth here  it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art.
The Domain of Arnheim,having  i say  felt its truth here  for the feeling is no affectation or chimera.
The Domain of Arnheim,the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the artist.
The Domain of Arnheim,he not only believes  but positively knows  that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute the true beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,his reasons  however  have not yet been matured into expression.
The Domain of Arnheim,it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen  fully to investigate and express them.
The Domain of Arnheim,nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of all his brethren.
The Domain of Arnheim,let a  composition  be defective  let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form  let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world  by each will its necessity be admitted.
The Domain of Arnheim,and even far more than this  in remedy of the defective composition  each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.
The Domain of Arnheim,i repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation  and that  therefore  her susceptibility of improvement at this one point  was a mystery i had been unable to solve.
The Domain of Arnheim,my own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would have so arranged the earth    s surface as to have fulfilled at all points man    s sense of perfection in the beautiful  the sublime  or the picturesque  but that this primitive intention had been frustrated by the known geological disturbances disturbances of form and color grouping  in the correction or allaying of which lies the soul of art.
The Domain of Arnheim,the force of this idea was much weakened  however  by the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death.
The Domain of Arnheim,he thus explained  admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first intention.
The Domain of Arnheim,we have then the primitive arrangement of the earth    s surface adapted to his blissful estate  as not existent but designed.
The Domain of Arnheim,the disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.
The Domain of Arnheim,now   said my friend   what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may be really such  as respects only the moral or human point of view.
The Domain of Arnheim,each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the picture  if we can suppose this picture viewed at large in mass from some point distant from the earth    s surface  although not beyond the limits of its atmosphere.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is easily understood that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail  may at the same time injure a general or more distantly observed effect.
The Domain of Arnheim,there may be a class of beings  human once  but now invisible to humanity  to whom  from afar  our disorder may seem order our unpicturesqueness picturesque  in a word  the earth angels  for whose scrutiny more especially than our own  and for whose death refined appreciation of the beautiful  may have been set in array by god the wide landscape gardens of the hemispheres.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the course of discussion  my friend quoted some passages from a writer on landscape gardening who has been supposed to have well treated his theme    there are properly but two styles of landscape gardening  the natural and the artificial.
The Domain of Arnheim,one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country  by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery  cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land  detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size  proportion  and color which  hid from the common observer  are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature.
The Domain of Arnheim,the result of the natural style of gardening  is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.
The Domain of Arnheim,the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.
The Domain of Arnheim,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building.
The Domain of Arnheim,there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles  italian terraces  and a various mixed old english style  which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture.
The Domain of Arnheim,whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening  a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,this is partly pleasing to the eye  by the show of order and design  and partly moral.
The Domain of Arnheim,a terrace  with an old moss covered balustrade  calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days.
The Domain of Arnheim,the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest.
The Domain of Arnheim,from what i have already observed   said ellison   you will understand that i reject the idea  here expressed  of recalling the original beauty of the country.
The Domain of Arnheim,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced.
The Domain of Arnheim,of course  every thing depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities.
The Domain of Arnheim,what is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of size  proportion  and color  is one of those mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.
The Domain of Arnheim,the phrase quoted may mean any thing  or nothing  and guides in no degree.
The Domain of Arnheim,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles  is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius.
The Domain of Arnheim,the negative merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which  in letters  would elevate addison into apotheosis.
The Domain of Arnheim,in truth  while that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding  and can thus be circumscribed in rule  the loftier virtue  which flames in creation  can be apprehended in its results alone.
The Domain of Arnheim,rule applies but to the merits of denial to the excellencies which refrain.
The Domain of Arnheim,beyond these  the critical art can but suggest.
The Domain of Arnheim,we may be instructed to build a  cato   but we are in vain told how to conceive a parthenon or an  inferno.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thing done  however  the wonder accomplished  and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal.
The Domain of Arnheim,the sophists of the negative school who  through inability to create  have scoffed at creation  are now found the loudest in applause.
The Domain of Arnheim,what  in its chrysalis condition of principle  affronted their demure reason  never fails  in its maturity of accomplishment  to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,the author    s observations on the artificial style   continued ellison   are less objectionable.
The Domain of Arnheim,a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,this is just  as also is the reference to the sense of human interest.
The Domain of Arnheim,the principle expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something beyond it.
The Domain of Arnheim,there may be an object in keeping with the principle an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by individuals  yet which  if attained  would lend a charm to the landscape garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human interest could bestow.
The Domain of Arnheim,a poet  having very unusual pecuniary resources  might  while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture  or  as our author expresses it  of interest  so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty  as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference.
The Domain of Arnheim,it will be seen that  in bringing about such result  he secures all the advantages of interest or design  while relieving his work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the most rugged of wildernesses in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator  yet this art is apparent to reflection only  in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.
The Domain of Arnheim,now let us suppose this sense of the almighty design to be one step depressed to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art to form an intermedium between the two  let us imagine  for example  a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness whose united beauty  magnificence  and strangeness  shall convey the idea of care  or culture  or superintendence  on the part of beings superior  yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of interest is preserved  while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god  nor an emanation from god  but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such as this in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal superintendence of his plans in the unceasing object which these plans afforded in the high spirituality of the object in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel in the perennial springs with which it gratified  without possibility of satiating  that one master passion of his soul  the thirst for beauty  above all  it was in the sympathy of a woman  not unwomanly  whose loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of paradise  that ellison thought to find  and found  exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity  with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day dreams of de sta  l.  i despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish.
The Domain of Arnheim,i wish to describe  but am disheartened by the difficulty of description  and hesitate between detail and generality.
The Domain of Arnheim,perhaps the better course will be to unite the two in their extremes.
The Domain of Arnheim,mr. ellison    s first step regarded  of course  the choice of a locality  and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point  when the luxuriant nature of the pacific islands arrested his attention.
The Domain of Arnheim,in fact  he had made up his mind for a voyage to the south seas  when a night    s reflection induced him to abandon the idea.
The Domain of Arnheim,were i misanthropic   he said   such a locale would suit me.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion  and the difficulty of ingress and egress  would in such case be the charm of charms  but as yet i am not timon.
The Domain of Arnheim,i wish the composure but not the depression of solitude.
The Domain of Arnheim,there must remain with me a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose.
The Domain of Arnheim,there will be frequent hours in which i shall need  too  the sympathy of the poetic in what i have done.
The Domain of Arnheim,let me seek  then  a spot not far from a populous city whose vicinity  also  will best enable me to execute my plans.
The Domain of Arnheim,in search of a suitable place so situated  ellison travelled for several years  and i was permitted to accompany him.
The Domain of Arnheim,a thousand spots with which i was enraptured he rejected without hesitation  for reasons which satisfied me  in the end  that he was right.
The Domain of Arnheim,we came at length to an elevated table land of wonderful fertility and beauty  affording a panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of aetna  and  in ellison    s opinion as well as my own  surpassing the far famed view from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.
The Domain of Arnheim,i am aware   said the traveller  as he drew a sigh of deep delight after gazing on this scene  entranced  for nearly an hour   i know that here  in my circumstances  nine tenths of the most fastidious of men would rest content.
The Domain of Arnheim,this panorama is indeed glorious  and i should rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory.
The Domain of Arnheim,the taste of all the architects i have ever known leads them  for the sake of     prospect      to put up buildings on hill tops.
The Domain of Arnheim,the error is obvious.
The Domain of Arnheim,grandeur in any of its moods  but especially in that of extent  startles  excites and then fatigues  depresses.
The Domain of Arnheim,for the occasional scene nothing can be better for the constant view nothing worse.
The Domain of Arnheim,and  in the constant view  the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent  the worst phase of extent  that of distance.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is at war with the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in     retiring to the country.
The Domain of Arnheim,in looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling abroad in the world.
The Domain of Arnheim,the heart sick avoid distant prospects as a pestilence.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that we found a locality with which ellison professed himself satisfied.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is  of course  needless to say where was the locality.
The Domain of Arnheim,the late death of my friend  in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors  has given to arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity  similar in kind  although infinitely superior in degree  to that which so long distinguished fonthill.
The Domain of Arnheim,the usual approach to arnheim was by the river.
The Domain of Arnheim,the visitor left the city in the early morning.
The Domain of Arnheim,during the forenoon he passed between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty  on which grazed innumerable sheep  their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows.
The Domain of Arnheim,by degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care.
The Domain of Arnheim,this slowly became merged in a sense of retirement this again in a consciousness of solitude.
The Domain of Arnheim,as the evening approached  the channel grew more narrow  the banks more and more precipitous  and these latter were clothed in rich  more profuse  and more sombre foliage.
The Domain of Arnheim,the water increased in transparency.
The Domain of Arnheim,the stream took a thousand turns  so that at no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a furlong.
The Domain of Arnheim,at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted circle  having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage  a roof of ultramarine satin  and no floor the keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which  by some accident having been turned upside down  floated in constant company with the substantial one  for the purpose of sustaining it.
The Domain of Arnheim,the channel now became a gorge although the term is somewhat inapplicable  and i employ it merely because the language has no word which better represents the most striking not the most distinctive feature of the scene.
The Domain of Arnheim,the character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores  it was lost altogether in their other traits.
The Domain of Arnheim,the walls of the ravine  through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed  arose to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet  and inclined so much toward each other as  in a great measure  to shut out the light of day  while the long plume like moss which depended densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead  gave the whole chasm an air of funereal gloom.
The Domain of Arnheim,the windings became more frequent and intricate  and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves  so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction.
The Domain of Arnheim,he was  moreover  enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thought of nature still remained  but her character seemed to have undergone modification  there was a weird symmetry  a thrilling uniformity  a wizard propriety in these her works.
The Domain of Arnheim,not a dead branch not a withered leaf not a stray pebble not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible.
The Domain of Arnheim,the crystal water welled up against the clean granite  or the unblemished moss  with a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.
The Domain of Arnheim,having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours  the gloom deepening every moment  a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought it suddenly  as if dropped from heaven  into a circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was about two hundred yards in diameter  and girt in at all points but one that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered by hills equal in general height to the walls of the chasm  although of a thoroughly different character.
The Domain of Arnheim,their sides sloped from the water    s edge at an angle of some forty five degrees  and they were clothed from base to summit not a perceptible point escaping in a drapery of the most gorgeous flower blossoms  scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of odorous and fluctuating color.
The Domain of Arnheim,this basin was of great depth  but so transparent was the water that the bottom  which seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles  was distinctly visible by glimpses that is to say  whenever the eye could permit itself not to see  far down in the inverted heaven  the duplicate blooming of the hills.
The Domain of Arnheim,on these latter there were no trees  nor even shrubs of any size.
The Domain of Arnheim,the impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness  warmth  color  quietude  uniformity  softness  delicacy  daintiness  voluptuousness  and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies  laborious  tasteful  magnificent  and fastidious  but as the eye traced upward the myriad tinted slope  from its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud  it became  indeed  difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies  sapphires  opals  and golden onyxes  rolling silently out of the sky.
The Domain of Arnheim,the visitor  shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the ravine  is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun  which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon  but which now confronts him  and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another chasm like rift in the hills.
The Domain of Arnheim,but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far  and descends into a light canoe of ivory  stained with arabesque devices in vivid scarlet  both within and without.
The Domain of Arnheim,the poop and beak of this boat arise high above the water  with sharp points  so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent.
The Domain of Arnheim,it lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan.
The Domain of Arnheim,on its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satin wood  but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen.
The Domain of Arnheim,the guest is bidden to be of good cheer that the fates will take care of him.
The Domain of Arnheim,the larger vessel disappears  and he is left alone in the canoe  which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.
The Domain of Arnheim,while he considers what course to pursue  however  he becomes aware of a gentle movement in the fairy bark.
The Domain of Arnheim,it slowly swings itself around until its prow points toward the sun.
The Domain of Arnheim,it advances with a gentle but gradually accelerated velocity  while the slight ripples it creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest melody seem to offer the only possible explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.
The Domain of Arnheim,the canoe steadily proceeds  and the rocky gate of the vista is approached  so that its depths can be more distinctly seen.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is observed  however  that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank dips into the water  still prevails.
The Domain of Arnheim,there is not one token of the usual river d  bris.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the left the character of the scene is softer and more obviously artificial.
The Domain of Arnheim,here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very gentle ascent  forming a broad sward of grass of a texture resembling nothing so much as velvet  and of a brilliancy of green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald.
The Domain of Arnheim,this plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred yards  reaching from the river bank to a wall  fifty feet high  which extends  in an infinity of curves  but following the general direction of the river  until lost in the distance to the westward.
The Domain of Arnheim,this wall is of one continuous rock  and has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream    s southern bank  but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain.
The Domain of Arnheim,the chiselled stone has the hue of ages  and is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy  the coral honeysuckle  the eglantine  and the clematis.
The Domain of Arnheim,the uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height  growing singly or in small groups  both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall  but in close proximity to it  so that frequent limbs  of the black walnut especially  reach over and dip their pendent extremities into the water.
The Domain of Arnheim,farther back within the domain  the vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.
The Domain of Arnheim,these things are observed during the canoe    s gradual approach to what i have called the gate of the vista.
The Domain of Arnheim,on drawing nearer to this  however  its chasm like appearance vanishes  a new outlet from the bay is discovered to the left in which direction the wall is also seen to sweep  still following the general course of the stream.
The Domain of Arnheim,down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very far  for the stream  accompanied by the wall  still bends to the left  until both are swallowed up by the leaves.
The Domain of Arnheim,the boat  nevertheless  glides magically into the winding channel  and here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista.
The Domain of Arnheim,lofty hills  rising occasionally into mountains  and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance  still shut in the scene.
The Domain of Arnheim,floating gently onward  but with a velocity slightly augmented  the voyager  after many short turns  finds his progress apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold  elaborately carved and fretted  and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast sinking sun with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames.
The Domain of Arnheim,this gate is inserted in the lofty wall  which here appears to cross the river at right angles.
The Domain of Arnheim,in a few moments  however  it is seen that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the left  the wall following it as before  while a stream of considerable volume  diverging from the principal one  makes its way  with a slight ripple  under the door  and is thus hidden from sight.
The Domain of Arnheim,the canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate.
The Domain of Arnheim,its ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded.
The Domain of Arnheim,the boat glides between them  and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple mountains  whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit.
The Domain of Arnheim,meantime the whole paradise of arnheim bursts upon the view.
The Domain of Arnheim,there is a gush of entrancing melody  there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor  there is a dream like intermingling to the eye of tall slender eastern trees bosky shrubberies flocks of golden and crimson birds lily fringed lakes meadows of violets  tulips  poppies  hyacinths  and tuberoses long intertangled lines of silver streamlets and  upspringing confusedly from amid all  a mass of semi gothic  semi saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in mid air  glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels  minarets  and pinnacles  and seeming the phantom handiwork  conjointly  of the sylphs  of the fairies  of the genii and of the gnomes.
Landor's Cottage, during a pedestrian trip last summer  through one or two of the river counties of new york  i found myself  as the day declined  somewhat embarrassed about the road i was pursuing.
Landor's Cottage,the land undulated very remarkably  and my path  for the last hour  had wound about and about so confusedly  in its effort to keep in the valleys  that i no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of b    where i had determined to stop for the night.
Landor's Cottage,the sun had scarcely shone strictly speaking during the day  which nevertheless  had been unpleasantly warm.
Landor's Cottage,a smoky mist  resembling that of the indian summer  enveloped all things  and of course  added to my uncertainty.
Landor's Cottage,not that i cared much about the matter.
Landor's Cottage,if i did not hit upon the village before sunset  or even before dark  it was more than possible that a little dutch farmhouse  or something of that kind  would soon make its appearance although  in fact  the neighborhood  perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile  was very sparsely inhabited.
Landor's Cottage,at all events  with my knapsack for a pillow  and my hound as a sentry  a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.
Landor's Cottage,i sauntered on  therefore  quite at ease ponto taking charge of my gun until at length  just as i had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither  were intended to be paths at all  i was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.
Landor's Cottage,there could be no mistaking it.
Landor's Cottage,the traces of light wheels were evident  and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead  there was no obstruction whatever below  even to the passage of a virginian mountain wagon the most aspiring vehicle  i take it  of its kind.
Landor's Cottage,the road  however  except in being open through the wood if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees and except in the particulars of evident wheel tracks bore no resemblance to any road i had before seen.
Landor's Cottage,the tracks of which i speak were but faintly perceptible having been impressed upon the firm  yet pleasantly moist surface of what looked more like green genoese velvet than any thing else.
Landor's Cottage,it was grass  clearly but grass such as we seldom see out of england so short  so thick  so even  and so vivid in color.
Landor's Cottage,not a single impediment lay in the wheel route not even a chip or dead twig.
Landor's Cottage,the stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed not thrown along the sides of the lane  so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half precise  half negligent  and wholly picturesque definition.
Landor's Cottage,clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere  luxuriantly  in the interspaces.
Landor's Cottage,what to make of all this  of course i knew not.
Landor's Cottage,here was art undoubtedly that did not surprise me all roads  in the ordinary sense  are works of art  nor can i say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested  all that seemed to have been done  might have been done here with such natural  capabilities   as they have it in the books on landscape gardening  with very little labor and expense.
Landor's Cottage,no  it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration.
Landor's Cottage,one thing became more and more evident the longer i gazed  an artist  and one with a most scrupulous eye for form  had superintended all these arrangements.
Landor's Cottage,the greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand  and the pittoresque  in the true sense of the italian term  on the other.
Landor's Cottage,there were few straight  and no long uninterrupted lines.
Landor's Cottage,the same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice  usually  but not oftener  at any one point of view.
Landor's Cottage,everywhere was variety in uniformity.
Landor's Cottage,it was a piece of  composition   in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.
Landor's Cottage,i had turned to the right as i entered this road  and now  arising  i continued in the same direction.
Landor's Cottage,the path was so serpentine  that at no moment could i trace its course for more than two or three paces in advance.
Landor's Cottage,its character did not undergo any material change.
Landor's Cottage,presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear and in a few moments afterward  as i turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto  i became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me.
Landor's Cottage,i could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below.
Landor's Cottage,a gentle breeze  however  now arose  as the sun was about descending  and while i remained standing on the brow of the slope  the fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths  and so floated over the scene.
Landor's Cottage,as it came fully into view thus gradually as i describe it piece by piece  here a tree  there a glimpse of water  and here again the summit of a chimney  i could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of  vanishing pictures.
Landor's Cottage,by the time  however  that the fog had thoroughly disappeared  the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills  and thence  as if with a slight chassez to the south  had come again fully into sight  glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west.
Landor's Cottage,suddenly  therefore and as if by the hand of magic this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.
Landor's Cottage,the first coup d      il  as the sun slid into the position described  impressed me very much as i have been impressed  when a boy  by the concluding scene of some well arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama.
Landor's Cottage,not even the monstrosity of color was wanting  for the sunlight came out through the chasm  tinted all orange and purple  while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead  as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.
Landor's Cottage,the little vale into which i thus peered down from under the fog canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long  while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.
Landor's Cottage,it was most narrow at its northern extremity  opening out as it tended southwardly  but with no very precise regularity.
Landor's Cottage,the widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme.
Landor's Cottage,the slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills  unless at their northern face.
Landor's Cottage,here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet  and  as i have mentioned  the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide  but as the visitor proceeded southwardly from the cliff  he found on his right hand and on his left  declivities at once less high  less precipitous  and less rocky.
Landor's Cottage,all  in a word  sloped and softened to the south  and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences  more or less high  except at two points.
Landor's Cottage,one of these i have already spoken of.
Landor's Cottage,it lay considerably to the north of west  and was where the setting sun made its way  as i have before described  into the amphitheatre  through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment  this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point  so far as the eye could trace it.
Landor's Cottage,it seemed to lead up  up like a natural causeway  into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.
Landor's Cottage,the other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,here  generally  the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations  extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards.
Landor's Cottage,in the middle of this extent was a depression  level with the ordinary floor of the valley.
Landor's Cottage,as regards vegetation  as well as in respect to every thing else  the scene softened and sloped to the south.
Landor's Cottage,to the north on the craggy precipice a few paces from the verge up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories  black walnuts  and chestnuts  interspersed with occasional oak  and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially  spread far over the edge of the cliff.
Landor's Cottage,proceeding southwardly  the explorer saw  at first  the same class of trees  but less and less lofty and salvatorish in character  then he saw the gentler elm  succeeded by the sassafras and locust these again by the softer linden  red bud  catalpa  and maple these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties.
Landor's Cottage,the whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone an occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted.
Landor's Cottage,in the bottom of the valley itself  for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides  were to be seen three insulated trees.
Landor's Cottage,one was an elm of fine size and exquisite form  it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,another was a hickory  much larger than the elm  and altogether a much finer tree  although both were exceedingly beautiful  it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance  springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine  and throwing its graceful body  at an angle of nearly forty five degrees  far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre.
Landor's Cottage,about thirty yards east of this tree stood  however  the pride of the valley  and beyond all question the most magnificent tree i have ever seen  unless  perhaps  among the cypresses of the itchiatuckanee.
Landor's Cottage,it was a triple stemmed tulip tree the liriodendron tulipiferum one of the natural order of magnolias.
Landor's Cottage,its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil  and diverging very slightly and gradually  were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage  this was at an elevation of about eighty feet.
Landor's Cottage,the whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet.
Landor's Cottage,nothing can surpass in beauty the form  or the glossy  vivid green of the leaves of the tulip tree.
Landor's Cottage,in the present instance they were fully eight inches wide  but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms.
Landor's Cottage,conceive  closely congregated  a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips  only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture i would convey.
Landor's Cottage,and then the stately grace of the clean  delicately granulated columnar stems  the largest four feet in diameter  at twenty from the ground.
Landor's Cottage,the innumerable blossoms  mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful  although infinitely less majestic  filled the valley with more than arabian perfumes.
Landor's Cottage,the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that i had found in the road  if anything  more deliciously soft  thick  velvety  and miraculously green.
Landor's Cottage,it was hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.
Landor's Cottage,i have spoken of two openings into the vale.
Landor's Cottage,from the one to the northwest issued a rivulet  which came  gently murmuring and slightly foaming  down the ravine  until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory.
Landor's Cottage,here  after encircling the tree  it passed on a little to the north of east  leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south  and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.
Landor's Cottage,at this point  after a series of sweeps  it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure  although roughly oval   that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,this lakelet was  perhaps  a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part.
Landor's Cottage,no crystal could be clearer than its waters.
Landor's Cottage,its bottom  which could be distinctly seen  consisted altogether  of pebbles brilliantly white.
Landor's Cottage,its banks  of the emerald grass already described  rounded  rather than sloped  off into the clear heaven below  and so clear was this heaven  so perfectly  at times  did it reflect all objects above it  that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced  it was a point of no little difficulty to determine.
Landor's Cottage,the trout  and some other varieties of fish  with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded  had all the appearance of veritable flying fish.
Landor's Cottage,it was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air.
Landor's Cottage,a light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water  was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror.
Landor's Cottage,a small island  fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom  and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building  seemingly a fowl house arose from the lake not far from its northern shore to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light looking and yet very primitive bridge.
Landor's Cottage,it was formed of a single  broad and thick plank of the tulip wood.
Landor's Cottage,this was forty feet long  and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch  preventing all oscillation.
Landor's Cottage,from the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet  which  after meandering for  perhaps  thirty yards  finally passed through the  depression   already described  in the middle of the southern declivity  and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet  made its devious and unnoticed way to the hudson.
Landor's Cottage,the lake was deep at some points thirty feet but the rivulet seldom exceeded three  while its greatest width was about eight.
Landor's Cottage,its bottom and banks were as those of the pond if a defect could have been attributed  in point of picturesqueness  it was that of excessive neatness.
Landor's Cottage,the expanse of the green turf was relieved  here and there  by an occasional showy shrub  such as the hydrangea  or the common snowball  or the aromatic seringa  or  more frequently  by a clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.
Landor's Cottage,these latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the soil  so as to give the plants the appearance of being indigenous.
Landor's Cottage,besides all this  the lawn    s velvet was exquisitely spotted with sheep a considerable flock of which roamed about the vale  in company with three tamed deer  and a vast number of brilliantly plumed ducks.
Landor's Cottage,a very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant attendance upon these animals  each and all.
Landor's Cottage,along the eastern and western cliffs where  toward the upper portion of the amphitheatre  the boundaries were more or less precipitous grew ivy in great profusion so that only here and there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained.
Landor's Cottage,the northern precipice  in like manner  was almost entirely clothed by grape vines of rare luxuriance  some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff  and others from ledges on its face.
Landor's Cottage,the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little domain  was crowned by a neat stone wall  of sufficient height to prevent the escape of the deer.
Landor's Cottage,nothing of the fence kind was observable elsewhere  for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed  any stray sheep  for example  which should attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine  would find its progress arrested  after a few yards     advance  by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as i first drew near the domain.
Landor's Cottage,in short  the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky pass in the road  a few paces below the point at which i stopped to reconnoitre the scene.
Landor's Cottage,i have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course.
Landor's Cottage,its two general directions  as i have said  were first from west to east  and then from north to south.
Landor's Cottage,at the turn  the stream  sweeping backward  made an almost circular loop  so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island  and which included about the sixteenth of an acre.
Landor's Cottage,on this peninsula stood a dwelling house and when i say that this house  like the infernal terrace seen by vathek   etait d    une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre   i mean  merely  that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety in a word  of poetry  for  than in the words just employed  i could scarcely give  of poetry in the abstract  a more rigorous definition  and i do not mean that merely outre was perceptible in any respect.
Landor's Cottage,in fact nothing could well be more simple more utterly unpretending than this cottage.
Landor's Cottage,its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture.
Landor's Cottage,i could have fancied  while i looked at it  that some eminent landscape painter had built it with his brush.
Landor's Cottage,the point of view from which i first saw the valley  was not altogether  although it was nearly  the best point from which to survey the house.
Landor's Cottage,i will therefore describe it as i afterwards saw it from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.
Landor's Cottage,the main building was about twenty four feet long and sixteen broad certainly not more.
Landor's Cottage,its total height  from the ground to the apex of the roof  could not have exceeded eighteen feet.
Landor's Cottage,to the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions  the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house  and the line of its roof  of course  being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining.
Landor's Cottage,at right angles to these buildings  and from the rear of the main one not exactly in the middle extended a third compartment  very small being  in general  one third less than the western wing.
Landor's Cottage,the roofs of the two larger were very steep sweeping down from the ridge beam with a long concave curve  and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front  so as to form the roofs of two piazzas.
Landor's Cottage,these latter roofs  of course  needed no support  but as they had the air of needing it  slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone.
Landor's Cottage,the roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.
Landor's Cottage,between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard dutch bricks  alternately black and red  a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top.
Landor's Cottage,over the gables the roofs also projected very much  in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west.
Landor's Cottage,the principal door was not exactly in the main division  being a little to the east while the two windows were to the west.
Landor's Cottage,these latter did not extend to the floor  but were much longer and narrower than usual they had single shutters like doors the panes were of lozenge form  but quite large.
Landor's Cottage,the door itself had its upper half of glass  also in lozenge panes a movable shutter secured it at night.
Landor's Cottage,the door to the west wing was in its gable  and quite simple a single window looked out to the south.
Landor's Cottage,there was no external door to the north wing  and it also had only one window to the east.
Landor's Cottage,the blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs  with a balustrade  running diagonally across it the ascent being from the south.
Landor's Cottage,under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access to a door leading to the garret  or rather loft for it was lighted only by a single window to the north  and seemed to have been intended as a store room.
Landor's Cottage,the piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors  as is usual  but at the doors and at each window  large  flat irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf  affording comfortable footing in all weather.
Landor's Cottage,excellent paths of the same material not nicely adapted  but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the stones  led hither and thither from the house  to a crystal spring about five paces off  to the road  or to one or two out houses that lay to the north  beyond the brook  and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts and catalpas.
Landor's Cottage,not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead trunk of a fantastic pear tree  so clothed from head to foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could be.
Landor's Cottage,from various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.
Landor's Cottage,in one  a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top  revelled a mocking bird  in another an oriole  in a third the impudent bobolink while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.
Landor's Cottage,the pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet honeysuckle  while from the angle formed by the main structure and its west wing  in front  sprang a grape vine of unexampled luxuriance.
Landor's Cottage,scorning all restraint  it had clambered first to the lower roof then to the higher  and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe on  throwing out tendrils to the right and left  until at length it fairly attained the east gable  and fell trailing over the stairs.
Landor's Cottage,the whole house  with its wings  was constructed of the old fashioned dutch shingles broad  and with unrounded corners.
Landor's Cottage,it is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top after the manner of egyptian architecture  and in the present instance  this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the buildings.
Landor's Cottage,the shingles were painted a dull gray  and the happiness with which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage  can readily be conceived by an artist.
Landor's Cottage,from the position near the stone wall  as described  the buildings were seen at great advantage for the southeastern angle was thrown forward so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts  with the picturesque eastern gable  and at the same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing  with parts of a pretty roof to the spring house  and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.
Landor's Cottage,i did not remain very long on the brow of the hill  although long enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet.
Landor's Cottage,it was clear that i had wandered from the road to the village  and i had thus good traveller    s excuse to open the gate before me  and inquire my way  at all events  so  without more ado  i proceeded.
Landor's Cottage,the road  after passing the gate  seemed to lie upon a natural ledge  sloping gradually down along the face of the north eastern cliffs.
Landor's Cottage,it led me on to the foot of the northern precipice  and thence over the bridge  round by the eastern gable to the front door.
Landor's Cottage,in this progress  i took notice that no sight of the out houses could be obtained.
Landor's Cottage,as i turned the corner of the gable  the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence  but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger.
Landor's Cottage,i held him out my hand  however  in token of amity and i never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy.
Landor's Cottage,he not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail  but absolutely offered me his paw afterward extending his civilities to ponto.
Landor's Cottage,as no bell was discernible  i rapped with my stick against the door  which stood half open.
Landor's Cottage,instantly a figure advanced to the threshold that of a young woman about twenty eight years of age slender  or rather slight  and somewhat above the medium height.
Landor's Cottage,as she approached  with a certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable.
Landor's Cottage,i said to myself   surely here i have found the perfection of natural  in contradistinction from artificial grace.
Landor's Cottage,the second impression which she made on me  but by far the more vivid of the two  was that of enthusiasm.
Landor's Cottage,so intense an expression of romance  perhaps i should call it  or of unworldliness  as that which gleamed from her deep set eyes  had never so sunk into my heart of hearts before.
Landor's Cottage,i know not how it is  but this peculiar expression of the eye  wreathing itself occasionally into the lips  is the most powerful  if not absolutely the sole spell  which rivets my interest in woman.
Landor's Cottage,romance   provided my readers fully comprehended what i would here imply by the word  romance  and  womanliness  seem to me convertible terms  and  after all  what man truly loves in woman  is simply her womanhood.
Landor's Cottage,the eyes of annie  i heard some one from the interior call her  annie  darling    were  spiritual grey   her hair  a light chestnut  this is all i had time to observe of her.
Landor's Cottage,at her most courteous of invitations  i entered passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule.
Landor's Cottage,having come mainly to observe  i took notice that to my right as i stepped in  was a window  such as those in front of the house  to the left  a door leading into the principal room  while  opposite me  an open door enabled me to see a small apartment  just the size of the vestibule  arranged as a study  and having a large bow window looking out to the north.
Landor's Cottage,passing into the parlor  i found myself with mr. landor for this  i afterwards found  was his name.
Landor's Cottage,he was civil  even cordial in his manner  but just then  i was more intent on observing the arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me  than the personal appearance of the tenant.
Landor's Cottage,the north wing  i now saw  was a bed chamber  its door opened into the parlor.
Landor's Cottage,west of this door was a single window  looking toward the brook.
Landor's Cottage,at the west end of the parlor  were a fireplace  and a door leading into the west wing probably a kitchen.
Landor's Cottage,nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor.
Landor's Cottage,on the floor was an ingrain carpet  of excellent texture a white ground  spotted with small circular green figures.
Landor's Cottage,at the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin  they were tolerably full  and hung decisively  perhaps rather formally in sharp  parallel plaits to the floor just to the floor.
Landor's Cottage,the walls were prepared with a french paper of great delicacy  a silver ground  with a faint green cord running zig zag throughout.
Landor's Cottage,its expanse was relieved merely by three of julien    s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons  fastened to the wall without frames.
Landor's Cottage,one of these drawings was a scene of oriental luxury  or rather voluptuousness  another was a  carnival piece   spirited beyond compare  the third was a greek female head a face so divinely beautiful  and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate  never before arrested my attention.
Landor's Cottage,the more substantial furniture consisted of a round table  a few chairs  including a large rocking chair   and a sofa  or rather  settee   its material was plain maple painted a creamy white  slightly interstriped with green  the seat of cane.
Landor's Cottage,the chairs and table were  to match   but the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which planned  the grounds   it is impossible to conceive anything more graceful.
Landor's Cottage,on the table were a few books  a large  square  crystal bottle of some novel perfume  a plain ground glass astral  not solar  lamp with an italian shade  and a large vase of resplendently blooming flowers.
Landor's Cottage,flowers  indeed  of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment.
Landor's Cottage,the fire place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium.
Landor's Cottage,on a triangular shelf in each angle of the room stood also a similar vase  varied only as to its lovely contents.
Landor's Cottage,one or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel  and late violets clustered about the open windows.
Landor's Cottage,it is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail  a picture of mr. landor    s residence as i found it.
Landor's Cottage,how he made it what it was and why with some particulars of mr. landor himself may  possibly form the subject of another article.
William Wilson, let me call myself  for the present  william wilson.
William Wilson,the fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation.
William Wilson,this has been already too much an object for the scorn for the horror for the detestation of my race.
William Wilson,to the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy  oh  outcast of all outcasts most abandoned  to the earth art thou not forever dead  to its honors  to its flowers  to its golden aspirations  and a cloud  dense  dismal  and limitless  does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven   i would not  if i could  here or to day  embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery  and unpardonable crime.
William Wilson,this epoch these later years took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude  whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign.
William Wilson,men usually grow base by degrees.
William Wilson,from me  in an instant  all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle.
William Wilson,from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed  with the stride of a giant  into more than the enormities of an elah gabalus.
William Wilson,what chance what one event brought this evil thing to pass  bear with me while i relate.
William Wilson,death approaches  and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit.
William Wilson,i long  in passing through the dim valley  for the sympathy i had nearly said for the pity of my fellow men.
William Wilson,i would fain have them believe that i have been  in some measure  the slave of circumstances beyond human control.
William Wilson,i would wish them to seek out for me  in the details i am about to give  some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error.
William Wilson,i would have them allow what they cannot refrain from allowing that  although temptation may have erewhile existed as great  man was never thus  at least  tempted before certainly  never thus fell.
William Wilson,and is it therefore that he has never thus suffered  have i not indeed been living in a dream  and am i not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions   i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable  and  in my earliest infancy  i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.
William Wilson,as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed  becoming  for many reasons  a cause of serious disquietude to my friends  and of positive injury to myself.
William Wilson,i grew self willed  addicted to the wildest caprices  and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.
William Wilson,weak minded  and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own  my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me.
William Wilson,some feeble and ill directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part  and  of course  in total triumph on mine.
William Wilson,thenceforward my voice was a household law  and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading strings  i was left to the guidance of my own will  and became  in all but name  the master of my own actions.
William Wilson,my earliest recollections of a school life  are connected with a large  rambling  elizabethan house  in a misty looking village of england  where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees  and where all the houses were excessively ancient.
William Wilson,in truth  it was a dream like and spirit soothing place  that venerable old town.
William Wilson,at this moment  in fancy  i feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply shadowed avenues  inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies  and thrill anew with undefinable delight  at the deep hollow note of the church bell  breaking  each hour  with sullen and sudden roar  upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.
William Wilson,it gives me  perhaps  as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner experience  to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns.
William Wilson,steeped in misery as i am misery  alas  only too real i shall be pardoned for seeking relief  however slight and temporary  in the weakness of a few rambling details.
William Wilson,these  moreover  utterly trivial  and even ridiculous in themselves  assume  to my fancy  adventitious importance  as connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.
William Wilson,let me then remember.
William Wilson,the house  i have said  was old and irregular.
William Wilson,the grounds were extensive  and a high and solid brick wall  topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass  encompassed the whole.
William Wilson,this prison like rampart formed the limit of our domain  beyond it we saw but thrice a week once every saturday afternoon  when  attended by two ushers  we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields and twice during sunday  when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.
William Wilson,of this church the principal of our school was pastor.
William Wilson,with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery  as  with step solemn and slow  he ascended the pulpit  this reverend man  with countenance so demurely benign  with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing  with wig so minutely powdered  so rigid and so vast   could this be he who  of late  with sour visage  and in snuffy habiliments  administered  ferule in hand  the draconian laws of the academy  oh  gigantic paradox  too utterly monstrous for solution   at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.
William Wilson,it was riveted and studded with iron bolts  and surmounted with jagged iron spikes.
William Wilson,what impressions of deep awe did it inspire  it was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned  then  in every creak of its mighty hinges  we found a plenitude of mystery a world of matter for solemn remark  or for more solemn meditation.
William Wilson,the extensive enclosure was irregular in form  having many capacious recesses.
William Wilson,of these  three or four of the largest constituted the play ground.
William Wilson,it was level  and covered with fine hard gravel.
William Wilson,i well remember it had no trees  nor benches  nor anything similar within it.
William Wilson,of course it was in the rear of the house.
William Wilson,in front lay a small parterre  planted with box and other shrubs  but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed such as a first advent to school or final departure thence  or perhaps  when a parent or friend having called for us  we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or midsummer holidays.
William Wilson,but the house  how quaint an old building was this  to me how veritably a palace of enchantment  there was really no end to its windings to its incomprehensible subdivisions.
William Wilson,it was difficult  at any given time  to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.
William Wilson,from each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.
William Wilson,then the lateral branches were innumerable inconceivable and so returning in upon themselves  that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity.
William Wilson,during the five years of my residence here  i was never able to ascertain with precision  in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.
William Wilson,the school room was the largest in the house i could not help thinking  in the world.
William Wilson,it was very long  narrow  and dismally low  with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak.
William Wilson,in a remote and terror inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet  comprising the sanctum   during hours   of our principal  the reverend dr. bransby.
William Wilson,it was a solid structure  with massy door  sooner than open which in the absence of the  dominie   we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure.
William Wilson,in other angles were two other similar boxes  far less reverenced  indeed  but still greatly matters of awe.
William Wilson,one of these was the pulpit of the  classical  usher  one of the  english and mathematical.
William Wilson,interspersed about the room  crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity  were innumerable benches and desks  black  ancient  and time worn  piled desperately with much bethumbed books  and so beseamed with initial letters  names at full length  grotesque figures  and other multiplied efforts of the knife  as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed.
William Wilson,a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room  and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.
William Wilson,encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy  i passed  yet not in tedium or disgust  the years of the third lustrum of my life.
William Wilson,the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it  and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury  or my full manhood from crime.
William Wilson,yet i must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon even much of the outr  .
William Wilson,upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression.
William Wilson,all is gray shadow a weak and irregular remembrance an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.
William Wilson,with me this is not so.
William Wilson,in childhood i must have felt with the energy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid  as deep  and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian medals.
William Wilson,yet in fact in the fact of the world    s view how little was there to remember  the morning    s awakening  the nightly summons to bed  the connings  the recitations  the periodical half holidays  and perambulations  the play ground  with its broils  its pastimes  its intrigues  these  by a mental sorcery long forgotten  were made to involve a wilderness of sensation  a world of rich incident  an universe of varied emotion  of excitement the most passionate and spirit stirring.
William Wilson,oh  le bon temps  que ce si  cle de fer    in truth  the ardor  the enthusiasm  and the imperiousness of my disposition  soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates  and by slow  but natural gradations  gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself  over all with a single exception.
William Wilson,this exception was found in the person of a scholar  who  although no relation  bore the same christian and surname as myself  a circumstance  in fact  little remarkable  for  notwithstanding a noble descent  mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem  by prescriptive right  to have been  time out of mind  the common property of the mob.
William Wilson,in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as william wilson  a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.
William Wilson,my namesake alone  of those who in school phraseology constituted  our set   presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class in the sports and broils of the play ground to refuse implicit belief in my assertions  and submission to my will indeed  to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.
William Wilson,if there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism  it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.
William Wilson,wilson    s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment  the more so as  in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions  i secretly felt that i feared him  and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself  a proof of his true superiority  since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle.
William Wilson,yet this superiority even this equality was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself  our associates  by some unaccountable blindness  seemed not even to suspect it.
William Wilson,indeed  his competition  his resistance  and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes  were not more pointed than private.
William Wilson,he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged  and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel.
William Wilson,in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart  astonish  or mortify myself  although there were times when i could not help observing  with a feeling made up of wonder  abasement  and pique  that he mingled with his injuries  his insults  or his contradictions  a certain most inappropriate  and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner.
William Wilson,i could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.
William Wilson,perhaps it was this latter trait in wilson    s conduct  conjoined with our identity of name  and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day  which set afloat the notion that we were brothers  among the senior classes in the academy.
William Wilson,these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors.
William Wilson,i have before said  or should have said  that wilson was not  in the most remote degree  connected with my family.
William Wilson,but assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins  for  after leaving dr. bransby    s  i casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january       and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence  for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.
William Wilson,it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of wilson  and his intolerable spirit of contradiction  i could not bring myself to hate him altogether.
William Wilson,we had  to be sure  nearly every day a quarrel in which  yielding me publicly the palm of victory  he  in some manner  contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it  yet a sense of pride on my part  and a veritable dignity on his own  kept us always upon what are called  speaking terms   while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers  operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone  perhaps  prevented from ripening into friendship.
William Wilson,it is difficult  indeed  to define  or even to describe  my real feelings towards him.
William Wilson,they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture  some petulant animosity  which was not yet hatred  some esteem  more respect  much fear  with a world of uneasy curiosity.
William Wilson,to the moralist it will be unnecessary to say  in addition  that wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.
William Wilson,it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us  which turned all my attacks upon him   and they were many  either open or covert  into the channel of banter or practical joke  giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun  rather than into a more serious and determined hostility.
William Wilson,but my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful  even when my plans were the most wittily concocted  for my namesake had much about him  in character  of that unassuming and quiet austerity which  while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes  has no heel of achilles in itself  and absolutely refuses to be laughed at.
William Wilson,i could find  indeed  but one vulnerable point  and that  lying in a personal peculiarity  arising  perhaps  from constitutional disease  would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit    s end than myself  my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs  which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper.
William Wilson,of this defect i did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.
William Wilson,wilson    s retaliations in kind were many  and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.
William Wilson,how his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me  is a question i never could solve  but  having discovered  he habitually practised the annoyance.
William Wilson,i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic  and its very common  if not plebeian praenomen.
William Wilson,the words were venom in my ears  and when  upon the day of my arrival  a second william wilson came also to the academy  i felt angry with him for bearing the name  and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it  who would be the cause of its twofold repetition  who would be constantly in my presence  and whose concerns  in the ordinary routine of the school business  must inevitably  on account of the detestable coincidence  be often confounded with my own.
William Wilson,the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance  moral or physical  between my rival and myself.
William Wilson,i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age  but i saw that we were of the same height  and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature.
William Wilson,i was galled  too  by the rumor touching a relationship  which had grown current in the upper forms.
William Wilson,in a word  nothing could more seriously disturb me   although i scrupulously concealed such disturbance   than any allusion to a similarity of mind  person  or condition existing between us.
William Wilson,but  in truth  i had no reason to believe that  with the exception of the matter of relationship  and in the case of wilson himself   this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment  or even observed at all by our schoolfellows.
William Wilson,that he observed it in all its bearings  and as fixedly as i  was apparent  but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance  can only be attributed  as i said before  to his more than ordinary penetration.
William Wilson,his cue  which was to perfect an imitation of myself  lay both in words and in actions  and most admirably did he play his part.
William Wilson,my dress it was an easy matter to copy  my gait and general manner were  without difficulty  appropriated  in spite of his constitutional defect  even my voice did not escape him.
William Wilson,my louder tones were  of course  unattempted  but then the key it was identical  and his singular whisper  it grew the very echo of my own.
William Wilson,how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me   for it could not justly be termed a caricature   i will not now venture to describe.
William Wilson,i had but one consolation in the fact that the imitation  apparently  was noticed by myself alone  and that i had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself.
William Wilson,satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect  he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted  and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.
William Wilson,that the school  indeed  did not feel his design  perceive its accomplishment  and participate in his sneer  was  for many anxious months  a riddle i could not resolve.
William Wilson,perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible  or  more possibly  i owed my security to the master air of the copyist  who  disdaining the letter   which in a painting is all the obtuse can see   gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.
William Wilson,i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me  and of his frequent officious interference with my will.
William Wilson,this interference often took the ungracious character of advice  advice not openly given  but hinted or insinuated.
William Wilson,i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years.
William Wilson,yet  at this distant day  let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience  that his moral sense  at least  if not his general talents and worldly wisdom  was far keener than my own  and that i might  to day  have been a better  and thus a happier man  had i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.
William Wilson,as it was  i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision  and daily resented more and more openly what i considered his intolerable arrogance.
William Wilson,i have said that  in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates  my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship  but  in the latter months of my residence at the academy  although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had  beyond doubt  in some measure  abated  my sentiments  in nearly similar proportion  partook very much of positive hatred.
William Wilson,upon one occasion he saw this  i think  and afterwards avoided  or made a show of avoiding me.
William Wilson,it was about the same period  if i remember aright  that  in an altercation of violence with him  in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard  and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature  i discovered  or fancied i discovered  in his accent  his air  and general appearance  a something which first startled  and then deeply interested me  by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy wild  confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn.
William Wilson,i cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me  at some epoch very long ago some point of the past even infinitely remote.
William Wilson,the delusion  however  faded rapidly as it came  and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular namesake.
William Wilson,the huge old house  with its countless subdivisions  had several large chambers communicating with each other  where slept the greater number of the students.
William Wilson,there were  however   as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned   many little nooks or recesses  the odds and ends of the structure  and these the economic ingenuity of dr. bransby had also fitted up as dormitories  although  being the merest closets  they were capable of accommodating but a single individual.
William Wilson,one of these small apartments was occupied by wilson.
William Wilson,one night  about the close of my fifth year at the school  and immediately after the altercation just mentioned  finding every one wrapped in sleep  i arose from bed  and  lamp in hand  stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.
William Wilson,i had long been plotting one of those ill natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.
William Wilson,it was my intention  now  to put my scheme in operation  and i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued.
William Wilson,having reached his closet  i noiselessly entered  leaving the lamp  with a shade over it  on the outside.
William Wilson,i advanced a step  and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing.
William Wilson,assured of his being asleep  i returned  took the light  and with it again approached the bed.
William Wilson,close curtains were around it  which  in the prosecution of my plan  i slowly and quietly withdrew  when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper  and my eyes  at the same moment  upon his countenance.
William Wilson,i looked  and a numbness  an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame.
William Wilson,my breast heaved  my knees tottered  my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror.
William Wilson,gasping for breath  i lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face.
William Wilson,were these these the lineaments of william wilson  i saw  indeed  that they were his  but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not.
William Wilson,what was there about them to confound me in this manner  i gazed  while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.
William Wilson,not thus he appeared assuredly not thus in the vivacity of his waking hours.
William Wilson,the same name  the same contour of person  the same day of arrival at the academy  and then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait  my voice  my habits  and my manner  was it  in truth  within the bounds of human possibility  that what i now saw was the result  merely  of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation  awe stricken  and with a creeping shudder  i extinguished the lamp  passed silently from the chamber  and left  at once  the halls of that old academy  never to enter them again.
William Wilson,after a lapse of some months  spent at home in mere idleness  i found myself a student at eton.
William Wilson,the brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr. bransby    s  or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i remembered them.
William Wilson,the truth the tragedy of the drama was no more.
William Wilson,i could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses  and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity  and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i hereditarily possessed.
William Wilson,neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton.
William Wilson,the vortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so recklessly plunged  washed away all but the froth of my past hours  engulfed at once every solid or serious impression  and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.
William Wilson,i do not wish  however  to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here a profligacy which set at defiance the laws  while it eluded the vigilance of the institution.
William Wilson,three years of folly  passed without profit  had but given me rooted habits of vice  and added  in a somewhat unusual degree  to my bodily stature  when  after a week of soulless dissipation  i invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers.
William Wilson,we met at a late hour of the night  for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning.
William Wilson,the wine flowed freely  and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions  so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east  while our delirious extravagance was at its height.
William Wilson,madly flushed with cards and intoxication  i was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity  when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent  although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment  and by the eager voice of a servant from without.
William Wilson,he said that some person  apparently in great haste  demanded to speak with me in the hall.
William Wilson,wildly excited with wine  the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me.
William Wilson,i staggered forward at once  and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building.
William Wilson,in this low and small room there hung no lamp  and now no light at all was admitted  save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi circular window.
William Wilson,as i put my foot over the threshold  i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height  and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock  cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment.
William Wilson,this the faint light enabled me to perceive  but the features of his face i could not distinguish.
William Wilson,upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me  and  seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience  whispered the words  william wilson   in my ear.
William Wilson,i grew perfectly sober in an instant.
William Wilson,there was that in the manner of the stranger  and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger  as he held it between my eyes and the light  which filled me with unqualified amazement  but it was not this which had so violently moved me.
William Wilson,it was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular  low  hissing utterance  and  above all  it was the character  the tone  the key  of those few  simple  and familiar  yet whispered syllables  which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days  and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery.
William Wilson,ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone.
William Wilson,although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination  yet was it evanescent as vivid.
William Wilson,for some weeks  indeed  i busied myself in earnest inquiry  or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation.
William Wilson,i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs  and harassed me with his insinuated counsel.
William Wilson,but who and what was this wilson  and whence came he  and what were his purposes  upon neither of these points could i be satisfied  merely ascertaining  in regard to him  that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr. bransby    s academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped.
William Wilson,but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject  my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford.
William Wilson,thither i soon went  the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment  which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart  to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in great britain.
William Wilson,excited by such appliances to vice  my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor  and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels.
William Wilson,but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance.
William Wilson,let it suffice  that among spendthrifts i out heroded herod  and that  giving name to a multitude of novel follies  i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe.
William Wilson,it could hardly be credited  however  that i had  even here  so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate  as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession  and  having become an adept in his despicable science  to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak minded among my fellow collegians.
William Wilson,such  nevertheless  was the fact.
William Wilson,and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved  beyond doubt  the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed.
William Wilson,who  indeed  among my most abandoned associates  would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses  than have suspected of such courses  the gay  the frank  the generous william wilson the noblest and most liberal commoner at oxford him whose follies  said his parasites  were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy whose errors but inimitable whim whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance   i had been now two years successfully busied in this way  when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman  glendinning rich  said report  as herodes atticus his riches  too  as easily acquired.
William Wilson,i soon found him of weak intellect  and  of course  marked him as a fitting subject for my skill.
William Wilson,i frequently engaged him in play  and contrived  with the gambler    s usual art  to let him win considerable sums  the more effectually to entangle him in my snares.
William Wilson,at length  my schemes being ripe  i met him  with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive  at the chambers of a fellow commoner   mr. preston   equally intimate with both  but who  to do him justice  entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design.
William Wilson,to give to this a better coloring  i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten  and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental  and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.
William Wilson,to be brief upon a vile topic  none of the low finesse was omitted  so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.
William Wilson,we had protracted our sitting far into the night  and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist.
William Wilson,the game  too  was my favorite   cart    the rest of the company  interested in the extent of our play  had abandoned their own cards  and were standing around us as spectators.
William Wilson,the parvenu  who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening  to drink deeply  now shuffled  dealt  or played  with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication  i thought  might partially  but could not altogether account.
William Wilson,in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount  when  having taken a long draught of port  he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipating he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.
William Wilson,with a well feigned show of reluctance  and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance  did i finally comply.
William Wilson,the result  of course  did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils  in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt.
William Wilson,for some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine  but now  to my astonishment  i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful.
William Wilson,i say to my astonishment.
William Wilson,glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy  and the sums which he had as yet lost  although in themselves vast  could not  i supposed  very seriously annoy  much less so violently affect him.
William Wilson,that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed  was the idea which most readily presented itself  and  rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates  than from any less interested motive  i was about to insist  peremptorily  upon a discontinuance of the play  when some expressions at my elbow from among the company  and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning  gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which  rendering him an object for the pity of all  should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.
William Wilson,what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.
William Wilson,the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all  and  for some moments  a profound silence was maintained  during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.
William Wilson,i will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.
William Wilson,the wide  heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open  to their full extent  with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished  as if by magic  every candle in the room.
William Wilson,their light  in dying  enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered  about my own height  and closely muffled in a cloak.
William Wilson,the darkness  however  was now total  and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst.
William Wilson,before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all  we heard the voice of the intruder.
William Wilson,gentlemen   he said  in a low  distinct  and never to be forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones   gentlemen  i make no apology for this behaviour  because in thus behaving  i am but fulfilling a duty.
William Wilson,you are  beyond doubt  uninformed of the true character of the person who has to night won at   cart   a large sum of money from lord glendinning.
William Wilson,i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.
William Wilson,please to examine  at your leisure  the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve  and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.
William Wilson,while he spoke  so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor.
William Wilson,in ceasing  he departed at once  and as abruptly as he had entered.
William Wilson,can i shall i describe my sensations  must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned  most assuredly i had little time given for reflection.
William Wilson,many hands roughly seized me upon the spot  and lights were immediately reprocured.
William Wilson,a search ensued.
William Wilson,in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in   cart    and  in the pockets of my wrapper  a number of packs  facsimiles of those used at our sittings  with the single exception that mine were of the species called  technically  arrondees  the honours being slightly convex at the ends  the lower cards slightly convex at the sides.
William Wilson,in this disposition  the dupe who cuts  as customary  at the length of the pack  will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor  while the gambler  cutting at the breadth  will  as certainly  cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.
William Wilson,any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt  or the sarcastic composure  with which it was received.
William Wilson,mr. wilson   said our host  stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs   mr. wilson  this is your property.
William Wilson,the weather was cold  and  upon quitting my own room  i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper  putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.
William Wilson,i presume it is supererogatory to seek here  eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile  for any farther evidence of your skill.
William Wilson,indeed  we have had enough.
William Wilson,you will see the necessity  i hope  of quitting oxford at all events  of quitting instantly my chambers.
William Wilson,abased  humbled to the dust as i then was  it is probable that i should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence  had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character.
William Wilson,the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur  how rare  how extravagantly costly  i shall not venture to say.
William Wilson,its fashion  too  was of my own fantastic invention  for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry  in matters of this frivolous nature.
William Wilson,when  therefore  mr. preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor  and near the folding doors of the apartment  it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror  that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm   where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it   and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every  in even the minutest possible particular.
William Wilson,the singular being who had so disastrously exposed me  had been muffled  i remembered  in a cloak  and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.
William Wilson,retaining some presence of mind  i took the one offered me by preston  placed it  unnoticed  over my own  left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance  and  next morning ere dawn of day  commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent  in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.
William Wilson,i fled in vain.
William Wilson,my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation  and proved  indeed  that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun.
William Wilson,scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns.
William Wilson,years flew  while i experienced no relief.
William Wilson,villain  at rome  with how untimely  yet with how spectral an officiousness  stepped he in between me and my ambition  at vienna  too at berlin and at moscow  where  in truth  had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart  from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee  panic stricken  as from a pestilence  and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain.
William Wilson,and again  and again  in secret communion with my own spirit  would i demand the questions  who is he  whence came he  and what are his objects   but no answer was there found.
William Wilson,and then i scrutinized  with a minute scrutiny  the forms  and the methods  and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision.
William Wilson,but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.
William Wilson,it was noticeable  indeed  that  in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path  had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes  or to disturb those actions  which  if fully carried out  might have resulted in bitter mischief.
William Wilson,poor justification this  in truth  for an authority so imperiously assumed  poor indemnity for natural rights of self agency so pertinaciously  so insultingly denied   i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor  for a very long period of time   while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself   had so contrived it  in the execution of his varied interference with my will  that i saw not  at any moment  the features of his face.
William Wilson,be wilson what he might  this  at least  was but the veriest of affectation  or of folly.
William Wilson,could he  for an instant  have supposed that  in my admonisher at eton in the destroyer of my honor at oxford  in him who thwarted my ambition at rome  my revenge at paris  my passionate love at naples  or what he falsely termed my avarice in egypt  that in this  my arch enemy and evil genius  could fail to recognise the william wilson of my school boy days  the namesake  the companion  the rival  the hated and dreaded rival at dr. bransby    s  impossible  but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.
William Wilson,thus far i had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.
William Wilson,the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character  the majestic wisdom  the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson  added to a feeling of even terror  with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me  had operated  hitherto  to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness  and to suggest an implicit  although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.
William Wilson,but  of late days  i had given myself up entirely to wine  and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control.
William Wilson,i began to murmur  to hesitate  to resist.
William Wilson,and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that  with the increase of my own firmness  that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution  be this as it may  i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope  and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved.
William Wilson,it was at rome  during the carnival of      that i attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio.
William Wilson,i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine table  and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance.
William Wilson,the difficulty  too  of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper  for i was anxiously seeking   let me not say with what unworthy motive  the young  the gay  the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio.
William Wilson,with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited  and now  having caught a glimpse of her person  i was hurrying to make my way into her presence.
William Wilson,at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder  and that ever remembered  low  damnable whisper within my ear.
William Wilson,in an absolute phrenzy of wrath  i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me  and seized him violently by the collar.
William Wilson,he was attired  as i had expected  in a costume altogether similar to my own  wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet  begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier.
William Wilson,a mask of black silk entirely covered his face.
William Wilson,scoundrel   i said  in a voice husky with rage  while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury   scoundrel  impostor  accursed villain  you shall not you shall not dog me unto death  follow me  or i stab you where you stand   and i broke my way from the ball room into a small ante chamber adjoining  dragging him unresistingly with me as i went.
William Wilson,upon entering  i thrust him furiously from me.
William Wilson,he staggered against the wall  while i closed the door with an oath  and commanded him to draw.
William Wilson,he hesitated but for an instant  then  with a slight sigh  drew in silence  and put himself upon his defence.
William Wilson,the contest was brief indeed.
William Wilson,i was frantic with every species of wild excitement  and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude.
William Wilson,in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting  and thus  getting him at mercy  plunged my sword  with brute ferocity  repeatedly through and through his bosom.
William Wilson,at that instant some person tried the latch of the door.
William Wilson,i hastened to prevent an intrusion  and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist.
William Wilson,but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment  that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view  the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce  apparently  a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room.
William Wilson,a large mirror  so at first it seemed to me in my confusion now stood where none had been perceptible before  and  as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror  mine own image  but with features all pale and dabbled in blood  advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.
William Wilson,thus it appeared  i say  but was not.
William Wilson,it was my antagonist it was wilson  who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.
William Wilson,his mask and cloak lay  where he had thrown them  upon the floor.
William Wilson,not a thread in all his raiment not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not  even in the most absolute identity  mine own   it was wilson  but he spoke no longer in a whisper  and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said    you have conquered  and i yield.
William Wilson,yet  henceforward art thou also dead dead to the world  to heaven and to hope  in me didst thou exist and  in my death  see by this image  which is thine own  how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.
The Tell-Tale Heart, true  nervous very  very dreadfully nervous i had been and am  but why will you say that i am mad  the disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them.
The Tell-Tale Heart,above all was the sense of hearing acute.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i heard many things in hell.
The Tell-Tale Heart,how  then  am i mad  hearken  and observe how healthily how calmly i can tell you the whole story.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain  but once conceived  it haunted me day and night.
The Tell-Tale Heart,object there was none.
The Tell-Tale Heart,passion there was none.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i loved the old man.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had never wronged me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had never given me insult.
The Tell-Tale Heart,for his gold i had no desire.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i think it was his eye  yes  it was this  he had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye  with a film over it.
The Tell-Tale Heart,whenever it fell upon me  my blood ran cold  and so by degrees very gradually i made up my mind to take the life of the old man  and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
The Tell-Tale Heart,now this is the point.
The Tell-Tale Heart,you fancy me mad.
The Tell-Tale Heart,madmen know nothing.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but you should have seen me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,you should have seen how wisely i proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation i went to work  i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and every night  about midnight  i turned the latch of his door and opened it oh  so gently  and then  when i had made an opening sufficient for my head  i put in a dark lantern  all closed  closed  that no light shone out  and then i thrust in my head.
The Tell-Tale Heart,oh  you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in  i moved it slowly very  very slowly  so that i might not disturb the old man    s sleep.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,ha  would a madman have been so wise as this  and then  when my head was well in the room  i undid the lantern cautiously oh  so cautiously cautiously  for the hinges creaked  i undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and this i did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but i found the eye always closed  and so it was impossible to do the work  for it was not the old man who vexed me  but his evil eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and every morning  when the day broke  i went boldly into the chamber  and spoke courageously to him  calling him by name in a hearty tone  and inquiring how he has passed the night.
The Tell-Tale Heart,so you see he would have been a very profound old man  indeed  to suspect that every night  just at twelve  i looked in upon him while he slept.
The Tell-Tale Heart,upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a watch    s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.
The Tell-Tale Heart,never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.
The Tell-Tale Heart,to think that there i was  opening the door  little by little  and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i fairly chuckled at the idea  and perhaps he heard me  for he moved on the bed suddenly  as if startled.
The Tell-Tale Heart,now you may think that i drew back but no.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness   for the shutters were close fastened  through fear of robbers   and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door  and i kept pushing it on steadily  steadily.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i had my head in  and was about to open the lantern  when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening  and the old man sprang up in bed  crying out  who    s there    i kept quite still and said nothing.
The Tell-Tale Heart,for a whole hour i did not move a muscle  and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he was still sitting up in the bed listening  just as i have done  night after night  hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
The Tell-Tale Heart,presently i heard a slight groan  and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh  no  it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew the sound well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,many a night  just at midnight  when all the world slept  it has welled up from my own bosom  deepening  with its dreadful echo  the terrors that distracted me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i say i knew it well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew what the old man felt  and pitied him  although i chuckled at heart.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise  when he had turned in the bed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his fears had been ever since growing upon him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had been trying to fancy them causeless  but could not.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had been saying to himself  it is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor   or  it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yes  he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions  but he had found all in vain.
The Tell-Tale Heart,all in vain  because death  in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him  and enveloped the victim.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room.
The Tell-Tale Heart,when i had waited a long time  very patiently  without hearing him lie down  i resolved to open a little a very  very little crevice in the lantern.
The Tell-Tale Heart,so i opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily  stealthily until  at length a simple dim ray  like the thread of the spider  shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was open wide  wide open and i grew furious as i gazed upon it.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue  with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones  but i could see nothing else of the old man    s face or person  for i had directed the ray as if by instinct  precisely upon the damned spot.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the sense  now  i say  there came to my ears a low  dull  quick sound  such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew that sound well  too.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was the beating of the old man    s heart.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it increased my fury  as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but even yet i refrained and kept still.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i scarcely breathed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i held the lantern motionless.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it grew quicker and quicker  and louder and louder every instant.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man    s terror must have been extreme  it grew louder  i say  louder every moment  do you mark me well  i have told you that i am nervous  so i am.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and now at the dead hour of the night  amid the dreadful silence of that old house  so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yet  for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but the beating grew louder  louder  i thought the heart must burst.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and now a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbour  the old man    s hour had come  with a loud yell  i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he shrieked once once only.
The Tell-Tale Heart,in an instant i dragged him to the floor  and pulled the heavy bed over him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then smiled gaily  to find the deed so far done.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but  for many minutes  the heart beat on with a muffled sound.
The Tell-Tale Heart,this  however  did not vex me  it would not be heard through the wall.
The Tell-Tale Heart,at length it ceased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man was dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i removed the bed and examined the corpse.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yes  he was stone  stone dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.
The Tell-Tale Heart,there was no pulsation.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he was stone dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his eye would trouble me no more.
The Tell-Tale Heart,if still you think me mad  you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the night waned  and i worked hastily  but in silence.
The Tell-Tale Heart,first of all i dismembered the corpse.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber  and deposited all between the scantlings.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then replaced the boards so cleverly  so cunningly  that no human eye not even his could have detected any thing wrong.
The Tell-Tale Heart,there was nothing to wash out no stain of any kind no blood spot whatever.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i had been too wary for that.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a tub had caught all ha  ha   when i had made an end of these labors  it was four o    clock still dark as midnight.
The Tell-Tale Heart,as the bell sounded the hour  there came a knocking at the street door.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i went down to open it with a light heart  for what had i now to fear  there entered three men  who introduced themselves  with perfect suavity  as officers of the police.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night  suspicion of foul play had been aroused  information had been lodged at the police office  and they  the officers  had been deputed to search the premises.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i smiled  for what had i to fear  i bade the gentlemen welcome.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the shriek  i said  was my own in a dream.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man  i mentioned  was absent in the country.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i took my visitors all over the house.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i bade them search search well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i led them  at length  to his chamber.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i showed them his treasures  secure  undisturbed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,in the enthusiasm of my confidence  i brought chairs into the room  and desired them here to rest from their fatigues  while i myself  in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph  placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the officers were satisfied.
The Tell-Tale Heart,my manner had convinced them.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i was singularly at ease.
The Tell-Tale Heart,they sat  and while i answered cheerily  they chatted of familiar things.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but  ere long  i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.
The Tell-Tale Heart,my head ached  and i fancied a ringing in my ears  but still they sat and still chatted.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the ringing became more distinct  it continued and became more distinct  i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling  but it continued and gained definiteness until  at length  i found that the noise was not within my ears.
The Tell-Tale Heart,no doubt i now grew very pale  but i talked more fluently  and with a heightened voice.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yet the sound increased and what could i do  it was a low  dull  quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i talked more quickly more vehemently  but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i arose and argued about trifles  in a high key and with violent gesticulations  but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,why would they not be gone  i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides  as if excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,oh god  what could i do  i foamed i raved i swore  i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting  and grated it upon the boards  but the noise arose over all and continually increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it grew louder louder louder  and still the men chatted pleasantly  and smiled.
The Tell-Tale Heart,was it possible they heard not  almighty god  no  no  they heard  they suspected  they knew  they were making a mockery of my horror  this i thought  and this i think.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but anything was better than this agony  anything was more tolerable than this derision  i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer  i felt that i must scream or die  and now again  hark  louder  louder  louder  louder    villains   i shrieked   dissemble no more  i admit the deed  tear up the planks  here  here  it is the beating of his hideous heart
Bernice, misery is manifold.
Bernice,the wretchedness of earth is multiform.
Bernice,overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow  its hues are as various as the hues of that arch as distinct too  yet as intimately blended.
Bernice,overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow  how is it that from beauty i have derived a type of unloveliness  from the covenant of peace  a simile of sorrow  but as  in ethics  evil is a consequence of good  so  in fact  out of joy is sorrow born.
Bernice,either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to day  or the agonies which are  have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.
Bernice,my baptismal name is egaeus  that of my family i will not mention.
Bernice,yet there are no towers in the land more time honored than my gloomy  gray  hereditary halls.
Bernice,our line has been called a race of visionaries  and in many striking particulars in the character of the family mansion in the frescos of the chief saloon in the tapestries of the dormitories in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings in the fashion of the library chamber and  lastly  in the very peculiar nature of the library    s contents there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.
Bernice,the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber  and with its volumes of which latter i will say no more.
Bernice,here died my mother.
Bernice,herein was i born.
Bernice,but it is mere idleness to say that i had not lived before that the soul has no previous existence.
Bernice,you deny it  let us not argue the matter.
Bernice,convinced myself  i seek not to convince.
Bernice,there is  however  a remembrance of aerial forms of spiritual and meaning eyes of sounds  musical yet sad a remembrance which will not be excluded  a memory like a shadow vague  variable  indefinite  unsteady  and like a shadow  too  in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.
Bernice,in that chamber was i born.
Bernice,thus awaking from the long night of what seemed  but was not  nonentity  at once into the very regions of fairy land into a palace of imagination into the wild dominions of monastic thought and erudition it is not singular that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye that i loitered away my boyhood in books  and dissipated my youth in reverie  but it is singular that as years rolled away  and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought.
Bernice,the realities of the world affected me as visions  and as visions only  while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became  in turn  not the material of my every day existence  but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.
Bernice,berenice and i were cousins  and we grew up together in my paternal halls.
Bernice,yet differently we grew i  ill of health  and buried in gloom she  agile  graceful  and overflowing with energy  hers  the ramble on the hill side mine the studies of the cloister  i  living within my own heart  and addicted  body and soul  to the most intense and painful meditation she  roaming carelessly through life  with no thought of the shadows in her path  or the silent flight of the raven winged hours.
Bernice,berenice  i call upon her name berenice  and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound  ah  vividly is her image before me now  as in the early days of her light heartedness and joy  oh  gorgeous yet fantastic beauty  oh  sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim  oh  naiad among its fountains  and then then all is mystery and terror  and a tale which should not be told.
Bernice,disease a fatal disease  fell like the simoon upon her frame  and  even while i gazed upon her  the spirit of change swept over her  pervading her mind  her habits  and her character  and  in a manner the most subtle and terrible  disturbing even the identity of her person  alas  the destroyer came and went  and the victim where is she  i knew her not or knew her no longer as berenice.
Bernice,among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin  may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature  a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution  and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances  startlingly abrupt.
Bernice,in the mean time my own disease for i have been told that i should call it by no other appellation my own disease  then  grew rapidly upon me  and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form hourly and momently gaining vigor and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy.
Bernice,this monomania  if i must so term it  consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive.
Bernice,it is more than probable that i am not understood  but i fear  indeed  that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader  an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which  in my case  the powers of meditation  not to speak technically  busied and buried themselves  in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.
Bernice,to muse for long unwearied hours  with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin  or in the typography of a book  to become absorbed  for the better part of a summer    s day  in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor  to lose myself  for an entire night  in watching the steady flame of a lamp  or the embers of a fire  to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower  to repeat  monotonously  some common word  until the sound  by dint of frequent repetition  ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind  to lose all sense of motion or physical existence  by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in  such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties  not  indeed  altogether unparalleled  but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.
Bernice,yet let me not be misapprehended.
Bernice,the undue  earnest  and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous  must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind  and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination.
Bernice,it was not even  as might be at first supposed  an extreme condition  or exaggeration of such propensity  but primarily and essentially distinct and different.
Bernice,in the one instance  the dreamer  or enthusiast  being interested by an object usually not frivolous  imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom  until  at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury  he finds the incitamentum  or first cause of his musings  entirely vanished and forgotten.
Bernice,in my case  the primary object was invariably frivolous  although assuming  through the medium of my distempered vision  a refracted and unreal importance.
Bernice,few deductions  if any  were made  and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre.
Bernice,the meditations were never pleasurable  and  at the termination of the reverie  the first cause  so far from being out of sight  had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease.
Bernice,in a word  the powers of mind more particularly exercised were  with me  as i have said before  the attentive  and are  with the day dreamer  the speculative.
Bernice,my books  at this epoch  if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder  partook  it will be perceived  largely  in their imaginative and inconsequential nature  of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself.
Bernice,i well remember  among others  the treatise of the noble italian  coelius secundus curio   de amplitudine beati regni dei   st. austin    s great work  the  city of god   and tertullian    s  de carne christi   in which the paradoxical sentence  mortuus est dei filius  credible est quia ineptum est  et sepultus resurrexit  certum est quia impossibile est   occupied my undivided time  for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.
Bernice,thus it will appear that  shaken from its balance only by trivial things  my reason bore resemblance to that ocean crag spoken of by ptolemy hephestion  which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence  and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds  trembled only to the touch of the flower called asphodel.
Bernice,and although  to a careless thinker  it might appear a matter beyond doubt  that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady  in the moral condition of berenice  would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature i have been at some trouble in explaining  yet such was not in any degree the case.
Bernice,in the lucid intervals of my infirmity  her calamity  indeed  gave me pain  and  taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life  i did not fail to ponder  frequently and bitterly  upon the wonder working means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass.
Bernice,but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease  and were such as would have occurred  under similar circumstances  to the ordinary mass of mankind.
Bernice,true to its own character  my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of berenice in the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.
Bernice,during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty  most surely i had never loved her.
Bernice,in the strange anomaly of my existence  feelings with me  had never been of the heart  and my passions always were of the mind.
Bernice,through the gray of the early morning among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday and in the silence of my library at night she had flitted by my eyes  and i had seen her not as the living and breathing berenice  but as the berenice of a dream  not as a being of the earth  earthy  but as the abstraction of such a being  not as a thing to admire  but to analyze  not as an object of love  but as the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation.
Bernice,and now now i shuddered in her presence  and grew pale at her approach  yet  bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition  i called to mind that she had loved me long  and  in an evil moment  i spoke to her of marriage.
Bernice,and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching  when  upon an afternoon in the winter of the year one of those unseasonably warm  calm  and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful halcyon       i sat   and sat  as i thought  alone   in the inner apartment of the library.
Bernice,but  uplifting my eyes  i saw that berenice stood before me.
Bernice,was it my own excited imagination or the misty influence of the atmosphere or the uncertain twilight of the chamber or the gray draperies which fell around her figure that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline  i could not tell.
Bernice,she spoke no word  and i not for worlds could i have uttered a syllable.
Bernice,an icy chill ran through my frame  a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me  a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul  and sinking back upon the chair  i remained for some time breathless and motionless  with my eyes riveted upon her person.
Bernice,alas  its emaciation was excessive  and not one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour.
Bernice,my burning glances at length fell upon the face.
Bernice,the forehead was high  and very pale  and singularly placid  and the once jetty hair fell partially over it  and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets  now of a vivid yellow  and jarring discordantly  in their fantastic character  with the reigning melancholy of the countenance.
Bernice,the eyes were lifeless  and lustreless  and seemingly pupilless  and i shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips.
Bernice,they parted  and in a smile of peculiar meaning  the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my view.
Bernice,would to god that i had never beheld them  or that  having done so  i had died   the shutting of a door disturbed me  and  looking up  i found that my cousin had departed from the chamber.
Bernice,but from the disordered chamber of my brain  had not  alas  departed  and would not be driven away  the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth.
Bernice,not a speck on their surface not a shade on their enamel not an indenture in their edges but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory.
Bernice,i saw them now even more unequivocally than i beheld them then.
Bernice,the teeth  the teeth  they were here  and there  and everywhere  and visibly and palpably before me  long  narrow  and excessively white  with the pale lips writhing about them  as in the very moment of their first terrible development.
Bernice,then came the full fury of my monomania  and i struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence.
Bernice,in the multiplied objects of the external world i had no thoughts but for the teeth.
Bernice,for these i longed with a phrenzied desire.
Bernice,all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation.
Bernice,they they alone were present to the mental eye  and they  in their sole individuality  became the essence of my mental life.
Bernice,i held them in every light.
Bernice,i turned them in every attitude.
Bernice,i surveyed their characteristics.
Bernice,i dwelt upon their peculiarities.
Bernice,i pondered upon their conformation.
Bernice,i mused upon the alteration in their nature.
Bernice,i shuddered as i assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power  and even when unassisted by the lips  a capability of moral expression.
Bernice,of mademoiselle salle it has been well said   que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments   and of berenice i more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des id  es.
Bernice,des id  es  ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me  des id  es  ah  therefore it was that i coveted them so madly  i felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace  in giving me back to reason.
Bernice,and the evening closed in upon me thus and then the darkness came  and tarried  and went and the day again dawned and the mists of a second night were now gathering around and still i sat motionless in that solitary room and still i sat buried in meditation and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy  as  with the most vivid hideous distinctness  it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber.
Bernice,at length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay  and thereunto  after a pause  succeeded the sound of troubled voices  intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow or of pain.
Bernice,i arose from my seat  and throwing open one of the doors of the library  saw standing out in the ante chamber a servant maiden  all in tears  who told me that berenice was no more  she had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning  and now  at the closing in of the night  the grave was ready for its tenant  and all the preparations for the burial were completed.
Bernice,i found myself sitting in the library  and again sitting there alone.
Bernice,it seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.
Bernice,i knew that it was now midnight  and i was well aware  that since the setting of the sun  berenice had been interred.
Bernice,but of that dreary period which intervened i had no positive  at least no definite comprehension.
Bernice,yet its memory was replete with horror horror more horrible from being vague  and terror more terrible from ambiguity.
Bernice,it was a fearful page in the record my existence  written all over with dim  and hideous  and unintelligible recollections.
Bernice,i strived to decypher them  but in vain  while ever and anon  like the spirit of a departed sound  the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears.
Bernice,i had done a deed what was it  i asked myself the question aloud  and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered me   what was it    on the table beside me burned a lamp  and near it lay a little box.
Bernice,it was of no remarkable character  and i had seen it frequently before  for it was the property of the family physician  but how came it there  upon my table  and why did i shudder in regarding it  these things were in no manner to be accounted for  and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book  and to a sentence underscored therein.
Bernice,the words were the singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiat   dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem  curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.
Bernice,why then  as i perused them  did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end  and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins   there came a light tap at the library door and  pale as the tenant of a tomb  a menial entered upon tiptoe.
Bernice,his looks were wild with terror  and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous  husky  and very low.
Bernice,what said he  some broken sentences i heard.
Bernice,he told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night of the gathering together of the household of a search in the direction of the sound  and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave of a disfigured body enshrouded  yet still breathing still palpitating still alive   he pointed to garments  they were muddy and clotted with gore.
Bernice,i spoke not  and he took me gently by the hand  it was indented with the impress of human nails.
Bernice,he directed my attention to some object against the wall.
Bernice,i looked at it for some minutes  it was a spade.
Bernice,with a shriek i bounded to the table  and grasped the box that lay upon it.
Bernice,but i could not force it open  and in my tremor  it slipped from my hands  and fell heavily  and burst into pieces  and from it  with a rattling sound  there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery  intermingled with thirty two small  white and ivory looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor.
Eleonora, i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion.
Eleonora,men have called me mad  but the question is not yet settled  whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence   whether much that is glorious   whether all that is profound   does not spring from disease of thought   from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.
Eleonora,they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.
Eleonora,in their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity  and thrill  in awakening  to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.
Eleonora,in snatches  they learn something of the wisdom which is of good  and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.
Eleonora,they penetrate  however  rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the    light ineffable    and again  like the adventures of the nubian geographer     agressi sunt mare tenebrarum  quid in eo esset exploraturi.
Eleonora,we will say  then  that i am mad.
Eleonora,i grant  at least  that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence   the condition of a lucid reason  not to be disputed  and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life   and a condition of shadow and doubt  appertaining to the present  and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being.
Eleonora,therefore  what i shall tell of the earlier period  believe  and to what i may relate of the later time  give only such credit as may seem due  or doubt it altogether  or  if doubt it ye cannot  then play unto its riddle the oedipus.
Eleonora,she whom i loved in youth  and of whom i now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances  was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed.
Eleonora,eleonora was the name of my cousin.
Eleonora,we had always dwelled together  beneath a tropical sun  in the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,no unguided footstep ever came upon that vale  for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it  shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses.
Eleonora,no path was trodden in its vicinity  and  to reach our happy home  there was need of putting back  with force  the foliage of many thousands of forest trees  and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers.
Eleonora,thus it was that we lived all alone  knowing nothing of the world without the valley   i  and my cousin  and her mother.
Eleonora,from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain  there crept out a narrow and deep river  brighter than all save the eyes of eleonora  and  winding stealthily about in mazy courses  it passed away  at length  through a shadowy gorge  among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued.
Eleonora,we called it the    river of silence    for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.
Eleonora,no murmur arose from its bed  and so gently it wandered along  that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze  far down within its bosom  stirred not at all  but lay in a motionless content  each in its own old station  shining on gloriously forever.
Eleonora,the margin of the river  and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel  as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom    these spots  not less than the whole surface of the valley  from the river to the mountains that girdled it in  were carpeted all by a soft green grass  thick  short  perfectly even  and vanilla perfumed  but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup  the white daisy  the purple violet  and the ruby red asphodel  that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones  of the love and of the glory of god.
Eleonora,and  here and there  in groves about this grass  like wildernesses of dreams  sprang up fantastic trees  whose tall slender stems stood not upright  but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon day into the centre of the valley.
Eleonora,their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver  and was smoother than all save the cheeks of eleonora  so that  but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long  tremulous lines  dallying with the zephyrs  one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun.
Eleonora,hand in hand about this valley  for fifteen years  roamed i with eleonora before love entered within our hearts.
Eleonora,it was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life  and of the fourth of my own  that we sat  locked in each other   s embrace  beneath the serpent like trees  and looked down within the water of the river of silence at our images therein.
Eleonora,we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day  and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few.
Eleonora,we had drawn the god eros from that wave  and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers.
Eleonora,the passions which had for centuries distinguished our race  came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted  and together breathed a delirious bliss over the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,a change fell upon all things.
Eleonora,strange  brilliant flowers  star shaped  burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before.
Eleonora,the tints of the green carpet deepened  and when  one by one  the white daisies shrank away  there sprang up in place of them  ten by ten of the ruby red asphodel.
Eleonora,and life arose in our paths  for the tall flamingo  hitherto unseen  with all gay glowing birds  flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.
Eleonora,the golden and silver fish haunted the river  out of the bosom of which issued  little by little  a murmur that swelled  at length  into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of   olus   sweeter than all save the voice of eleonora.
Eleonora,and now  too  a voluminous cloud  which we had long watched in the regions of hesper  floated out thence  all gorgeous in crimson and gold  and settling in peace above us  sank  day by day  lower and lower  until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains  turning all their dimness into magnificence  and shutting us up  as if forever  within a magic prison house of grandeur and of glory.
Eleonora,the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim  but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.
Eleonora,no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart  and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the valley of the many colored grass  and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.
Eleonora,at length  having spoken one day  in tears  of the last sad change which must befall humanity  she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme  interweaving it into all our converse  as  in the songs of the bard of schiraz  the same images are found occurring  again and again  in every impressive variation of phrase.
Eleonora,she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom   that  like the ephemeron  she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die  but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me  one evening at twilight  by the banks of the river of silence.
Eleonora,she grieved to think that  having entombed her in the valley of the many colored grass  i would quit forever its happy recesses  transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world.
Eleonora,and  then and there  i threw myself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora  and offered up a vow  to herself and to heaven  that i would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of earth   that i would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory  or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.
Eleonora,and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow.
Eleonora,and the curse which i invoked of him and of her  a saint in helusion should i prove traitorous to that promise  involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here.
Eleonora,and the bright eyes of eleonora grew brighter at my words  and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast  and she trembled and very bitterly wept  but she made acceptance of the vow   for what was she but a child   and it made easy to her the bed of her death.
Eleonora,and she said to me  not many days afterward  tranquilly dying  that  because of what i had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed  and  if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night  but  if this thing were  indeed  beyond the power of the souls in paradise  that she would  at least  give me frequent indications of her presence  sighing upon me in the evening winds  or filling the air which i breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.
Eleonora,and  with these words upon her lips  she yielded up her innocent life  putting an end to the first epoch of my own.
Eleonora,thus far i have faithfully said.
Eleonora,but as i pass the barrier in time   s path  formed by the death of my beloved  and proceed with the second era of my existence  i feel that a shadow gathers over my brain  and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record.
Eleonora,but let me on.
Eleonora,years dragged themselves along heavily  and still i dwelled within the valley of the many colored grass  but a second change had come upon all things.
Eleonora,the star shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees  and appeared no more.
Eleonora,the tints of the green carpet faded  and  one by one  the ruby red asphodels withered away  and there sprang up  in place of them  ten by ten  dark  eye like violets  that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew.
Eleonora,and life departed from our paths  for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us  but flew sadly from the vale into the hills  with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company.
Eleonora,and the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.
Eleonora,and the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind harp of   olus  and more divine than all save the voice of eleonora  it died little by little away  in murmurs growing lower and lower  until the stream returned  at length  utterly  into the solemnity of its original silence.
Eleonora,and then  lastly  the voluminous cloud uprose  and  abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old  fell back into the regions of hesper  and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten  for i heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels  and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley  and at lone hours  when my heart beat heavily  the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs  and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air  and once   oh  but once only  i was awakened from a slumber  like the slumber of death  by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
Eleonora,but the void within my heart refused  even thus  to be filled.
Eleonora,i longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing.
Eleonora,at length the valley pained me through its memories of eleonora  and i left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.
Eleonora,i found myself within a strange city  where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed so long in the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,the pomps and pageantries of a stately court  and the mad clangor of arms  and the radiant loveliness of women  bewildered and intoxicated my brain.
Eleonora,but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows  and the indications of the presence of eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night.
Eleonora,suddenly these manifestations they ceased  and the world grew dark before mine eyes  and i stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed  at the terrible temptations which beset me  for there came from some far  far distant and unknown land  into the gay court of the king i served  a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once   at whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle  in the most ardent  in the most abject worship of love.
Eleonora,what  indeed  was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor  and the delirium  and the spirit lifting ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengarde    oh  bright was the seraph ermengarde  and in that knowledge i had room for none other.
Eleonora,oh  divine was the angel ermengarde  and as i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes  i thought only of them   and of her.
Eleonora,i wedded   nor dreaded the curse i had invoked  and its bitterness was not visited upon me.
Eleonora,and once   but once again in the silence of the night  there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me  and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice  saying      sleep in peace  for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth  and  in taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde  thou art absolved  for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven  of thy vows unto eleonora.
Frankenstein, you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.
Frankenstein,i arrived here yesterday  and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
Frankenstein,i am already far north of london  and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh  i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks  which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.
Frankenstein,do you understand this feeling  this breeze  which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing  gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Frankenstein,inspirited by this wind of promise  my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.
Frankenstein,i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation  it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.
Frankenstein,there  margaret  the sun is for ever visible  its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
Frankenstein,there   for with your leave  my sister  i will put some trust in preceding navigators   there snow and frost are banished  and  sailing over a calm sea  we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.
Frankenstein,its productions and features may be without example  as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.
Frankenstein,what may not be expected in a country of eternal light  i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.
Frankenstein,i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited  and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.
Frankenstein,these are my enticements  and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat  with his holiday mates  on an expedition of discovery up his native river.
Frankenstein,but supposing all these conjectures to be false  you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind  to the last generation  by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries  to reach which at present so many months are requisite  or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet  which  if at all possible  can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
Frankenstein,these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter  and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven  for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose   a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
Frankenstein,this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.
Frankenstein,i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole.
Frankenstein,you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas    library.
Frankenstein,my education was neglected  yet i was passionately fond of reading.
Frankenstein,these volumes were my study day and night  and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt  as a child  on learning that my father   s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
Frankenstein,these visions faded when i perused  for the first time  those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.
Frankenstein,i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation  i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated.
Frankenstein,you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment.
Frankenstein,but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin  and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
Frankenstein,six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking.
Frankenstein,i can  even now  remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise.
Frankenstein,i commenced by inuring my body to hardship.
Frankenstein,i accompanied the whale fishers on several expeditions to the north sea  i voluntarily endured cold  famine  thirst  and want of sleep  i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics  the theory of medicine  and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.
Frankenstein,twice i actually hired myself as an under mate in a greenland whaler  and acquitted myself to admiration.
Frankenstein,i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness  so valuable did he consider my services.
Frankenstein,and now  dear margaret  do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose  my life might have been passed in ease and luxury  but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.
Frankenstein,oh  that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative  my courage and my resolution is firm  but my hopes fluctuate  and my spirits are often depressed.
Frankenstein,i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage  the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude  i am required not only to raise the spirits of others  but sometimes to sustain my own  when theirs are failing.
Frankenstein,this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia.
Frankenstein,they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges  the motion is pleasant  and  in my opinion  far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach.
Frankenstein,the cold is not excessive  if you are wrapped in furs   a dress which i have already adopted  for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours  when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.
Frankenstein,i have no ambition to lose my life on the post road between st. petersburgh and archangel.
Frankenstein,i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks  and my intention is to hire a ship there  which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner  and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale fishing.
Frankenstein,i do not intend to sail until the month of june  and when shall i return  ah  dear sister  how can i answer this question  if i succeed  many  many months  perhaps years  will pass before you and i may meet.
Frankenstein,if i fail  you will see me again soon  or never.
Frankenstein,farewell  my dear  excellent margaret.
Frankenstein,heaven shower down blessings on you  and save me  that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.
Frankenstein,how slowly the time passes here  encompassed as i am by frost and snow  yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.
Frankenstein,i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors  those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
Frankenstein,but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy  and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil  i have no friend  margaret  when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success  there will be none to participate my joy  if i am assailed by disappointment  no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.
Frankenstein,i shall commit my thoughts to paper  it is true  but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.
Frankenstein,i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me  whose eyes would reply to mine.
Frankenstein,you may deem me romantic  my dear sister  but i bitterly feel the want of a friend.
Frankenstein,i have no one near me  gentle yet courageous  possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind  whose tastes are like my own  to approve or amend my plans.
Frankenstein,how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother  i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.
Frankenstein,but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self educated  for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas    books of voyages.
Frankenstein,at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country  but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.
Frankenstein,now i am twenty eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.
Frankenstein,it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent  but they want  as the painters call it  keeping  and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic  and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.
Frankenstein,well  these are useless complaints  i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean  nor even here in archangel  among merchants and seamen.
Frankenstein,yet some feelings  unallied to the dross of human nature  beat even in these rugged bosoms.
Frankenstein,my lieutenant  for instance  is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise  he is madly desirous of glory  or rather  to word my phrase more characteristically  of advancement in his profession.
Frankenstein,he is an englishman  and in the midst of national and professional prejudices  unsoftened by cultivation  retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.
Frankenstein,i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel  finding that he was unemployed in this city  i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
Frankenstein,the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.
Frankenstein,this circumstance  added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage  made me very desirous to engage him.
Frankenstein,a youth passed in solitude  my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage  has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship  i have never believed it to be necessary  and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew  i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.
Frankenstein,i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner  from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.
Frankenstein,this  briefly  is his story.
Frankenstein,some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune  and having amassed a considerable sum in prize money  the father of the girl consented to the match.
Frankenstein,he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony  but she was bathed in tears  and throwing herself at his feet  entreated him to spare her  confessing at the same time that she loved another  but that he was poor  and that her father would never consent to the union.
Frankenstein,my generous friend reassured the suppliant  and on being informed of the name of her lover  instantly abandoned his pursuit.
Frankenstein,he had already bought a farm with his money  on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life  but he bestowed the whole on his rival  together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock  and then himself solicited the young woman   s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.
Frankenstein,but the old man decidedly refused  thinking himself bound in honour to my friend  who  when he found the father inexorable  quitted his country  nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.
Frankenstein,what a noble fellow    you will exclaim.
Frankenstein,he is so  but then he is wholly uneducated  he is as silent as a turk  and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him  which  while it renders his conduct the more astonishing  detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.
Frankenstein,yet do not suppose  because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know  that i am wavering in my resolutions.
Frankenstein,those are as fixed as fate  and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.
Frankenstein,the winter has been dreadfully severe  but the spring promises well  and it is considered as a remarkably early season  so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected.
Frankenstein,i shall do nothing rashly  you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
Frankenstein,i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.
Frankenstein,it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation  half pleasurable and half fearful  with which i am preparing to depart.
Frankenstein,i am going to unexplored regions  to    the land of mist and snow    but i shall kill no albatross  therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the    ancient mariner.
Frankenstein,you will smile at my allusion  but i will disclose a secret.
Frankenstein,i have often attributed my attachment to  my passionate enthusiasm for  the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.
Frankenstein,there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand.
Frankenstein,i am practically industrious   painstaking  a workman to execute with perseverance and labour   but besides this there is a love for the marvellous  a belief in the marvellous  intertwined in all my projects  which hurries me out of the common pathways of men  even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore.
Frankenstein,but to return to dearer considerations.
Frankenstein,shall i meet you again  after having traversed immense seas  and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america  i dare not expect such success  yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.
Frankenstein,continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity  i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits.
Frankenstein,i love you very tenderly.
Frankenstein,remember me with affection  should you never hear from me again.
Frankenstein,my dear sister   i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe   and well advanced on my voyage.
Frankenstein,this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel  more fortunate than i  who may not see my native land  perhaps  for many years.
Frankenstein,i am  however  in good spirits  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose  nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us  indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing  appear to dismay them.
Frankenstein,we have already reached a very high latitude  but it is the height of summer  and although not so warm as in england  the southern gales  which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain  breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected.
Frankenstein,no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.
Frankenstein,one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record  and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
Frankenstein,adieu  my dear margaret.
Frankenstein,be assured that for my own sake  as well as yours  i will not rashly encounter danger.
Frankenstein,i will be cool  persevering  and prudent.
Frankenstein,but success shall crown my endeavours.
Frankenstein,wherefore not  thus far i have gone  tracing a secure way over the pathless seas  the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.
Frankenstein,why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element  what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man   my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.
Frankenstein,but i must finish.
Frankenstein,heaven bless my beloved sister   so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it  although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.
Frankenstein,last monday  july   st  we were nearly surrounded by ice  which closed in the ship on all sides  scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated.
Frankenstein,our situation was somewhat dangerous  especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.
Frankenstein,we accordingly lay to  hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
Frankenstein,about two o   clock the mist cleared away  and we beheld  stretched out in every direction  vast and irregular plains of ice  which seemed to have no end.
Frankenstein,some of my comrades groaned  and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts  when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.
Frankenstein,we perceived a low carriage  fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs  pass on towards the north  at the distance of half a mile  a being which had the shape of a man  but apparently of gigantic stature  sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.
Frankenstein,we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.
Frankenstein,this appearance excited our unqualified wonder.
Frankenstein,we were  as we believed  many hundred miles from any land  but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not  in reality  so distant as we had supposed.
Frankenstein,shut in  however  by ice  it was impossible to follow his track  which we had observed with the greatest attention.
Frankenstein,about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea  and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.
Frankenstein,we  however  lay to until the morning  fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.
Frankenstein,i profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
Frankenstein,in the morning  however  as soon as it was light  i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel  apparently talking to someone in the sea.
Frankenstein,it was  in fact  a sledge  like that we had seen before  which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.
Frankenstein,only one dog remained alive  but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
Frankenstein,he was not  as the other traveller seemed to be  a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island  but a european.
Frankenstein,when i appeared on deck the master said     here is our captain  and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.
Frankenstein,on perceiving me  the stranger addressed me in english  although with a foreign accent.
Frankenstein,before i come on board your vessel    said he     will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound     you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.
Frankenstein,i replied  however  that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.
Frankenstein,upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
Frankenstein,good god  margaret  if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety  your surprise would have been boundless.
Frankenstein,his limbs were nearly frozen  and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.
Frankenstein,i never saw a man in so wretched a condition.
Frankenstein,we attempted to carry him into the cabin  but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.
Frankenstein,we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
Frankenstein,as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.
Frankenstein,by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup  which restored him wonderfully.
Frankenstein,two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak  and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.
Frankenstein,when he had in some measure recovered  i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.
Frankenstein,i never saw a more interesting creature  his eyes have generally an expression of wildness  and even madness  but there are moments when  if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service  his whole countenance is lighted up  as it were  with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled.
Frankenstein,but he is generally melancholy and despairing  and sometimes he gnashes his teeth  as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
Frankenstein,when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men  who wished to ask him a thousand questions  but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity  in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Frankenstein,once  however  the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.
Frankenstein,his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom  and he replied     to seek one who fled from me.
Frankenstein,and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion        yes.
Frankenstein,then i fancy we have seen him  for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge  with a man in it  across the ice.
Frankenstein,this aroused the stranger   s attention  and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the d  mon  as he called him  had pursued.
Frankenstein,soon after  when he was alone with me  he said     i have  doubtless  excited your curiosity  as well as that of these good people  but you are too considerate to make inquiries.
Frankenstein,certainly  it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.
Frankenstein,and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation  you have benevolently restored me to life.
Frankenstein,soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.
Frankenstein,i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty  for the ice had not broken until near midnight  and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time  but of this i could not judge.
Frankenstein,from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.
Frankenstein,he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared  but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin  for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
Frankenstein,i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.
Frankenstein,such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.
Frankenstein,the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Frankenstein,yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him  although they have had very little communication with him.
Frankenstein,for my own part  i begin to love him as a brother  and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.
Frankenstein,he must have been a noble creature in his better days  being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.
Frankenstein,i said in one of my letters  my dear margaret  that i should find no friend on the wide ocean  yet i have found a man who  before his spirit had been broken by misery  i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.
Frankenstein,i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals  should i have any fresh incidents to record.
Frankenstein,my affection for my guest increases every day.
Frankenstein,he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.
Frankenstein,how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief  he is so gentle  yet so wise  his mind is so cultivated  and when he speaks  although his words are culled with the choicest art  yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
Frankenstein,he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck  apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.
Frankenstein,yet  although unhappy  he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.
Frankenstein,he has frequently conversed with me on mine  which i have communicated to him without disguise.
Frankenstein,he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it.
Frankenstein,i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart  to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say  with all the fervour that warmed me  how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune  my existence  my every hope  to the furtherance of my enterprise.
Frankenstein,one man   s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought  for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.
Frankenstein,as i spoke  a dark gloom spread over my listener   s countenance.
Frankenstein,at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion  he placed his hands before his eyes  and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers  a groan burst from his heaving breast.
Frankenstein,i paused  at length he spoke  in broken accents     unhappy man  do you share my madness  have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught  hear me  let me reveal my tale  and you will dash the cup from your lips     such words  you may imagine  strongly excited my curiosity  but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers  and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.
Frankenstein,having conquered the violence of his feelings  he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion  and quelling the dark tyranny of despair  he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.
Frankenstein,he asked me the history of my earlier years.
Frankenstein,the tale was quickly told  but it awakened various trains of reflection.
Frankenstein,i spoke of my desire of finding a friend  of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot  and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
Frankenstein,i agree with you    replied the stranger     we are unfashioned creatures  but half made up  if one wiser  better  dearer than ourselves   such a friend ought to be   do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.
Frankenstein,i once had a friend  the most noble of human creatures  and am entitled  therefore  to judge respecting friendship.
Frankenstein,you have hope  and the world before you  and have no cause for despair.
Frankenstein,but i   i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.
Frankenstein,as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm  settled grief that touched me to the heart.
Frankenstein,but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.
Frankenstein,even broken in spirit as he is  no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.
Frankenstein,the starry sky  the sea  and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.
Frankenstein,such a man has a double existence  he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments  yet when he has retired into himself  he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him  within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
Frankenstein,will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer  you would not if you saw him.
Frankenstein,you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world  and you are therefore somewhat fastidious  but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.
Frankenstein,sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew.
Frankenstein,i believe it to be an intuitive discernment  a quick but never failing power of judgment  a penetration into the causes of things  unequalled for clearness and precision  add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul subduing music.
Frankenstein,yesterday the stranger said to me     you may easily perceive  captain walton  that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.
Frankenstein,i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me  but you have won me to alter my determination.
Frankenstein,you seek for knowledge and wisdom  as i once did  and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you  as mine has been.
Frankenstein,i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you  yet  when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course  exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am  i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale  one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.
Frankenstein,prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.
Frankenstein,were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief  perhaps your ridicule  but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever varied powers of nature  nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.
Frankenstein,you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication  yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.
Frankenstein,i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative  partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.
Frankenstein,i expressed these feelings in my answer.
Frankenstein,i thank you    he replied     for your sympathy  but it is useless  my fate is nearly fulfilled.
Frankenstein,i wait but for one event  and then i shall repose in peace.
Frankenstein,i understand your feeling    continued he  perceiving that i wished to interrupt him     but you are mistaken  my friend  if thus you will allow me to name you  nothing can alter my destiny  listen to my history  and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.
Frankenstein,he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure.
Frankenstein,this promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
Frankenstein,i have resolved every night  when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties  to record  as nearly as possible in his own words  what he has related during the day.
Frankenstein,if i should be engaged  i will at least make notes.
Frankenstein,this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure  but to me  who know him  and who hear it from his own lips   with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day  even now  as i commence my task  his full toned voice swells in my ears  his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness  i see his thin hand raised in animation  while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.
Frankenstein,strange and harrowing must be his story  frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it   thus
Frankenstein, i am by birth a genevese  and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.
Frankenstein,my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics  and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
Frankenstein,he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.
Frankenstein,he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country  a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early  nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.
Frankenstein,as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character  i cannot refrain from relating them.
Frankenstein,one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who  from a flourishing state  fell  through numerous mischances  into poverty.
Frankenstein,this man  whose name was beaufort  was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.
Frankenstein,having paid his debts  therefore  in the most honourable manner  he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne  where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.
Frankenstein,my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
Frankenstein,he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.
Frankenstein,he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out  with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.
Frankenstein,beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself  and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.
Frankenstein,overjoyed at this discovery  he hastened to the house  which was situated in a mean street near the reuss.
Frankenstein,but when he entered  misery and despair alone welcomed him.
Frankenstein,beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes  but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months  and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant   s house.
Frankenstein,the interval was  consequently  spent in inaction  his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection  and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness  incapable of any exertion.
Frankenstein,his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness  but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.
Frankenstein,but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould  and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.
Frankenstein,she procured plain work  she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
Frankenstein,several months passed in this manner.
Frankenstein,her father grew worse  her time was more entirely occupied in attending him  her means of subsistence decreased  and in the tenth month her father died in her arms  leaving her an orphan and a beggar.
Frankenstein,this last blow overcame her  and she knelt by beaufort   s coffin weeping bitterly  when my father entered the chamber.
Frankenstein,he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl  who committed herself to his care  and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.
Frankenstein,two years after this event caroline became his wife.
Frankenstein,there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents  but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
Frankenstein,there was a sense of justice in my father   s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.
Frankenstein,perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.
Frankenstein,there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother  differing wholly from the doting fondness of age  for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of  in some degree  recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured  but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.
Frankenstein,everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.
Frankenstein,he strove to shelter her  as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener  from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.
Frankenstein,her health  and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit  had been shaken by what she had gone through.
Frankenstein,during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions  and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy  and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders  as a restorative for her weakened frame.
Frankenstein,from italy they visited germany and france.
Frankenstein,i  their eldest child  was born at naples  and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.
Frankenstein,i remained for several years their only child.
Frankenstein,much as they were attached to each other  they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.
Frankenstein,my mother   s tender caresses and my father   s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
Frankenstein,i was their plaything and their idol  and something better   their child  the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven  whom to bring up to good  and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery  according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.
Frankenstein,with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life  added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both  it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience  of charity  and of self control  i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.
Frankenstein,for a long time i was their only care.
Frankenstein,my mother had much desired to have a daughter  but i continued their single offspring.
Frankenstein,when i was about five years old  while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy  they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como.
Frankenstein,their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.
Frankenstein,this  to my mother  was more than a duty  it was a necessity  a passion   remembering what she had suffered  and how she had been relieved   for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.
Frankenstein,during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate  while the number of half clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.
Frankenstein,one day  when my father had gone by himself to milan  my mother  accompanied by me  visited this abode.
Frankenstein,she found a peasant and his wife  hard working  bent down by care and labour  distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.
Frankenstein,among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.
Frankenstein,she appeared of a different stock.
Frankenstein,the four others were dark eyed  hardy little vagrants  this child was thin and very fair.
Frankenstein,her hair was the brightest living gold  and despite the poverty of her clothing  seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.
Frankenstein,her brow was clear and ample  her blue eyes cloudless  and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species  a being heaven sent  and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
Frankenstein,the peasant woman  perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl  eagerly communicated her history.
Frankenstein,she was not her child  but the daughter of a milanese nobleman.
Frankenstein,her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth.
Frankenstein,the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse  they were better off then.
Frankenstein,they had not been long married  and their eldest child was but just born.
Frankenstein,the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy   one among the schiavi ognor frementi  who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.
Frankenstein,he became the victim of its weakness.
Frankenstein,whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known.
Frankenstein,his property was confiscated  his child became an orphan and a beggar.
Frankenstein,she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode  fairer than a garden rose among dark leaved brambles.
Frankenstein,when my father returned from milan  he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub   a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.
Frankenstein,the apparition was soon explained.
Frankenstein,with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.
Frankenstein,they were fond of the sweet orphan.
Frankenstein,her presence had seemed a blessing to them  but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection.
Frankenstein,they consulted their village priest  and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents    house   my more than sister   the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.
Frankenstein,everyone loved elizabeth.
Frankenstein,the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became  while i shared it  my pride and my delight.
Frankenstein,on the evening previous to her being brought to my home  my mother had said playfully     i have a pretty present for my victor   tomorrow he shall have it.
Frankenstein,and when  on the morrow  she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift  i  with childish seriousness  interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine   mine to protect  love  and cherish.
Frankenstein,all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own.
Frankenstein,we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.
Frankenstein,no word  no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me   my more than sister  since till death she was to be mine only.
Frankenstein,we were brought up together  there was not quite a year difference in our ages.
Frankenstein,i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.
Frankenstein,harmony was the soul of our companionship  and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.
Frankenstein,elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition  but  with all my ardour  i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
Frankenstein,she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets  and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home    the sublime shapes of the mountains  the changes of the seasons  tempest and calm  the silence of winter  and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers   she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
Frankenstein,while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things  i delighted in investigating their causes.
Frankenstein,the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine.
Frankenstein,curiosity  earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature  gladness akin to rapture  as they were unfolded to me  are among the earliest sensations i can remember.
Frankenstein,on the birth of a second son  my junior by seven years  my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.
Frankenstein,we possessed a house in geneva  and a campagne on belrive  the eastern shore of the lake  at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.
Frankenstein,we resided principally in the latter  and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.
Frankenstein,it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.
Frankenstein,i was indifferent  therefore  to my school fellows in general  but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.
Frankenstein,henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva.
Frankenstein,he was a boy of singular talent and fancy.
Frankenstein,he loved enterprise  hardship  and even danger for its own sake.
Frankenstein,he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.
Frankenstein,he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.
Frankenstein,he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades  in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles  of the round table of king arthur  and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
Frankenstein,no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.
Frankenstein,my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
Frankenstein,we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice  but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.
Frankenstein,when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was  and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.
Frankenstein,my temper was sometimes violent  and my passions vehement  but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn  and not to learn all things indiscriminately.
Frankenstein,i confess that neither the structure of languages  nor the code of governments  nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.
Frankenstein,it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn  and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me  still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical  or in its highest sense  the physical secrets of the world.
Frankenstein,meanwhile clerval occupied himself  so to speak  with the moral relations of things.
Frankenstein,the busy stage of life  the virtues of heroes  and the actions of men were his theme  and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.
Frankenstein,the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
Frankenstein,her sympathy was ours  her smile  her soft voice  the sweet glance of her celestial eyes  were ever there to bless and animate us.
Frankenstein,she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract  i might have become sullen in my study  rough through the ardour of my nature  but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.
Frankenstein,and clerval   could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval  yet he might not have been so perfectly humane  so thoughtful in his generosity  so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit  had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.
Frankenstein,i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood  before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.
Frankenstein,besides  in drawing the picture of my early days  i also record those events which led  by insensible steps  to my after tale of misery  for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise  like a mountain river  from ignoble and almost forgotten sources  but  swelling as it proceeded  it became the torrent which  in its course  has swept away all my hopes and joys.
Frankenstein,natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate  i desire  therefore  in this narration  to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.
Frankenstein,when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon  the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.
Frankenstein,in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa.
Frankenstein,i opened it with apathy  the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.
Frankenstein,a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind  and bounding with joy  i communicated my discovery to my father.
Frankenstein,my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said     ah  cornelius agrippa  my dear victor  do not waste your time upon this  it is sad trash.
Frankenstein,if  instead of this remark  my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient  because the powers of the latter were chimerical  while those of the former were real and practical  under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination  warmed as it was  by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.
Frankenstein,it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
Frankenstein,but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents  and i continued to read with the greatest avidity.
Frankenstein,when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author  and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus.
Frankenstein,i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight  they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.
Frankenstein,i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.
Frankenstein,in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers  i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
Frankenstein,sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.
Frankenstein,those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boy   s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
Frankenstein,the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.
Frankenstein,the most learned philosopher knew little more.
Frankenstein,he had partially unveiled the face of nature  but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.
Frankenstein,he might dissect  anatomise  and give names  but  not to speak of a final cause  causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.
Frankenstein,i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature  and rashly and ignorantly i had repined.
Frankenstein,but here were books  and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.
Frankenstein,i took their word for all that they averred  and i became their disciple.
Frankenstein,it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century  but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva  i was  to a great degree  self taught with regard to my favourite studies.
Frankenstein,my father was not scientific  and i was left to struggle with a child   s blindness  added to a student   s thirst for knowledge.
Frankenstein,under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher   s stone and the elixir of life  but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.
Frankenstein,wealth was an inferior object  but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death   nor were these my only visions.
Frankenstein,the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors  the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought  and if my incantations were always unsuccessful  i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.
Frankenstein,and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems  mingling  like an unadept  a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge  guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning  till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.
Frankenstein,when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive  when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.
Frankenstein,it advanced from behind the mountains of jura  and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.
Frankenstein,i remained  while the storm lasted  watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
Frankenstein,as i stood at the door  on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house  and so soon as the dazzling light vanished  the oak had disappeared  and nothing remained but a blasted stump.
Frankenstein,when we visited it the next morning  we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.
Frankenstein,it was not splintered by the shock  but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.
Frankenstein,i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
Frankenstein,before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.
Frankenstein,on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us  and excited by this catastrophe  he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism  which was at once new and astonishing to me.
Frankenstein,all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa  albertus magnus  and paracelsus  the lords of my imagination  but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.
Frankenstein,it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.
Frankenstein,all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
Frankenstein,by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth  i at once gave up my former occupations  set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation  and entertained the greatest disdain for a would be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.
Frankenstein,in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations  and so worthy of my consideration.
Frankenstein,thus strangely are our souls constructed  and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.
Frankenstein,when i look back  it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life   the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.
Frankenstein,her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.
Frankenstein,it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution  happiness with their disregard.
Frankenstein,it was a strong effort of the spirit of good  but it was ineffectual.
Frankenstein,destiny was too potent  and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.
Frankenstein,when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva  but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.
Frankenstein,my departure was therefore fixed at an early date  but before the day resolved upon could arrive  the first misfortune of my life occurred   an omen  as it were  of my future misery.
Frankenstein,elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever  her illness was severe  and she was in the greatest danger.
Frankenstein,during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.
Frankenstein,she had at first yielded to our entreaties  but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced  she could no longer control her anxiety.
Frankenstein,she attended her sickbed  her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper   elizabeth was saved  but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.
Frankenstein,on the third day my mother sickened  her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms  and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.
Frankenstein,on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.
Frankenstein,she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself.
Frankenstein,my children    she said     my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.
Frankenstein,this expectation will now be the consolation of your father.
Frankenstein,elizabeth  my love  you must supply my place to my younger children.
Frankenstein,alas  i regret that i am taken from you  and  happy and beloved as i have been  is it not hard to quit you all  but these are not thoughts befitting me  i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.
Frankenstein,she died calmly  and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
Frankenstein,i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil  the void that presents itself to the soul  and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.
Frankenstein,it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever   that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed  never more to be heard.
Frankenstein,these are the reflections of the first days  but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil  then the actual bitterness of grief commences.
Frankenstein,yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection  and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt  and must feel  the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity  and the smile that plays upon the lips  although it may be deemed a sacrilege  is not banished.
Frankenstein,my mother was dead  but we had still duties which we ought to perform  we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.
Frankenstein,my departure for ingolstadt  which had been deferred by these events  was now again determined upon.
Frankenstein,i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.
Frankenstein,it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose  akin to death  of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.
Frankenstein,i was new to sorrow  but it did not the less alarm me.
Frankenstein,i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me  and above all  i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled.
Frankenstein,she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
Frankenstein,she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
Frankenstein,she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.
Frankenstein,never was she so enchanting as at this time  when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
Frankenstein,she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
Frankenstein,the day of my departure at length arrived.
Frankenstein,clerval spent the last evening with us.
Frankenstein,he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student  but in vain.
Frankenstein,his father was a narrow minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
Frankenstein,henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.
Frankenstein,he said little  but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
Frankenstein,we sat late.
Frankenstein,we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word    farewell    it was said  and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose  each fancying that the other was deceived  but when at morning   s dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away  they were all there   my father again to bless me  clerval to press my hand once more  my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
Frankenstein,i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.
Frankenstein,i  who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions  continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure   i was now alone.
Frankenstein,in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector.
Frankenstein,my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic  and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.
Frankenstein,i loved my brothers  elizabeth  and clerval  these were    old familiar faces    but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.
Frankenstein,such were my reflections as i commenced my journey  but as i proceeded  my spirits and hopes rose.
Frankenstein,i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.
Frankenstein,i had often  when at home  thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
Frankenstein,now my desires were complied with  and it would  indeed  have been folly to repent.
Frankenstein,i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt  which was long and fatiguing.
Frankenstein,at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.
Frankenstein,i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased.
Frankenstein,the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.
Frankenstein,chance   or rather the evil influence  the angel of destruction  which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father   s door   led me first to m. krempe  professor of natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,he was an uncouth man  but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.
Frankenstein,he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,i replied carelessly  and partly in contempt  mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied.
Frankenstein,the professor stared.
Frankenstein,have you    he said     really spent your time in studying such nonsense     i replied in the affirmative.
Frankenstein,every minute    continued m. krempe with warmth     every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.
Frankenstein,you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.
Frankenstein,good god  in what desert land have you lived  where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient  i little expected  in this enlightened and scientific age  to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus.
Frankenstein,my dear sir  you must begin your studies entirely anew.
Frankenstein,so saying  he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure  and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations  and that m. waldman  a fellow professor  would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.
Frankenstein,i returned home not disappointed  for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated  but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.
Frankenstein,m. krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance  the teacher  therefore  did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.
Frankenstein,in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain  perhaps  i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years.
Frankenstein,as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
Frankenstein,with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters  i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
Frankenstein,besides  i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power  such views  although futile  were grand  but now the scene was changed.
Frankenstein,the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.
Frankenstein,i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
Frankenstein,such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt  which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.
Frankenstein,but as the ensuing week commenced  i thought of the information which m. krempe had given me concerning the lectures.
Frankenstein,and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit  i recollected what he had said of m. waldman  whom i had never seen  as he had hitherto been out of town.
Frankenstein,partly from curiosity and partly from idleness  i went into the lecturing room  which m. waldman entered shortly after.
Frankenstein,this professor was very unlike his colleague.
Frankenstein,he appeared about fifty years of age  but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence  a few grey hairs covered his temples  but those at the back of his head were nearly black.
Frankenstein,his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard.
Frankenstein,he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning  pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
Frankenstein,he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.
Frankenstein,after having made a few preparatory experiments  he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry  the terms of which i shall never forget      the ancient teachers of this science    said he     promised impossibilities and performed nothing.
Frankenstein,the modern masters promise very little  they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers  whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt  and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible  have indeed performed miracles.
Frankenstein,they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding places.
Frankenstein,they ascend into the heavens  they have discovered how the blood circulates  and the nature of the air we breathe.
Frankenstein,they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers  they can command the thunders of heaven  mimic the earthquake  and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Frankenstein,such were the professor   s words   rather let me say such the words of the fate   enounced to destroy me.
Frankenstein,as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy  one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being  chord after chord was sounded  and soon my mind was filled with one thought  one conception  one purpose.
Frankenstein,so much has been done  exclaimed the soul of frankenstein   more  far more  will i achieve  treading in the steps already marked  i will pioneer a new way  explore unknown powers  and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
Frankenstein,i closed not my eyes that night.
Frankenstein,my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil  i felt that order would thence arise  but i had no power to produce it.
Frankenstein,by degrees  after the morning   s dawn  sleep came.
Frankenstein,i awoke  and my yesternight   s thoughts were as a dream.
Frankenstein,there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent.
Frankenstein,on the same day i paid m. waldman a visit.
Frankenstein,his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public  for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
Frankenstein,i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor.
Frankenstein,he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus  but without the contempt that m. krempe had exhibited.
Frankenstein,he said that    these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.
Frankenstein,they had left to us  as an easier task  to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
Frankenstein,the labours of men of genius  however erroneously directed  scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.
Frankenstein,i listened to his statement  which was delivered without any presumption or affectation  and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists  i expressed myself in measured terms  with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor  without letting escape  inexperience in life would have made me ashamed  any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.
Frankenstein,i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure.
Frankenstein,i am happy    said m. waldman     to have gained a disciple  and if your application equals your ability  i have no doubt of your success.
Frankenstein,chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made  it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study  but at the same time  i have not neglected the other branches of science.
Frankenstein,a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.
Frankenstein,if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist  i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy  including mathematics.
Frankenstein,he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines  instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.
Frankenstein,he also gave me the list of books which i had requested  and i took my leave.
Frankenstein,thus ended a day memorable to me  it decided my future destiny.
Frankenstein,from this day natural philosophy  and particularly chemistry  in the most comprehensive sense of the term  became nearly my sole occupation.
Frankenstein,i read with ardour those works  so full of genius and discrimination  which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.
Frankenstein,i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university  and i found even in m. krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information  combined  it is true  with a repulsive physiognomy and manners  but not on that account the less valuable.
Frankenstein,in m. waldman i found a true friend.
Frankenstein,his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism  and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.
Frankenstein,in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
Frankenstein,my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain  it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory.
Frankenstein,as i applied so closely  it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.
Frankenstein,my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students  and my proficiency that of the masters.
Frankenstein,professor krempe often asked me  with a sly smile  how cornelius agrippa went on  whilst m. waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
Frankenstein,two years passed in this manner  during which i paid no visit to geneva  but was engaged  heart and soul  in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make.
Frankenstein,none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
Frankenstein,in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you  and there is nothing more to know  but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
Frankenstein,a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study  and i  who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this  improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments  which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.
Frankenstein,when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt  my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements  i thought of returning to my friends and my native town  when an incident happened that protracted my stay.
Frankenstein,one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame  and  indeed  any animal endued with life.
Frankenstein,whence  i often asked myself  did the principle of life proceed  it was a bold question  and one which has ever been considered as a mystery  yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted  if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.
Frankenstein,i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.
Frankenstein,unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm  my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.
Frankenstein,to examine the causes of life  we must first have recourse to death.
Frankenstein,i became acquainted with the science of anatomy  but this was not sufficient  i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
Frankenstein,in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.
Frankenstein,i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.
Frankenstein,darkness had no effect upon my fancy  and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life  which  from being the seat of beauty and strength  had become food for the worm.
Frankenstein,now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses.
Frankenstein,my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.
Frankenstein,i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted  i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life  i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.
Frankenstein,i paused  examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation  as exemplified in the change from life to death  and death to life  until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me   a light so brilliant and wondrous  yet so simple  that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated  i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science  that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.
Frankenstein,remember  i am not recording the vision of a madman.
Frankenstein,the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true.
Frankenstein,some miracle might have produced it  yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.
Frankenstein,after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue  i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life  nay  more  i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
Frankenstein,the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.
Frankenstein,after so much time spent in painful labour  to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.
Frankenstein,but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated  and i beheld only the result.
Frankenstein,what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.
Frankenstein,not that  like a magic scene  it all opened upon me at once  the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.
Frankenstein,i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life  aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.
Frankenstein,i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express  my friend  that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted  that cannot be  listen patiently until the end of my story  and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject.
Frankenstein,i will not lead you on  unguarded and ardent as i then was  to your destruction and infallible misery.
Frankenstein,learn from me  if not by my precepts  at least by my example  how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world  than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
Frankenstein,when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands  i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it.
Frankenstein,although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation  yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it  with all its intricacies of fibres  muscles  and veins  still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.
Frankenstein,i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself  or one of simpler organization  but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.
Frankenstein,the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking  but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed.
Frankenstein,i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses  my operations might be incessantly baffled  and at last my work be imperfect  yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics  i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.
Frankenstein,nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
Frankenstein,it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being.
Frankenstein,as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed  i resolved  contrary to my first intention  to make the being of a gigantic stature  that is to say  about eight feet in height  and proportionably large.
Frankenstein,after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials  i began.
Frankenstein,no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards  like a hurricane  in the first enthusiasm of success.
Frankenstein,life and death appeared to me ideal bounds  which i should first break through  and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.
Frankenstein,a new species would bless me as its creator and source  many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
Frankenstein,no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs.
Frankenstein,pursuing these reflections  i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter  i might in process of time  although i now found it impossible  renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
Frankenstein,these thoughts supported my spirits  while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.
Frankenstein,my cheek had grown pale with study  and my person had become emaciated with confinement.
Frankenstein,sometimes  on the very brink of certainty  i failed  yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.
Frankenstein,one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself  and the moon gazed on my midnight labours  while  with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness  i pursued nature to her hiding places.
Frankenstein,who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay  my limbs now tremble  and my eyes swim with the remembrance  but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward  i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.
Frankenstein,it was indeed but a passing trance  that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as  the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate  i had returned to my old habits.
Frankenstein,i collected bones from charnel houses and disturbed  with profane fingers  the tremendous secrets of the human frame.
Frankenstein,in a solitary chamber  or rather cell  at the top of the house  and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase  i kept my workshop of filthy creation  my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.
Frankenstein,the dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials  and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation  whilst  still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased  i brought my work near to a conclusion.
Frankenstein,the summer months passed while i was thus engaged  heart and soul  in one pursuit.
Frankenstein,it was a most beautiful season  never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage  but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.
Frankenstein,and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent  and whom i had not seen for so long a time.
Frankenstein,i knew my silence disquieted them  and i well remembered the words of my father     i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection  and we shall hear regularly from you.
Frankenstein,you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.
Frankenstein,i knew well therefore what would be my father   s feelings  but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment  loathsome in itself  but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.
Frankenstein,i wished  as it were  to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object  which swallowed up every habit of my nature  should be completed.
Frankenstein,i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part  but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame.
Frankenstein,a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
Frankenstein,i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
Frankenstein,if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix  then that study is certainly unlawful  that is to say  not befitting the human mind.
Frankenstein,if this rule were always observed  if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections  greece had not been enslaved  c  sar would have spared his country  america would have been discovered more gradually  and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed.
Frankenstein,but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale  and your looks remind me to proceed.
Frankenstein,my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
Frankenstein,winter  spring  and summer passed away during my labours  but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves   sights which before always yielded me supreme delight   so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation.
Frankenstein,the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close  and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded.
Frankenstein,but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety  and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines  or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
Frankenstein,every night i was oppressed by a slow fever  and i became nervous to a most painful degree  the fall of a leaf startled me  and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime.
Frankenstein,sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become  the energy of my purpose alone sustained me  my labours would soon end  and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease  and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.
Frankenstein,it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
Frankenstein,with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony  i collected the instruments of life around me  that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.
Frankenstein,it was already one in the morning  the rain pattered dismally against the panes  and my candle was nearly burnt out  when  by the glimmer of the half extinguished light  i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open  it breathed hard  and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
Frankenstein,how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe  or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form  his limbs were in proportion  and i had selected his features as beautiful.
Frankenstein,beautiful  great god  his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath  his hair was of a lustrous black  and flowing  his teeth of a pearly whiteness  but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes  that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set  his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
Frankenstein,the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
Frankenstein,i had worked hard for nearly two years  for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.
Frankenstein,for this i had deprived myself of rest and health.
Frankenstein,i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation  but now that i had finished  the beauty of the dream vanished  and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
Frankenstein,unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created  i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber  unable to compose my mind to sleep.
Frankenstein,at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured  and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes  endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
Frankenstein,but it was in vain  i slept  indeed  but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams.
Frankenstein,i thought i saw elizabeth  in the bloom of health  walking in the streets of ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,delighted and surprised  i embraced her  but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips  they became livid with the hue of death  her features appeared to change  and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms  a shroud enveloped her form  and i saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
Frankenstein,i started from my sleep with horror  a cold dew covered my forehead  my teeth chattered  and every limb became convulsed  when  by the dim and yellow light of the moon  as it forced its way through the window shutters  i beheld the wretch   the miserable monster whom i had created.
Frankenstein,he held up the curtain of the bed  and his eyes  if eyes they may be called  were fixed on me.
Frankenstein,his jaws opened  and he muttered some inarticulate sounds  while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.
Frankenstein,he might have spoken  but i did not hear  one hand was stretched out  seemingly to detain me  but i escaped and rushed downstairs.
Frankenstein,i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited  where i remained during the rest of the night  walking up and down in the greatest agitation  listening attentively  catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life.
Frankenstein,oh  no mortal could support the horror of that countenance.
Frankenstein,a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.
Frankenstein,i had gazed on him while unfinished  he was ugly then  but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion  it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived.
Frankenstein,i passed the night wretchedly.
Frankenstein,sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery  at others  i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.
Frankenstein,mingled with this horror  i felt the bitterness of disappointment  dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me  and the change was so rapid  the overthrow so complete   morning  dismal and wet  at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt  its white steeple and clock  which indicated the sixth hour.
Frankenstein,the porter opened the gates of the court  which had that night been my asylum  and i issued into the streets  pacing them with quick steps  as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view.
Frankenstein,i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited  but felt impelled to hurry on  although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
Frankenstein,i continued walking in this manner for some time  endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.
Frankenstein,i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing.
Frankenstein,my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear  and i hurried on with irregular steps  not daring to look about me   like one who  on a lonely road  doth walk in fear and dread  and  having once turned round  walks on  and turns no more his head  because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread.
Frankenstein,coleridge   s    ancient mariner.
Frankenstein,continuing thus  i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.
Frankenstein,here i paused  i knew not why  but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.
Frankenstein,as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence  it stopped just where i was standing  and on the door being opened  i perceived henry clerval  who  on seeing me  instantly sprung out.
Frankenstein,my dear frankenstein    exclaimed he     how glad i am to see you  how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting     nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval  his presence brought back to my thoughts my father  elizabeth  and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
Frankenstein,i grasped his hand  and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune  i felt suddenly  and for the first time during many months  calm and serene joy.
Frankenstein,i welcomed my friend  therefore  in the most cordial manner  and we walked towards my college.
Frankenstein,clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,you may easily believe    said he     how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book keeping  and  indeed  i believe i left him incredulous to the last  for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield     i have ten thousand florins a year without greek  i eat heartily without greek.
Frankenstein,but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning  and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.
Frankenstein,it gives me the greatest delight to see you  but tell me how you left my father  brothers  and elizabeth.
Frankenstein,very well  and very happy  only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.
Frankenstein,by the by  i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.
Frankenstein,but  my dear frankenstein    continued he  stopping short and gazing full in my face     i did not before remark how very ill you appear  so thin and pale  you look as if you had been watching for several nights.
Frankenstein,you have guessed right  i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest  as you see  but i hope  i sincerely hope  that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free.
Frankenstein,i trembled excessively  i could not endure to think of  and far less to allude to  the occurrences of the preceding night.
Frankenstein,i walked with a quick pace  and we soon arrived at my college.
Frankenstein,i then reflected  and the thought made me shiver  that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there  alive and walking about.
Frankenstein,i dreaded to behold this monster  but i feared still more that henry should see him.
Frankenstein,entreating him  therefore  to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs  i darted up towards my own room.
Frankenstein,my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself.
Frankenstein,i then paused  and a cold shivering came over me.
Frankenstein,i threw the door forcibly open  as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side  but nothing appeared.
Frankenstein,i stepped fearfully in  the apartment was empty  and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.
Frankenstein,i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me  but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled  i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval.
Frankenstein,we ascended into my room  and the servant presently brought breakfast  but i was unable to contain myself.
Frankenstein,it was not joy only that possessed me  i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness  and my pulse beat rapidly.
Frankenstein,i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place  i jumped over the chairs  clapped my hands  and laughed aloud.
Frankenstein,clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival  but when he observed me more attentively  he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account  and my loud  unrestrained  heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.
Frankenstein,my dear victor    cried he     what  for god   s sake  is the matter  do not laugh in that manner.
Frankenstein,how ill you are  what is the cause of all this        do not ask me    cried i  putting my hands before my eyes  for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room     he can tell.
Frankenstein,oh  save me  save me    i imagined that the monster seized me  i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
Frankenstein,poor clerval  what must have been his feelings  a meeting  which he anticipated with such joy  so strangely turned to bitterness.
Frankenstein,but i was not the witness of his grief  for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long  long time.
Frankenstein,this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.
Frankenstein,during all that time henry was my only nurse.
Frankenstein,i afterwards learned that  knowing my father   s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey  and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth  he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.
Frankenstein,he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself  and  firm in the hope he felt of my recovery  he did not doubt that  instead of doing harm  he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.
Frankenstein,but i was in reality very ill  and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
Frankenstein,the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes  and i raved incessantly concerning him.
Frankenstein,doubtless my words surprised henry  he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination  but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
Frankenstein,by very slow degrees  and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend  i recovered.
Frankenstein,i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure  i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.
Frankenstein,it was a divine spring  and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.
Frankenstein,i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom  my gloom disappeared  and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion.
Frankenstein,dearest clerval    exclaimed i     how kind  how very good you are to me.
Frankenstein,this whole winter  instead of being spent in study  as you promised yourself  has been consumed in my sick room.
Frankenstein,how shall i ever repay you  i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion  but you will forgive me.
Frankenstein,you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself  but get well as fast as you can  and since you appear in such good spirits  i may speak to you on one subject  may i not     i trembled.
Frankenstein,one subject  what could it be  could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think      compose yourself    said clerval  who observed my change of colour     i will not mention it if it agitates you  but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
Frankenstein,they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.
Frankenstein,is that all  my dear henry  how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear  dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love        if this is your present temper  my friend  you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you  it is from your cousin  i believe.
Frankenstein,clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
Frankenstein,it was from my own elizabeth      my dearest cousin      you have been ill  very ill  and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.
Frankenstein,you are forbidden to write   to hold a pen  yet one word from you  dear victor  is necessary to calm our apprehensions.
Frankenstein,for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line  and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey  yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself  i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse  who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.
Frankenstein,yet that is over now  clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.
Frankenstein,i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
Frankenstein,get well   and return to us.
Frankenstein,you will find a happy  cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.
Frankenstein,your father   s health is vigorous  and he asks but to see you  but to be assured that you are well  and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
Frankenstein,how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest  he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.
Frankenstein,he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service  but we cannot part with him  at least until his elder brother returns to us.
Frankenstein,my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country  but ernest never had your powers of application.
Frankenstein,he looks upon study as an odious fetter  his time is spent in the open air  climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.
Frankenstein,i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
Frankenstein,little alteration  except the growth of our dear children  has taken place since you left us.
Frankenstein,the blue lake and snow clad mountains   they never change  and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.
Frankenstein,my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me  and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy  kind faces around me.
Frankenstein,since you left us  but one change has taken place in our little household.
Frankenstein,do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family  probably you do not  i will relate her history  therefore in a few words.
Frankenstein,madame moritz  her mother  was a widow with four children  of whom justine was the third.
Frankenstein,this girl had always been the favourite of her father  but through a strange perversity  her mother could not endure her  and after the death of m. moritz  treated her very ill. my aunt observed this  and when justine was twelve years of age  prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
Frankenstein,the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.
Frankenstein,hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants  and the lower orders  being neither so poor nor so despised  their manners are more refined and moral.
Frankenstein,a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england.
Frankenstein,justine  thus received in our family  learned the duties of a servant  a condition which  in our fortunate country  does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
Frankenstein,justine  you may remember  was a great favourite of yours  and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour  one glance from justine could dissipate it  for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica   she looked so frank hearted and happy.
Frankenstein,my aunt conceived a great attachment for her  by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.
Frankenstein,this benefit was fully repaid  justine was the most grateful little creature in the world  i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips  but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Frankenstein,although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate  yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.
Frankenstein,she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners  so that even now she often reminds me of her.
Frankenstein,when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine  who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.
Frankenstein,poor justine was very ill  but other trials were reserved for her.
Frankenstein,one by one  her brothers and sister died  and her mother  with the exception of her neglected daughter  was left childless.
Frankenstein,the conscience of the woman was troubled  she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.
Frankenstein,she was a roman catholic  and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.
Frankenstein,accordingly  a few months after your departure for ingolstadt  justine was called home by her repentant mother.
Frankenstein,poor girl  she wept when she quitted our house  she was much altered since the death of my aunt  grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners  which had before been remarkable for vivacity.
Frankenstein,nor was her residence at her mother   s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.
Frankenstein,the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
Frankenstein,she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness  but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
Frankenstein,perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline  which at first increased her irritability  but she is now at peace for ever.
Frankenstein,she died on the first approach of cold weather  at the beginning of this last winter.
Frankenstein,justine has just returned to us  and i assure you i love her tenderly.
Frankenstein,she is very clever and gentle  and extremely pretty  as i mentioned before  her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
Frankenstein,i must say also a few words to you  my dear cousin  of little darling william.
Frankenstein,i wish you could see him  he is very tall of his age  with sweet laughing blue eyes  dark eyelashes  and curling hair.
Frankenstein,when he smiles  two little dimples appear on each cheek  which are rosy with health.
Frankenstein,he has already had one or two little wives  but louisa biron is his favourite  a pretty little girl of five years of age.
Frankenstein,now  dear victor  i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva.
Frankenstein,the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman  john melbourne  esq.
Frankenstein,her ugly sister  manon  married m. duvillard  the rich banker  last autumn.
Frankenstein,your favourite schoolfellow  louis manoir  has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva.
Frankenstein,but he has already recovered his spirits  and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman  madame tavernier.
Frankenstein,she is a widow  and much older than manoir  but she is very much admired  and a favourite with everybody.
Frankenstein,i have written myself into better spirits  dear cousin  but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude.
Frankenstein,write  dearest victor    one line   one word will be a blessing to us.
Frankenstein,ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness  his affection  and his many letters  we are sincerely grateful.
Frankenstein,adieu  my cousin  take care of yourself  and  i entreat you  write      elizabeth lavenza.
Frankenstein,geneva  march   th       .
Frankenstein,dear  dear elizabeth    i exclaimed  when i had read her letter     i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.
Frankenstein,i wrote  and this exertion greatly fatigued me  but my convalescence had commenced  and proceeded regularly.
Frankenstein,in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber.
Frankenstein,one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university.
Frankenstein,in doing this  i underwent a kind of rough usage  ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.
Frankenstein,ever since the fatal night  the end of my labours  and the beginning of my misfortunes  i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,when i was otherwise quite restored to health  the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
Frankenstein,henry saw this  and had removed all my apparatus from my view.
Frankenstein,he had also changed my apartment  for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.
Frankenstein,but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors.
Frankenstein,m. waldman inflicted torture when he praised  with kindness and warmth  the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences.
Frankenstein,he soon perceived that i disliked the subject  but not guessing the real cause  he attributed my feelings to modesty  and changed the subject from my improvement  to the science itself  with a desire  as i evidently saw  of drawing me out.
Frankenstein,what could i do  he meant to please  and he tormented me.
Frankenstein,i felt as if he had placed carefully  one by one  in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.
Frankenstein,i writhed under his words  yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt.
Frankenstein,clerval  whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others  declined the subject  alleging  in excuse  his total ignorance  and the conversation took a more general turn.
Frankenstein,i thanked my friend from my heart  but i did not speak.
Frankenstein,i saw plainly that he was surprised  but he never attempted to draw my secret from me  and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds  yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection  but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
Frankenstein,m. krempe was not equally docile  and in my condition at that time  of almost insupportable sensitiveness  his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman.
Frankenstein,d   n the fellow    cried he     why  m. clerval  i assure you he has outstript us all.
Frankenstein,ay  stare if you please  but it is nevertheless true.
Frankenstein,a youngster who  but a few years ago  believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel  has now set himself at the head of the university  and if he is not soon pulled down  we shall all be out of countenance.
Frankenstein,ay  ay    continued he  observing my face expressive of suffering     m. frankenstein is modest  an excellent quality in a young man.
Frankenstein,young men should be diffident of themselves  you know  m. clerval  i was myself when young  but that wears out in a very short time.
Frankenstein,m. krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself  which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
Frankenstein,clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science  and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.
Frankenstein,he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages  and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.
Frankenstein,resolved to pursue no inglorious career  he turned his eyes toward the east  as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.
Frankenstein,the persian  arabic  and sanskrit languages engaged his attention  and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies.
Frankenstein,idleness had ever been irksome to me  and now that i wished to fly from reflection  and hated my former studies  i felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend  and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.
Frankenstein,i did not  like him  attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects  for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.
Frankenstein,i read merely to understand their meaning  and they well repaid my labours.
Frankenstein,their melancholy is soothing  and their joy elevating  to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.
Frankenstein,when you read their writings  life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses    in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy  and the fire that consumes your own heart.
Frankenstein,how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome   summer passed away in these occupations  and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn  but being delayed by several accidents  winter and snow arrived  the roads were deemed impassable  and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.
Frankenstein,i felt this delay very bitterly  for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.
Frankenstein,my return had only been delayed so long  from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place  before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.
Frankenstein,the winter  however  was spent cheerfully  and although the spring was uncommonly late  when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
Frankenstein,the month of may had already commenced  and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure  when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt  that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited.
Frankenstein,i acceded with pleasure to this proposition  i was fond of exercise  and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country.
Frankenstein,we passed a fortnight in these perambulations  my health and spirits had long been restored  and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed  the natural incidents of our progress  and the conversation of my friend.
Frankenstein,study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures  and rendered me unsocial  but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart  he again taught me to love the aspect of nature  and the cheerful faces of children.
Frankenstein,excellent friend  how sincerely you did love me  and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.
Frankenstein,a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me  until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses  i became the same happy creature who  a few years ago  loved and beloved by all  had no sorrow or care.
Frankenstein,when happy  inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.
Frankenstein,a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
Frankenstein,the present season was indeed divine  the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges  while those of summer were already in bud.
Frankenstein,i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me  notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off  with an invincible burden.
Frankenstein,henry rejoiced in my gaiety  and sincerely sympathised in my feelings  he exerted himself to amuse me  while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.
Frankenstein,the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing  his conversation was full of imagination  and very often  in imitation of the persian and arabic writers  he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.
Frankenstein,at other times he repeated my favourite poems  or drew me out into arguments  which he supported with great ingenuity.
Frankenstein,we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon  the peasants were dancing  and every one we met appeared gay and happy.
Frankenstein,my own spirits were high  and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
Frankenstein, on my return  i found the following letter from my father         my dear victor      you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us  and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines  merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you.
Frankenstein,but that would be a cruel kindness  and i dare not do it.
Frankenstein,what would be your surprise  my son  when you expected a happy and glad welcome  to behold  on the contrary  tears and wretchedness  and how  victor  can i relate our misfortune  absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs  and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son  i wish to prepare you for the woeful news  but i know it is impossible  even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
Frankenstein,william is dead    that sweet child  whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart  who was so gentle  yet so gay  victor  he is murdered      i will not attempt to console you  but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.
Frankenstein,last thursday  may  th   i  my niece  and your two brothers  went to walk in plainpalais.
Frankenstein,the evening was warm and serene  and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.
Frankenstein,it was already dusk before we thought of returning  and then we discovered that william and ernest  who had gone on before  were not to be found.
Frankenstein,we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
Frankenstein,presently ernest came  and enquired if we had seen his brother  he said  that he had been playing with him  that william had run away to hide himself  and that he vainly sought for him  and afterwards waited for a long time  but that he did not return.
Frankenstein,this account rather alarmed us  and we continued to search for him until night fell  when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.
Frankenstein,he was not there.
Frankenstein,we returned again  with torches  for i could not rest  when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself  and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night  elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.
Frankenstein,about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy  whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health  stretched on the grass livid and motionless  the print of the murder   s finger was on his neck.
Frankenstein,he was conveyed home  and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth.
Frankenstein,she was very earnest to see the corpse.
Frankenstein,at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted  and entering the room where it lay  hastily examined the neck of the victim  and clasping her hands exclaimed     o god  i have murdered my darling child         she fainted  and was restored with extreme difficulty.
Frankenstein,when she again lived  it was only to weep and sigh.
Frankenstein,she told me  that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.
Frankenstein,this picture is gone  and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.
Frankenstein,we have no trace of him at present  although our exertions to discover him are unremitted  but they will not restore my beloved william      come  dearest victor  you alone can console elizabeth.
Frankenstein,she weeps continually  and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death  her words pierce my heart.
Frankenstein,we are all unhappy  but will not that be an additional motive for you  my son  to return and be our comforter  your dear mother  alas  victor  i now say  thank god she did not live to witness the cruel  miserable death of her youngest darling      come  victor  not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin  but with feelings of peace and gentleness  that will heal  instead of festering  the wounds of our minds.
Frankenstein,enter the house of mourning  my friend  but with kindness and affection for those who love you  and not with hatred for your enemies.
Frankenstein,your affectionate and afflicted father     alphonse frankenstein.
Frankenstein,geneva  may   th       .
Frankenstein,clerval  who had watched my countenance as i read this letter  was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving news from my friends.
Frankenstein,i threw the letter on the table  and covered my face with my hands.
Frankenstein,my dear frankenstein    exclaimed henry  when he perceived me weep with bitterness     are you always to be unhappy  my dear friend  what has happened     i motioned him to take up the letter  while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.
Frankenstein,tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval  as he read the account of my misfortune.
Frankenstein,i can offer you no consolation  my friend    said he     your disaster is irreparable.
Frankenstein,what do you intend to do        to go instantly to geneva  come with me  henry  to order the horses.
Frankenstein,during our walk  clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation  he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.
Frankenstein,poor william    said he     dear lovely child  he now sleeps with his angel mother  who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty  but must weep over his untimely loss  to die so miserably  to feel the murderer   s grasp  how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence  poor little fellow  one only consolation have we  his friends mourn and weep  but he is at rest.
Frankenstein,the pang is over  his sufferings are at an end for ever.
Frankenstein,a sod covers his gentle form  and he knows no pain.
Frankenstein,he can no longer be a subject for pity  we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.
Frankenstein,clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets  the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude.
Frankenstein,but now  as soon as the horses arrived  i hurried into a cabriolet  and bade farewell to my friend.
Frankenstein,my journey was very melancholy.
Frankenstein,at first i wished to hurry on  for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends  but when i drew near my native town  i slackened my progress.
Frankenstein,i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.
Frankenstein,i passed through scenes familiar to my youth  but which i had not seen for nearly six years.
Frankenstein,how altered every thing might be during that time  one sudden and desolating change had taken place  but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations  which  although they were done more tranquilly  might not be the less decisive.
Frankenstein,fear overcame me  i dared no advance  dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble  although i was unable to define them.
Frankenstein,i remained two days at lausanne  in this painful state of mind.
Frankenstein,i contemplated the lake  the waters were placid  all around was calm  and the snowy mountains     the palaces of nature    were not changed.
Frankenstein,by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me  and i continued my journey towards geneva.
Frankenstein,the road ran by the side of the lake  which became narrower as i approached my native town.
Frankenstein,i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura  and the bright summit of mont blanc.
Frankenstein,i wept like a child.
Frankenstein,dear mountains  my own beautiful lake  how do you welcome your wanderer  your summits are clear  the sky and lake are blue and placid.
Frankenstein,is this to prognosticate peace  or to mock at my unhappiness     i fear  my friend  that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances  but they were days of comparative happiness  and i think of them with pleasure.
Frankenstein,my country  my beloved country  who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams  thy mountains  and  more than all  thy lovely lake   yet  as i drew nearer home  grief and fear again overcame me.
Frankenstein,night also closed around  and when i could hardly see the dark mountains  i felt still more gloomily.
Frankenstein,the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil  and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.
Frankenstein,alas  i prophesied truly  and failed only in one single circumstance  that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded  i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure.
Frankenstein,it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva  the gates of the town were already shut  and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron  a village at the distance of half a league from the city.
Frankenstein,the sky was serene  and  as i was unable to rest  i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered.
Frankenstein,as i could not pass through the town  i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais.
Frankenstein,during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures.
Frankenstein,the storm appeared to approach rapidly  and  on landing  i ascended a low hill  that i might observe its progress.
Frankenstein,it advanced  the heavens were clouded  and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops  but its violence quickly increased.
Frankenstein,i quitted my seat  and walked on  although the darkness and storm increased every minute  and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.
Frankenstein,it was echoed from sal  ve  the juras  and the alps of savoy  vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes  illuminating the lake  making it appear like a vast sheet of fire  then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness  until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.
Frankenstein,the storm  as is often the case in switzerland  appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.
Frankenstein,the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town  over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of cop  t. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes  and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the m  le  a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.
Frankenstein,while i watched the tempest  so beautiful yet terrific  i wandered on with a hasty step.
Frankenstein,this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits  i clasped my hands  and exclaimed aloud     william  dear angel  this is thy funeral  this thy dirge    as i said these words  i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me  i stood fixed  gazing intently  i could not be mistaken.
Frankenstein,a flash of lightning illuminated the object  and discovered its shape plainly to me  its gigantic stature  and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity  instantly informed me that it was the wretch  the filthy d  mon  to whom i had given life.
Frankenstein,what did he there  could he be  i shuddered at the conception  the murderer of my brother  no sooner did that idea cross my imagination  than i became convinced of its truth  my teeth chattered  and i was forced to lean against a tree for support.
Frankenstein,the figure passed me quickly  and i lost it in the gloom.
Frankenstein,nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.
Frankenstein,he was the murderer  i could not doubt it.
Frankenstein,the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
Frankenstein,i thought of pursuing the devil  but it would have been in vain  for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont sal  ve  a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south.
Frankenstein,he soon reached the summit  and disappeared.
Frankenstein,i remained motionless.
Frankenstein,the thunder ceased  but the rain still continued  and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.
Frankenstein,i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget  the whole train of my progress toward the creation  the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside  its departure.
Frankenstein,two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life  and was this his first crime  alas  i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch  whose delight was in carnage and misery  had he not murdered my brother   no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night  which i spent  cold and wet  in the open air.
Frankenstein,but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather  my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
Frankenstein,i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind  and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror  such as the deed which he had now done  nearly in the light of my own vampire  my own spirit let loose from the grave  and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.
Frankenstein,day dawned  and i directed my steps towards the town.
Frankenstein,the gates were open  and i hastened to my father   s house.
Frankenstein,my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer  and cause instant pursuit to be made.
Frankenstein,but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell.
Frankenstein,a being whom i myself had formed  and endued with life  had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.
Frankenstein,i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation  and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.
Frankenstein,i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me  i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.
Frankenstein,besides  the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit  even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.
Frankenstein,and then of what use would be pursuit  who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont sal  ve  these reflections determined me  and i resolved to remain silent.
Frankenstein,it was about five in the morning when i entered my father   s house.
Frankenstein,i told the servants not to disturb the family  and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.
Frankenstein,six years had elapsed  passed in a dream but for one indelible trace  and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,beloved and venerable parent  he still remained to me.
Frankenstein,i gazed on the picture of my mother  which stood over the mantel piece.
Frankenstein,it was an historical subject  painted at my father   s desire  and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair  kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.
Frankenstein,her garb was rustic  and her cheek pale  but there was an air of dignity and beauty  that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.
Frankenstein,below this picture was a miniature of william  and my tears flowed when i looked upon it.
Frankenstein,while i was thus engaged  ernest entered  he had heard me arrive  and hastened to welcome me     welcome  my dearest victor    said he.
Frankenstein,ah  i wish you had come three months ago  and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
Frankenstein,you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate  yet your presence will  i hope  revive our father  who seems sinking under his misfortune  and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self accusations.
Frankenstein,poor william  he was our darling and our pride     tears  unrestrained  fell from my brother   s eyes  a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.
Frankenstein,before  i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home  the reality came on me as a new  and a not less terrible  disaster.
Frankenstein,i tried to calm ernest  i enquired more minutely concerning my father  and here i named my cousin.
Frankenstein,she most of all    said ernest     requires consolation  she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother  and that made her very wretched.
Frankenstein,but since the murderer has been discovered          the murderer discovered  good god  how can that be  who could attempt to pursue him  it is impossible  one might as well try to overtake the winds  or confine a mountain stream with a straw.
Frankenstein,i saw him too  he was free last night        i do not know what you mean    replied my brother  in accents of wonder     but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.
Frankenstein,no one would believe it at first  and even now elizabeth will not be convinced  notwithstanding all the evidence.
Frankenstein,indeed  who would credit that justine moritz  who was so amiable  and fond of all the family  could suddenly become so capable of so frightful  so appalling a crime        justine moritz  poor  poor girl  is she the accused  but it is wrongfully  every one knows that  no one believes it  surely  ernest        no one did at first  but several circumstances came out  that have almost forced conviction upon us  and her own behaviour has been so confused  as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that  i fear  leaves no hope for doubt.
Frankenstein,but she will be tried today  and you will then hear all.
Frankenstein,he then related that  the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered  justine had been taken ill  and confined to her bed for several days.
Frankenstein,during this interval  one of the servants  happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder  had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother  which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.
Frankenstein,the servant instantly showed it to one of the others  who  without saying a word to any of the family  went to a magistrate  and  upon their deposition  justine was apprehended.
Frankenstein,on being charged with the fact  the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.
Frankenstein,this was a strange tale  but it did not shake my faith  and i replied earnestly     you are all mistaken  i know the murderer.
Frankenstein,justine  poor  good justine  is innocent.
Frankenstein,at that instant my father entered.
Frankenstein,i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance  but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully  and  after we had exchanged our mournful greeting  would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster  had not ernest exclaimed     good god  papa  victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william.
Frankenstein,we do also  unfortunately    replied my father     for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly.
Frankenstein,my dear father  you are mistaken  justine is innocent.
Frankenstein,if she is  god forbid that she should suffer as guilty.
Frankenstein,she is to be tried today  and i hope  i sincerely hope  that she will be acquitted.
Frankenstein,this speech calmed me.
Frankenstein,i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine  and indeed every human being  was guiltless of this murder.
Frankenstein,i had no fear  therefore  that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.
Frankenstein,my tale was not one to announce publicly  its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.
Frankenstein,did any one indeed exist  except i  the creator  who would believe  unless his senses convinced him  in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world   we were soon joined by elizabeth.
Frankenstein,time had altered her since i last beheld her  it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.
Frankenstein,there was the same candour  the same vivacity  but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
Frankenstein,she welcomed me with the greatest affection.
Frankenstein,your arrival  my dear cousin    said she     fills me with hope.
Frankenstein,you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine.
Frankenstein,alas  who is safe  if she be convicted of crime  i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own.
Frankenstein,our misfortune is doubly hard to us  we have not only lost that lovely darling boy  but this poor girl  whom i sincerely love  is to be torn away by even a worse fate.
Frankenstein,if she is condemned  i never shall know joy more.
Frankenstein,but she will not  i am sure she will not  and then i shall be happy again  even after the sad death of my little william.
Frankenstein,she is innocent  my elizabeth    said i     and that shall be proved  fear nothing  but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.
Frankenstein,how kind and generous you are  every one else believes in her guilt  and that made me wretched  for i knew that it was impossible  and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.
Frankenstein,she wept.
Frankenstein,dearest niece    said my father     dry your tears.
Frankenstein,if she is  as you believe  innocent  rely on the justice of our laws  and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.
Frankenstein,we passed a few sad hours until eleven o   clock  when the trial was to commence.
Frankenstein,my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses  i accompanied them to the court.
Frankenstein,during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture.
Frankenstein,it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings  one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy  the other far more dreadfully murdered  with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
Frankenstein,justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy  now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave  and i the cause  a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine  but i was absent when it was committed  and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.
Frankenstein,the appearance of justine was calm.
Frankenstein,she was dressed in mourning  and her countenance  always engaging  was rendered  by the solemnity of her feelings  exquisitely beautiful.
Frankenstein,yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble  although gazed on and execrated by thousands  for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.
Frankenstein,she was tranquil  yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained  and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt  she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
Frankenstein,when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.
Frankenstein,a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us  but she quickly recovered herself  and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.
Frankenstein,the trial began  and after the advocate against her had stated the charge  several witnesses were called.
Frankenstein,several strange facts combined against her  which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had.
Frankenstein,she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.
Frankenstein,the woman asked her what she did there  but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.
Frankenstein,she returned to the house about eight o   clock  and when one inquired where she had passed the night  she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.
Frankenstein,when shown the body  she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.
Frankenstein,the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket  and when elizabeth  in a faltering voice  proved that it was the same which  an hour before the child had been missed  she had placed round his neck  a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
Frankenstein,justine was called on for her defence.
Frankenstein,as the trial had proceeded  her countenance had altered.
Frankenstein,surprise  horror  and misery were strongly expressed.
Frankenstein,sometimes she struggled with her tears  but when she was desired to plead  she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.
Frankenstein,god knows    she said     how entirely i am innocent.
Frankenstein,but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me  i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me  and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.
Frankenstein,she then related that  by the permission of elizabeth  she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at ch  ne  a village situated at about a league from geneva.
Frankenstein,on her return  at about nine o   clock  she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.
Frankenstein,she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him  when the gates of geneva were shut  and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage  being unwilling to call up the inhabitants  to whom she was well known.
Frankenstein,most of the night she spent here watching  towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes  some steps disturbed her  and she awoke.
Frankenstein,it was dawn  and she quitted her asylum  that she might again endeavour to find my brother.
Frankenstein,if she had gone near the spot where his body lay  it was without her knowledge.
Frankenstein,that she had been bewildered when questioned by the market woman was not surprising  since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain.
Frankenstein,concerning the picture she could give no account.
Frankenstein,i know    continued the unhappy victim     how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me  but i have no power of explaining it  and when i have expressed my utter ignorance  i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.
Frankenstein,but here also i am checked.
Frankenstein,i believe that i have no enemy on earth  and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
Frankenstein,did the murderer place it there  i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing  or  if i had  why should he have stolen the jewel  to part with it again so soon      i commit my cause to the justice of my judges  yet i see no room for hope.
Frankenstein,i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character  and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt  i must be condemned  although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence.
Frankenstein,several witnesses were called who had known her for many years  and they spoke well of her  but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.
Frankenstein,elizabeth saw even this last resource  her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct  about to fail the accused  when  although violently agitated  she desired permission to address the court.
Frankenstein,i am    said she     the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered  or rather his sister  for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.
Frankenstein,it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion  but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends  i wish to be allowed to speak  that i may say what i know of her character.
Frankenstein,i am well acquainted with the accused.
Frankenstein,i have lived in the same house with her  at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.
Frankenstein,during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.
Frankenstein,she nursed madame frankenstein  my aunt  in her last illness  with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness  in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her  after which she again lived in my uncle   s house  where she was beloved by all the family.
Frankenstein,she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.
Frankenstein,for my own part  i do not hesitate to say that  notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her  i believe and rely on her perfect innocence.
Frankenstein,she had no temptation for such an action  as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests  if she had earnestly desired it  i should have willingly given it to her  so much do i esteem and value her.
Frankenstein,a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth   s simple and powerful appeal  but it was excited by her generous interference  and not in favour of poor justine  on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence  charging her with the blackest ingratitude.
Frankenstein,she herself wept as elizabeth spoke  but she did not answer.
Frankenstein,my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.
Frankenstein,i believed in her innocence  i knew it.
Frankenstein,could the d  mon who had  i did not for a minute doubt  murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy  i could not sustain the horror of my situation  and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim  i rushed out of the court in agony.
Frankenstein,the tortures of the accused did not equal mine  she was sustained by innocence  but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
Frankenstein,i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.
Frankenstein,in the morning i went to the court  my lips and throat were parched.
Frankenstein,i dared not ask the fatal question  but i was known  and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.
Frankenstein,the ballots had been thrown  they were all black  and justine was condemned.
Frankenstein,i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt.
Frankenstein,i had before experienced sensations of horror  and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions  but words cannot convey an idea of the heart sickening despair that i then endured.
Frankenstein,the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt.
Frankenstein,that evidence    he observed     was hardly required in so glaring a case  but i am glad of it  and  indeed  none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence  be it ever so decisive.
Frankenstein,this was strange and unexpected intelligence  what could it mean  had my eyes deceived me  and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions  i hastened to return home  and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
Frankenstein,my cousin    replied i     it is decided as you may have expected  all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.
Frankenstein,but she has confessed.
Frankenstein,this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth  who had relied with firmness upon justine   s innocence.
Frankenstein,alas    said she.
Frankenstein,how shall i ever again believe in human goodness  justine  whom i loved and esteemed as my sister  how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray  her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile  and yet she has committed a murder.
Frankenstein,soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.
Frankenstein,my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.
Frankenstein,yes    said elizabeth     i will go  although she is guilty  and you  victor  shall accompany me  i cannot go alone.
Frankenstein,the idea of this visit was torture to me  yet i could not refuse.
Frankenstein,we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end  her hands were manacled  and her head rested on her knees.
Frankenstein,she rose on seeing us enter  and when we were left alone with her  she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth  weeping bitterly.
Frankenstein,my cousin wept also.
Frankenstein,oh  justine    said she.
Frankenstein,why did you rob me of my last consolation  i relied on your innocence  and although i was then very wretched  i was not so miserable as i am now.
Frankenstein,and do you also believe that i am so very  very wicked  do you also join with my enemies to crush me  to condemn me as a murderer    her voice was suffocated with sobs.
Frankenstein,rise  my poor girl    said elizabeth     why do you kneel  if you are innocent  i am not one of your enemies  i believed you guiltless  notwithstanding every evidence  until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
Frankenstein,that report  you say  is false  and be assured  dear justine  that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment  but your own confession.
Frankenstein,i did confess  but i confessed a lie.
Frankenstein,i confessed  that i might obtain absolution  but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.
Frankenstein,the god of heaven forgive me  ever since i was condemned  my confessor has besieged me  he threatened and menaced  until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was.
Frankenstein,he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate.
Frankenstein,dear lady  i had none to support me  all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.
Frankenstein,what could i do  in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie  and now only am i truly miserable.
Frankenstein,she paused  weeping  and then continued     i thought with horror  my sweet lady  that you should believe your justine  whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured  and whom you loved  was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
Frankenstein,dear william  dearest blessed child  i soon shall see you again in heaven  where we shall all be happy  and that consoles me  going as i am to suffer ignominy and death.
Frankenstein,oh  justine  forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
Frankenstein,why did you confess  but do not mourn  dear girl.
Frankenstein,do not fear.
Frankenstein,i will proclaim  i will prove your innocence.
Frankenstein,i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.
Frankenstein,you shall not die  you  my playfellow  my companion  my sister  perish on the scaffold  no  no  i never could survive so horrible a misfortune.
Frankenstein,justine shook her head mournfully.
Frankenstein,i do not fear to die    she said     that pang is past.
Frankenstein,god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.
Frankenstein,i leave a sad and bitter world  and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned  i am resigned to the fate awaiting me.
Frankenstein,learn from me  dear lady  to submit in patience to the will of heaven     during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room  where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.
Frankenstein,despair  who dared talk of that  the poor victim  who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death  felt not  as i did  such deep and bitter agony.
Frankenstein,i gnashed my teeth and ground them together  uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.
Frankenstein,justine started.
Frankenstein,when she saw who it was  she approached me and said     dear sir  you are very kind to visit me  you  i hope  do not believe that i am guilty     i could not answer.
Frankenstein,no  justine    said elizabeth     he is more convinced of your innocence than i was  for even when he heard that you had confessed  he did not credit it.
Frankenstein,i truly thank him.
Frankenstein,in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.
Frankenstein,how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am  it removes more than half my misfortune  and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you  dear lady  and your cousin.
Frankenstein,thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.
Frankenstein,she indeed gained the resignation she desired.
Frankenstein,but i  the true murderer  felt the never dying worm alive in my bosom  which allowed of no hope or consolation.
Frankenstein,elizabeth also wept and was unhappy  but hers also was the misery of innocence  which  like a cloud that passes over the fair moon  for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.
Frankenstein,anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart  i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.
Frankenstein,we stayed several hours with justine  and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away.
Frankenstein,i wish    cried she     that i were to die with you  i cannot live in this world of misery.
Frankenstein,justine assumed an air of cheerfulness  while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.
Frankenstein,she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half suppressed emotion     farewell  sweet lady  dearest elizabeth  my beloved and only friend  may heaven  in its bounty  bless and preserve you  may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer  live  and be happy  and make others so.
Frankenstein,and on the morrow justine died.
Frankenstein,elizabeth   s heart rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.
Frankenstein,my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.
Frankenstein,and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh  unfeeling reasoning of these men  my purposed avowal died away on my lips.
Frankenstein,thus i might proclaim myself a madman  but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.
Frankenstein,she perished on the scaffold as a murderess   from the tortures of my own heart  i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth.
Frankenstein,this also was my doing  and my father   s woe  and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice accursed hands  ye weep  unhappy ones  but these are not your last tears  again shall you raise the funeral wail  and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard  frankenstein  your son  your kinsman  your early  much loved friend  he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes  who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances  who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you   he bids you weep  to shed countless tears  happy beyond his hopes  if thus inexorable fate be satisfied  and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments   thus spoke my prophetic soul  as  torn by remorse  horror  and despair  i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine  the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
Frankenstein,nothing is more painful to the human mind than  after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events  the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
Frankenstein,justine died  she rested  and i was alive.
Frankenstein,the blood flowed freely in my veins  but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.
Frankenstein,sleep fled from my eyes  i wandered like an evil spirit  for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible  and more  much more  i persuaded myself  was yet behind.
Frankenstein,yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
Frankenstein,i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.
Frankenstein,now all was blasted  instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self satisfaction  and from thence to gather promise of new hopes  i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt  which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.
Frankenstein,this state of mind preyed upon my health  which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.
Frankenstein,i shunned the face of man  all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me  solitude was my only consolation   deep  dark  deathlike solitude.
Frankenstein,my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
Frankenstein,do you think  victor    said he     that i do not suffer also  no one could love a child more than i loved your brother     tears came into his eyes as he spoke      but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief  it is also a duty owed to yourself  for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment  or even the discharge of daily usefulness  without which no man is fit for society.
Frankenstein,this advice  although good  was totally inapplicable to my case  i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness  and terror its alarm  with my other sensations.
Frankenstein,now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
Frankenstein,about this time we retired to our house at belrive.
Frankenstein,this change was particularly agreeable to me.
Frankenstein,the shutting of the gates regularly at ten o   clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me.
Frankenstein,i was now free.
Frankenstein,often  after the rest of the family had retired for the night  i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.
Frankenstein,sometimes  with my sails set  i was carried by the wind  and sometimes  after rowing into the middle of the lake  i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.
Frankenstein,i was often tempted  when all was at peace around me  and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly   if i except some bat  or the frogs  whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore   often  i say  i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake  that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.
Frankenstein,but i was restrained  when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth  whom i tenderly loved  and whose existence was bound up in mine.
Frankenstein,i thought also of my father and surviving brother  should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them   at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness.
Frankenstein,but that could not be.
Frankenstein,remorse extinguished every hope.
Frankenstein,i had been the author of unalterable evils  and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.
Frankenstein,i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime  which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
Frankenstein,there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind.
Frankenstein,my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.
Frankenstein,when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth  my eyes became inflamed  and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed.
Frankenstein,when i reflected on his crimes and malice  my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.
Frankenstein,i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes  could i  when there  have precipitated him to their base.
Frankenstein,i wished to see him again  that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine.
Frankenstein,our house was the house of mourning.
Frankenstein,my father   s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.
Frankenstein,elizabeth was sad and desponding  she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations  all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead  eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.
Frankenstein,she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.
Frankenstein,the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her  and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.
Frankenstein,when i reflect  my dear cousin    said she     on the miserable death of justine moritz  i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.
Frankenstein,before  i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils  at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination  but now misery has come home  and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other   s blood.
Frankenstein,yet i am certainly unjust.
Frankenstein,everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty  and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered  assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.
Frankenstein,for the sake of a few jewels  to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend  a child whom she had nursed from its birth  and appeared to love as if it had been her own  i could not consent to the death of any human being  but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.
Frankenstein,but she was innocent.
Frankenstein,i know  i feel she was innocent  you are of the same opinion  and that confirms me.
Frankenstein,alas  victor  when falsehood can look so like the truth  who can assure themselves of certain happiness  i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice  towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.
Frankenstein,william and justine were assassinated  and the murderer escapes  he walks about the world free  and perhaps respected.
Frankenstein,but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes  i would not change places with such a wretch.
Frankenstein,i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.
Frankenstein,i  not in deed  but in effect  was the true murderer.
Frankenstein,elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance  and kindly taking my hand  said     my dearest friend  you must calm yourself.
Frankenstein,these events have affected me  god knows how deeply  but i am not so wretched as you are.
Frankenstein,there is an expression of despair  and sometimes of revenge  in your countenance that makes me tremble.
Frankenstein,dear victor  banish these dark passions.
Frankenstein,remember the friends around you  who centre all their hopes in you.
Frankenstein,have we lost the power of rendering you happy  ah  while we love  while we are true to each other  here in this land of peace and beauty  your native country  we may reap every tranquil blessing   what can disturb our peace     and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart  even as she spoke i drew near to her  as if in terror  lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
Frankenstein,thus not the tenderness of friendship  nor the beauty of earth  nor of heaven  could redeem my soul from woe  the very accents of love were ineffectual.
Frankenstein,i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
Frankenstein,the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake  there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it  and to die  was but a type of me.
Frankenstein,sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me  but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek  by bodily exercise and by change of place  some relief from my intolerable sensations.
Frankenstein,it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home  and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys  sought in the magnificence  the eternity of such scenes  to forget myself and my ephemeral  because human  sorrows.
Frankenstein,my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix.
Frankenstein,i had visited it frequently during my boyhood.
Frankenstein,six years had passed since then  i was a wreck  but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
Frankenstein,i performed the first part of my journey on horseback.
Frankenstein,i afterwards hired a mule  as the more sure footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.
Frankenstein,the weather was fine  it was about the middle of the month of august  nearly two months after the death of justine  that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe.
Frankenstein,the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve.
Frankenstein,the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side  the sound of the river raging among the rocks  and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence   and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements  here displayed in their most terrific guise.
Frankenstein,still  as i ascended higher  the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
Frankenstein,ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains  the impetuous arve  and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.
Frankenstein,but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps  whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all  as belonging to another earth  the habitations of another race of beings.
Frankenstein,i passed the bridge of p  lissier  where the ravine  which the river forms  opened before me  and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.
Frankenstein,soon after  i entered the valley of chamounix.
Frankenstein,this valley is more wonderful and sublime  but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox  through which i had just passed.
Frankenstein,the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries  but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.
Frankenstein,immense glaciers approached the road  i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.
Frankenstein,mont blanc  the supreme and magnificent mont blanc  raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles  and its tremendous d  me overlooked the valley.
Frankenstein,a tingling long lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.
Frankenstein,some turn in the road  some new object suddenly perceived and recognised  reminded me of days gone by  and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.
Frankenstein,the very winds whispered in soothing accents  and maternal nature bade me weep no more.
Frankenstein,then again the kindly influence ceased to act   i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.
Frankenstein,then i spurred on my animal  striving so to forget the world  my fears  and more than all  myself   or  in a more desperate fashion  i alighted and threw myself on the grass  weighed down by horror and despair.
Frankenstein,at length i arrived at the village of chamounix.
Frankenstein,exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured.
Frankenstein,for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve  which pursued its noisy way beneath.
Frankenstein,the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations  when i placed my head upon my pillow  sleep crept over me  i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.
Frankenstein,i spent the following day roaming through the valley.
Frankenstein,i stood beside the sources of the arveiron  which take their rise in a glacier  that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.
Frankenstein,the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me  the icy wall of the glacier overhung me  a few shattered pines were scattered around  and the solemn silence of this glorious presence chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment  the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking  reverberated along the mountains  of the accumulated ice  which  through the silent working of immutable laws  was ever and anon rent and torn  as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.
Frankenstein,these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving.
Frankenstein,they elevated me from all littleness of feeling  and although they did not remove my grief  they subdued and tranquillised it.
Frankenstein,in some degree  also  they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.
Frankenstein,i retired to rest at night  my slumbers  as it were  waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day.
Frankenstein,they congregated round me  the unstained snowy mountain top  the glittering pinnacle  the pine woods  and ragged bare ravine  the eagle  soaring amidst the clouds   they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
Frankenstein,where had they fled when the next morning i awoke  all of soul inspiriting fled with sleep  and dark melancholy clouded every thought.
Frankenstein,the rain was pouring in torrents  and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains  so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.
Frankenstein,still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.
Frankenstein,what were rain and storm to me  my mule was brought to the door  and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert.
Frankenstein,i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it.
Frankenstein,it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
Frankenstein,the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.
Frankenstein,i determined to go without a guide  for i was well acquainted with the path  and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
Frankenstein,the ascent is precipitous  but the path is cut into continual and short windings  which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.
Frankenstein,it is a scene terrifically desolate.
Frankenstein,in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived  where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground  some entirely destroyed  others bent  leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.
Frankenstein,the path  as you ascend higher  is intersected by ravines of snow  down which stones continually roll from above  one of them is particularly dangerous  as the slightest sound  such as even speaking in a loud voice  produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.
Frankenstein,the pines are not tall or luxuriant  but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
Frankenstein,i looked on the valley beneath  vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains  whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds  while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me.
Frankenstein,alas  why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute  it only renders them more necessary beings.
Frankenstein,if our impulses were confined to hunger  thirst  and desire  we might be nearly free  but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.
Frankenstein,we rest  a dream has power to poison sleep.
Frankenstein,we rise  one wand   ring thought pollutes the day.
Frankenstein,we feel  conceive  or reason  laugh or weep      embrace fond woe  or cast our cares away  it is the same  for  be it joy or sorrow      the path of its departure still is free.
Frankenstein,man   s yesterday may ne   er be like his morrow      nought may endure but mutability   it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent.
Frankenstein,for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
Frankenstein,a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.
Frankenstein,presently a breeze dissipated the cloud  and i descended upon the glacier.
Frankenstein,the surface is very uneven  rising like the waves of a troubled sea  descending low  and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
Frankenstein,the field of ice is almost a league in width  but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it.
Frankenstein,the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.
Frankenstein,from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite  at the distance of a league  and above it rose mont blanc  in awful majesty.
Frankenstein,i remained in a recess of the rock  gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.
Frankenstein,the sea  or rather the vast river of ice  wound among its dependent mountains  whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.
Frankenstein,their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.
Frankenstein,my heart  which was before sorrowful  now swelled with something like joy  i exclaimed     wandering spirits  if indeed ye wander  and do not rest in your narrow beds  allow me this faint happiness  or take me  as your companion  away from the joys of life.
Frankenstein,as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man  at some distance  advancing towards me with superhuman speed.
Frankenstein,he bounded over the crevices in the ice  among which i had walked with caution  his stature  also  as he approached  seemed to exceed that of man.
Frankenstein,i was troubled  a mist came over my eyes  and i felt a faintness seize me  but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.
Frankenstein,i perceived  as the shape came nearer  sight tremendous and abhorred   that it was the wretch whom i had created.
Frankenstein,i trembled with rage and horror  resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.
Frankenstein,he approached  his countenance bespoke bitter anguish  combined with disdain and malignity  while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.
Frankenstein,but i scarcely observed this  rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance  and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
Frankenstein,devil    i exclaimed     do you dare approach me  and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head  begone  vile insect  or rather  stay  that i may trample you to dust  and  oh  that i could  with the extinction of your miserable existence  restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered        i expected this reception    said the d  mon.
Frankenstein,all men hate the wretched  how  then  must i be hated  who am miserable beyond all living things  yet you  my creator  detest and spurn me  thy creature  to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.
Frankenstein,you purpose to kill me.
Frankenstein,how dare you sport thus with life  do your duty towards me  and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.
Frankenstein,if you will comply with my conditions  i will leave them and you at peace  but if you refuse  i will glut the maw of death  until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.
Frankenstein,abhorred monster  fiend that thou art  the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.
Frankenstein,wretched devil  you reproach me with your creation  come on  then  that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed.
Frankenstein,my rage was without bounds  i sprang on him  impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
Frankenstein,he easily eluded me and said      be calm  i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.
Frankenstein,have i not suffered enough  that you seek to increase my misery  life  although it may only be an accumulation of anguish  is dear to me  and i will defend it.
Frankenstein,remember  thou hast made me more powerful than thyself  my height is superior to thine  my joints more supple.
Frankenstein,but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.
Frankenstein,i am thy creature  and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part  the which thou owest me.
Frankenstein,oh  frankenstein  be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone  to whom thy justice  and even thy clemency and affection  is most due.
Frankenstein,remember that i am thy creature  i ought to be thy adam  but i am rather the fallen angel  whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.
Frankenstein,everywhere i see bliss  from which i alone am irrevocably excluded.
Frankenstein,i was benevolent and good  misery made me a fiend.
Frankenstein,make me happy  and i shall again be virtuous.
Frankenstein,begone  i will not hear you.
Frankenstein,there can be no community between you and me  we are enemies.
Frankenstein,begone  or let us try our strength in a fight  in which one must fall.
Frankenstein,how can i move thee  will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature  who implores thy goodness and compassion  believe me  frankenstein  i was benevolent  my soul glowed with love and humanity  but am i not alone  miserably alone  you  my creator  abhor me  what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures  who owe me nothing  they spurn and hate me.
Frankenstein,the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.
Frankenstein,i have wandered here many days  the caves of ice  which i only do not fear  are a dwelling to me  and the only one which man does not grudge.
Frankenstein,these bleak skies i hail  for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.
Frankenstein,if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence  they would do as you do  and arm themselves for my destruction.
Frankenstein,shall i not then hate them who abhor me  i will keep no terms with my enemies.
Frankenstein,i am miserable  and they shall share my wretchedness.
Frankenstein,yet it is in your power to recompense me  and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great  that not only you and your family  but thousands of others  shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.
Frankenstein,let your compassion be moved  and do not disdain me.
Frankenstein,listen to my tale  when you have heard that  abandon or commiserate me  as you shall judge that i deserve.
Frankenstein,but hear me.
Frankenstein,the guilty are allowed  by human laws  bloody as they are  to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.
Frankenstein,listen to me  frankenstein.
Frankenstein,you accuse me of murder  and yet you would  with a satisfied conscience  destroy your own creature.
Frankenstein,oh  praise the eternal justice of man  yet i ask you not to spare me  listen to me  and then  if you can  and if you will  destroy the work of your hands.
Frankenstein,why do you call to my remembrance    i rejoined     circumstances of which i shudder to reflect  that i have been the miserable origin and author  cursed be the day  abhorred devil  in which you first saw light  cursed  although i curse myself  be the hands that formed you  you have made me wretched beyond expression.
Frankenstein,you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not.
Frankenstein,begone  relieve me from the sight of your detested form.
Frankenstein,thus i relieve thee  my creator    he said  and placed his hated hands before my eyes  which i flung from me with violence     thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor.
Frankenstein,still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.
Frankenstein,by the virtues that i once possessed  i demand this from you.
Frankenstein,hear my tale  it is long and strange  and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations  come to the hut upon the mountain.
Frankenstein,the sun is yet high in the heavens  before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world  you will have heard my story and can decide.
Frankenstein,on you it rests  whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life  or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.
Frankenstein,as he said this he led the way across the ice  i followed.
Frankenstein,my heart was full  and i did not answer him  but as i proceeded  i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.
Frankenstein,i was partly urged by curiosity  and compassion confirmed my resolution.
Frankenstein,i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother  and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
Frankenstein,for the first time  also  i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were  and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness.
Frankenstein,these motives urged me to comply with his demand.
Frankenstein,we crossed the ice  therefore  and ascended the opposite rock.
Frankenstein,the air was cold  and the rain again began to descend  we entered the hut  the fiend with an air of exultation  i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.
Frankenstein,but i consented to listen  and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted  he thus began his tale.
Frankenstein,it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being  all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
Frankenstein,a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me  and i saw  felt  heard  and smelt at the same time  and it was  indeed  a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.
Frankenstein,by degrees  i remember  a stronger light pressed upon my nerves  so that i was obliged to shut my eyes.
Frankenstein,darkness then came over me and troubled me  but hardly had i felt this when  by opening my eyes  as i now suppose  the light poured in upon me again.
Frankenstein,i walked and  i believe  descended  but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Frankenstein,before  dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me  impervious to my touch or sight  but i now found that i could wander on at liberty  with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid.
Frankenstein,the light became more and more oppressive to me  and the heat wearying me as i walked  i sought a place where i could receive shade.
Frankenstein,this was the forest near ingolstadt  and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue  until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst.
Frankenstein,this roused me from my nearly dormant state  and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.
Frankenstein,i slaked my thirst at the brook  and then lying down  was overcome by sleep.
Frankenstein,it was dark when i awoke  i felt cold also  and half frightened  as it were  instinctively  finding myself so desolate.
Frankenstein,before i had quitted your apartment  on a sensation of cold  i had covered myself with some clothes  but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.
Frankenstein,i was a poor  helpless  miserable wretch  i knew  and could distinguish  nothing  but feeling pain invade me on all sides  i sat down and wept.
Frankenstein,soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.
Frankenstein,i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.
Frankenstein,the moon  i gazed with a kind of wonder.
Frankenstein,it moved slowly  but it enlightened my path  and i again went out in search of berries.
Frankenstein,i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak  with which i covered myself  and sat down upon the ground.
Frankenstein,no distinct ideas occupied my mind  all was confused.
Frankenstein,i felt light  and hunger  and thirst  and darkness  innumerable sounds rang in my ears  and on all sides various scents saluted me  the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon  and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.
Frankenstein,several changes of day and night passed  and the orb of night had greatly lessened  when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other.
Frankenstein,i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.
Frankenstein,i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound  which often saluted my ears  proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.
Frankenstein,i began also to observe  with greater accuracy  the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.
Frankenstein,sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
Frankenstein,sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode  but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.
Frankenstein,the moon had disappeared from the night  and again  with a lessened form  showed itself  while i still remained in the forest.
Frankenstein,my sensations had by this time become distinct  and my mind received every day additional ideas.
Frankenstein,my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms  i distinguished the insect from the herb  and by degrees  one herb from another.
Frankenstein,i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes  whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.
Frankenstein,one day  when i was oppressed by cold  i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars  and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it.
Frankenstein,in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers  but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.
Frankenstein,how strange  i thought  that the same cause should produce such opposite effects  i examined the materials of the fire  and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.
Frankenstein,i quickly collected some branches  but they were wet and would not burn.
Frankenstein,i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.
Frankenstein,the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.
Frankenstein,i reflected on this  and by touching the various branches  i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood  that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.
Frankenstein,when night came on and brought sleep with it  i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.
Frankenstein,i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it  and then  spreading my cloak  i lay on the ground and sank into sleep.
Frankenstein,it was morning when i awoke  and my first care was to visit the fire.
Frankenstein,i uncovered it  and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.
Frankenstein,i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches  which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.
Frankenstein,when night came again i found  with pleasure  that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food  for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted  and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees.
Frankenstein,i tried  therefore  to dress my food in the same manner  placing it on the live embers.
Frankenstein,i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation  and the nuts and roots much improved.
Frankenstein,food  however  became scarce  and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.
Frankenstein,when i found this  i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited  to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied.
Frankenstein,in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.
Frankenstein,i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty  but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it  and wrapping myself up in my cloak  i struck across the wood towards the setting sun.
Frankenstein,i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.
Frankenstein,a great fall of snow had taken place the night before  and the fields were of one uniform white  the appearance was disconsolate  and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.
Frankenstein,it was about seven in the morning  and i longed to obtain food and shelter  at length i perceived a small hut  on a rising ground  which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.
Frankenstein,this was a new sight to me  and i examined the structure with great curiosity.
Frankenstein,finding the door open  i entered.
Frankenstein,an old man sat in it  near a fire  over which he was preparing his breakfast.
Frankenstein,he turned on hearing a noise  and perceiving me  shrieked loudly  and quitting the hut  ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.
Frankenstein,his appearance  different from any i had ever before seen  and his flight somewhat surprised me.
Frankenstein,but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut  here the snow and rain could not penetrate  the ground was dry  and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pand  monium appeared to the d  mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.
Frankenstein,i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd   s breakfast  which consisted of bread  cheese  milk  and wine  the latter  however  i did not like.
Frankenstein,then  overcome by fatigue  i lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
Frankenstein,it was noon when i awoke  and allured by the warmth of the sun  which shone brightly on the white ground  i determined to recommence my travels  and  depositing the remains of the peasant   s breakfast in a wallet i found  i proceeded across the fields for several hours  until at sunset i arrived at a village.
Frankenstein,how miraculous did this appear  the huts  the neater cottages  and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.
Frankenstein,the vegetables in the gardens  the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages  allured my appetite.
Frankenstein,one of the best of these i entered  but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked  and one of the women fainted.
Frankenstein,the whole village was roused  some fled  some attacked me  until  grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons  i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel  quite bare  and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village.
Frankenstein,this hovel however  joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance  but after my late dearly bought experience  i dared not enter it.
Frankenstein,my place of refuge was constructed of wood  but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it.
Frankenstein,no wood  however  was placed on the earth  which formed the floor  but it was dry  and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks  i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
Frankenstein,here  then  i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter  however miserable  from the inclemency of the season  and still more from the barbarity of man.
Frankenstein,as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel  that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found.
Frankenstein,it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.
Frankenstein,one part was open  and by that i had crept in  but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood  yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out  all the light i enjoyed came through the sty  and that was sufficient for me.
Frankenstein,having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw  i retired  for i saw the figure of a man at a distance  and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.
Frankenstein,i had first  however  provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread  which i purloined  and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.
Frankenstein,the floor was a little raised  so that it was kept perfectly dry  and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.
Frankenstein,being thus provided  i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.
Frankenstein,it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest  my former residence  the rain dropping branches  and dank earth.
Frankenstein,i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step  and looking through a small chink  i beheld a young creature  with a pail on her head  passing before my hovel.
Frankenstein,the girl was young and of gentle demeanour  unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.
Frankenstein,yet she was meanly dressed  a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb  her fair hair was plaited but not adorned  she looked patient yet sad.
Frankenstein,i lost sight of her  and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail  which was now partly filled with milk.
Frankenstein,as she walked along  seemingly incommoded by the burden  a young man met her  whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.
Frankenstein,uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy  he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.
Frankenstein,she followed  and they disappeared.
Frankenstein,presently i saw the young man again  with some tools in his hand  cross the field behind the cottage  and the girl was also busied  sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.
Frankenstein,on examining my dwelling  i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it  but the panes had been filled up with wood.
Frankenstein,in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
Frankenstein,through this crevice a small room was visible  whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.
Frankenstein,in one corner  near a small fire  sat an old man  leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.
Frankenstein,the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage  but presently she took something out of a drawer  which employed her hands  and she sat down beside the old man  who  taking up an instrument  began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.
Frankenstein,it was a lovely sight  even to me  poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.
Frankenstein,the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence  while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.
Frankenstein,he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion  of which the old man took no notice  until she sobbed audibly  he then pronounced a few sounds  and the fair creature  leaving her work  knelt at his feet.
Frankenstein,he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature  they were a mixture of pain and pleasure  such as i had never before experienced  either from hunger or cold  warmth or food  and i withdrew from the window  unable to bear these emotions.
Frankenstein,soon after this the young man returned  bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.
Frankenstein,the girl met him at the door  helped to relieve him of his burden  and taking some of the fuel into the cottage  placed it on the fire  then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage  and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.
Frankenstein,she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants  which she placed in water  and then upon the fire.
Frankenstein,she afterwards continued her work  whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.
Frankenstein,after he had been employed thus about an hour  the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.
Frankenstein,the old man had  in the meantime  been pensive  but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air  and they sat down to eat.
Frankenstein,the meal was quickly dispatched.
Frankenstein,the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage  the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes  leaning on the arm of the youth.
Frankenstein,nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.
Frankenstein,one was old  with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love  the younger was slight and graceful in his figure  and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry  yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.
Frankenstein,the old man returned to the cottage  and the youth  with tools different from those he had used in the morning  directed his steps across the fields.
Frankenstein,night quickly shut in  but to my extreme wonder  i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers  and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours.
Frankenstein,in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand  and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.
Frankenstein,so soon as he had finished  the youth began  not to play  but to utter sounds that were monotonous  and neither resembling the harmony of the old man   s instrument nor the songs of the birds  i since found that he read aloud  but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters.
Frankenstein,the family  after having been thus occupied for a short time  extinguished their lights and retired  as i conjectured  to rest.
