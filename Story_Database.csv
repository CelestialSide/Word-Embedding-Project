Title,Story
The Imp of the Perverse, in the consideration of the faculties and impulses of the prima mobilia of the human soul  the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which  although obviously existing as a radical  primitive  irreducible sentiment  has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the pure arrogance of the reason  we have all overlooked it.
The Imp of the Perverse,we have suffered its existence to escape our senses  solely through want of belief of faith  whether it be faith in revelation  or faith in the kabbala.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea of it has never occurred to us  simply because of its supererogation.
The Imp of the Perverse,we saw no need of the impulse for the propensity.
The Imp of the Perverse,we could not perceive its necessity.
The Imp of the Perverse,we could not understand  that is to say  we could not have understood  had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself  we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity  either temporal or eternal.
The Imp of the Perverse,it cannot be denied that phrenology and  in great measure  all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.
The Imp of the Perverse,the intellectual or logical man  rather than the understanding or observant man  set himself to imagine designs to dictate purposes to god.
The Imp of the Perverse,having thus fathomed  to his satisfaction  the intentions of jehovah  out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the matter of phrenology  for example  we first determined  naturally enough  that it was the design of the deity that man should eat.
The Imp of the Perverse,we then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness  and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man  will i nill i  into eating.
The Imp of the Perverse,secondly  having settled it to be god    s will that man should continue his species  we discovered an organ of amativeness  forthwith.
The Imp of the Perverse,and so with combativeness  with ideality  with causality  with constructiveness  so  in short  with every organ  whether representing a propensity  a moral sentiment  or a faculty of the pure intellect.
The Imp of the Perverse,and in these arrangements of the principia of human action  the spurzheimites  whether right or wrong  in part  or upon the whole  have but followed  in principle  the footsteps of their predecessors  deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man  and upon the ground of the objects of his creator.
The Imp of the Perverse,it would have been wiser  it would have been safer  to classify  if classify we must  upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did  and was always occasionally doing  rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the deity intended him to do.
The Imp of the Perverse,if we cannot comprehend god in his visible works  how then in his inconceivable thoughts  that call the works into being  if we cannot understand him in his objective creatures  how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation   induction  a posteriori  would have brought phrenology to admit  as an innate and primitive principle of human action  a paradoxical something  which we may call perverseness  for want of a more characteristic term.
The Imp of the Perverse,in the sense i intend  it is  in fact  a mobile without motive  a motive not motivirt.
The Imp of the Perverse,through its promptings we act without comprehensible object  or  if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms  we may so far modify the proposition as to say  that through its promptings we act  for the reason that we should not.
The Imp of the Perverse,in theory  no reason can be more unreasonable  but  in fact  there is none more strong.
The Imp of the Perverse,with certain minds  under certain conditions  it becomes absolutely irresistible.
The Imp of the Perverse,i am not more certain that i breathe  than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us  and alone impels us to its prosecution.
The Imp of the Perverse,nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong    s sake  admit of analysis  or resolution into ulterior elements.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is a radical  a primitive impulse elementary.
The Imp of the Perverse,it will be said  i am aware  that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them  our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.
The Imp of the Perverse,but a glance will show the fallacy of this idea.
The Imp of the Perverse,the phrenological combativeness has for its essence  the necessity of self defence.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is our safeguard against injury.
The Imp of the Perverse,its principle regards our well being  and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development.
The Imp of the Perverse,it follows  that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness  but in the case of that something which i term perverseness  the desire to be well is not only not aroused  but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.
The Imp of the Perverse,an appeal to one    s own heart is  after all  the best reply to the sophistry just noticed.
The Imp of the Perverse,no one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul  will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is not more incomprehensible than distinctive.
The Imp of the Perverse,there lives no man who at some period has not been tormented  for example  by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution.
The Imp of the Perverse,the speaker is aware that he displeases  he has every intention to please  he is usually curt  precise  and clear  the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue  it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow  he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses  yet  the thought strikes him  that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered.
The Imp of the Perverse,that single thought is enough.
The Imp of the Perverse,the impulse increases to a wish  the wish to a desire  the desire to an uncontrollable longing  and the longing  to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker  and in defiance of all consequences  is indulged.
The Imp of the Perverse,we have a task before us which must be speedily performed.
The Imp of the Perverse,we know that it will be ruinous to make delay.
The Imp of the Perverse,the most important crisis of our life calls  trumpet tongued  for immediate energy and action.
The Imp of the Perverse,we glow  we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work  with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire.
The Imp of the Perverse,it must  it shall be undertaken to day  and yet we put it off until to morrow  and why  there is no answer  except that we feel perverse  using the word with no comprehension of the principle.
The Imp of the Perverse,to morrow arrives  and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty  but with this very increase of anxiety arrives  also  a nameless  a positively fearful  because unfathomable  craving for delay.
The Imp of the Perverse,this craving gathers strength as the moments fly.
The Imp of the Perverse,the last hour for action is at hand.
The Imp of the Perverse,we tremble with the violence of the conflict within us  of the definite with the indefinite of the substance with the shadow.
The Imp of the Perverse,but  if the contest have proceeded thus far  it is the shadow which prevails  we struggle in vain.
The Imp of the Perverse,the clock strikes  and is the knell of our welfare.
The Imp of the Perverse,at the same time  it is the chanticleer note to the ghost that has so long overawed us.
The Imp of the Perverse,it flies it disappears we are free.
The Imp of the Perverse,the old energy returns.
The Imp of the Perverse,we will labor now.
The Imp of the Perverse,alas  it is too late   we stand upon the brink of a precipice.
The Imp of the Perverse,we peer into the abyss we grow sick and dizzy.
The Imp of the Perverse,our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.
The Imp of the Perverse,unaccountably we remain.
The Imp of the Perverse,by slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling.
The Imp of the Perverse,by gradations  still more imperceptible  this cloud assumes shape  as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the arabian nights.
The Imp of the Perverse,but out of this our cloud upon the precipice    s edge  there grows into palpability  a shape  far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale  and yet it is but a thought  although a fearful one  and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height.
The Imp of the Perverse,and this fall this rushing annihilation for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it.
The Imp of the Perverse,and because our reason violently deters us from the brink  therefore do we the most impetuously approach it.
The Imp of the Perverse,there is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient  as that of him who  shuddering upon the edge of a precipice  thus meditates a plunge.
The Imp of the Perverse,to indulge  for a moment  in any attempt at thought  is to be inevitably lost  for reflection but urges us to forbear  and therefore it is  i say  that we cannot.
The Imp of the Perverse,if there be no friendly arm to check us  or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss  we plunge  and are destroyed.
The Imp of the Perverse,examine these similar actions as we will  we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the perverse.
The Imp of the Perverse,we perpetrate them because we feel that we should not.
The Imp of the Perverse,beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle  and we might  indeed  deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the arch fiend  were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.
The Imp of the Perverse,i have said thus much  that in some measure i may answer your question that i may explain to you why i am here that i may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters  and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.
The Imp of the Perverse,had i not been thus prolix  you might either have misunderstood me altogether  or  with the rabble  have fancied me mad.
The Imp of the Perverse,as it is  you will easily perceive that i am one of the many uncounted victims of the imp of the perverse.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation.
The Imp of the Perverse,for weeks  for months  i pondered upon the means of the murder.
The Imp of the Perverse,i rejected a thousand schemes  because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection.
The Imp of the Perverse,at length  in reading some french memoirs  i found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to madame pilau  through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea struck my fancy at once.
The Imp of the Perverse,i knew my victim    s habit of reading in bed.
The Imp of the Perverse,i knew  too  that his apartment was narrow and ill ventilated.
The Imp of the Perverse,but i need not vex you with impertinent details.
The Imp of the Perverse,i need not describe the easy artifices by which i substituted  in his bed room candle stand  a wax light of my own making for the one which i there found.
The Imp of the Perverse,the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed  and the coroner    s verdict was  death by the visitation of god.
The Imp of the Perverse,having inherited his estate  all went well with me for years.
The Imp of the Perverse,the idea of detection never once entered my brain.
The Imp of the Perverse,of the remains of the fatal taper i had myself carefully disposed.
The Imp of the Perverse,i had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict  or even to suspect me of the crime.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as i reflected upon my absolute security.
The Imp of the Perverse,for a very long period of time i was accustomed to revel in this sentiment.
The Imp of the Perverse,it afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin.
The Imp of the Perverse,but there arrived at length an epoch  from which the pleasurable feeling grew  by scarcely perceptible gradations  into a haunting and harassing thought.
The Imp of the Perverse,it harassed because it haunted.
The Imp of the Perverse,i could scarcely get rid of it for an instant.
The Imp of the Perverse,it is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears  or rather in our memories  of the burthen of some ordinary song  or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.
The Imp of the Perverse,nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good  or the opera air meritorious.
The Imp of the Perverse,in this manner  at last  i would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security  and repeating  in a low undertone  the phrase   i am safe.
The Imp of the Perverse,one day  whilst sauntering along the streets  i arrested myself in the act of murmuring  half aloud  these customary syllables.
The Imp of the Perverse,in a fit of petulance  i remodelled them thus   i am safe i am safe yes if i be not fool enough to make open confession    no sooner had i spoken these words  than i felt an icy chill creep to my heart.
The Imp of the Perverse,i had had some experience in these fits of perversity  whose nature i have been at some trouble to explain   and i remembered well that in no instance i had successfully resisted their attacks.
The Imp of the Perverse,and now my own casual self suggestion that i might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which i had been guilty  confronted me  as if the very ghost of him whom i had murdered and beckoned me on to death.
The Imp of the Perverse,at first  i made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.
The Imp of the Perverse,i walked vigorously faster still faster at length i ran.
The Imp of the Perverse,i felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.
The Imp of the Perverse,every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror  for  alas  i well  too well understood that to think  in my situation  was to be lost.
The Imp of the Perverse,i still quickened my pace.
The Imp of the Perverse,i bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.
The Imp of the Perverse,at length  the populace took the alarm  and pursued me.
The Imp of the Perverse,i felt then the consummation of my fate.
The Imp of the Perverse,could i have torn out my tongue  i would have done it  but a rough voice resounded in my ears a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder.
The Imp of the Perverse,i turned i gasped for breath.
The Imp of the Perverse,for a moment i experienced all the pangs of suffocation  i became blind  and deaf  and giddy  and then some invisible fiend  i thought  struck me with his broad palm upon the back.
The Imp of the Perverse,the long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.
The Imp of the Perverse,they say that i spoke with a distinct enunciation  but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry  as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.
The Imp of the Perverse,having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction  i fell prostrate in a swoon.
The Imp of the Perverse,but why shall i say more  to day i wear these chains  and am here  to morrow i shall be fetterless  but where
The Purloined Letter, at paris  just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of      i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum  in company with my friend c. auguste dupin  in his little back library  or book closet  au troisi  me  no.
The Purloined Letter,rue dun  t  faubourg st. germain.
The Purloined Letter,for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence  while each  to any casual observer  might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.
The Purloined Letter,for myself  however  i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening  i mean the affair of the rue morgue  and the mystery attending the murder of marie rog  t. i looked upon it  therefore  as something of a coincidence  when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance  monsieur g    the prefect of the parisian police.
The Purloined Letter,we gave him a hearty welcome  for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man  and we had not seen him for several years.
The Purloined Letter,we had been sitting in the dark  and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp  but sat down again  without doing so  upon g.    s saying that he had called to consult us  or rather to ask the opinion of my friend  about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.
The Purloined Letter,if it is any point requiring reflection   observed dupin  as he forebore to enkindle the wick   we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.
The Purloined Letter,that is another of your odd notions   said the prefect  who had a fashion of calling every thing  odd  that was beyond his comprehension  and thus lived amid an absolute legion of  oddities.
The Purloined Letter,very true   said dupin  as he supplied his visitor with a pipe  and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.
The Purloined Letter,and what is the difficulty now   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,nothing more in the assassination way  i hope     oh no  nothing of that nature.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  the business is very simple indeed  and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves  but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it  because it is so excessively odd.
The Purloined Letter,simple and odd   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,why  yes  and not exactly that  either.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple  and yet baffles us altogether.
The Purloined Letter,perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault   said my friend.
The Purloined Letter,what nonsense you do talk   replied the prefect  laughing heartily.
The Purloined Letter,perhaps the mystery is a little too plain   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,oh  good heavens  who ever heard of such an idea     a little too self evident.
The Purloined Letter,ha  ha  ha ha  ha  ha  ho  ho  ho   roared our visitor  profoundly amused   oh  dupin  you will be the death of me yet     and what  after all  is the matter on hand   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,why  i will tell you   replied the prefect  as he gave a long  steady and contemplative puff  and settled himself in his chair.
The Purloined Letter,i will tell you in a few words  but  before i begin  let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy  and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold  were it known that i confided it to any one.
The Purloined Letter,proceed   said i.
The Purloined Letter,or not   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,well  then  i have received personal information  from a very high quarter  that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments.
The Purloined Letter,the individual who purloined it is known  this beyond a doubt  he was seen to take it.
The Purloined Letter,it is known  also  that it still remains in his possession.
The Purloined Letter,how is this known   asked dupin.
The Purloined Letter,it is clearly inferred   replied the prefect   from the nature of the document  and from the non appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber    s possession  that is to say  from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.
The Purloined Letter,be a little more explicit   i said.
The Purloined Letter,well  i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.
The Purloined Letter,the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
The Purloined Letter,still i do not quite understand   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,no  well  the disclosure of the document to a third person  who shall be nameless  would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station  and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.
The Purloined Letter,but this ascendancy   i interposed   would depend upon the robber    s knowledge of the loser    s knowledge of the robber.
The Purloined Letter,who would dare     the thief   said g.   is the minister d    who dares all things  those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.
The Purloined Letter,the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.
The Purloined Letter,the document in question a letter  to be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.
The Purloined Letter,during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.
The Purloined Letter,after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer  she was forced to place it  open as it was  upon a table.
The Purloined Letter,the address  however  was uppermost  and  the contents thus unexposed  the letter escaped notice.
The Purloined Letter,at this juncture enters the minister d  .
The Purloined Letter,his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper  recognises the handwriting of the address  observes the confusion of the personage addressed  and fathoms her secret.
The Purloined Letter,after some business transactions  hurried through in his ordinary manner  he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question  opens it  pretends to read it  and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.
The Purloined Letter,again he converses  for some fifteen minutes  upon the public affairs.
The Purloined Letter,at length  in taking leave  he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.
The Purloined Letter,its rightful owner saw  but  of course  dared not call attention to the act  in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.
The Purloined Letter,the minister decamped  leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table.
The Purloined Letter,here  then   said dupin to me   you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete the robber    s knowledge of the loser    s knowledge of the robber.
The Purloined Letter,yes   replied the prefect   and the power thus attained has  for some months past  been wielded  for political purposes  to a very dangerous extent.
The Purloined Letter,the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced  every day  of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.
The Purloined Letter,but this  of course  cannot be done openly.
The Purloined Letter,in fine  driven to despair  she has committed the matter to me.
The Purloined Letter,than whom   said dupin  amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke   no more sagacious agent could  i suppose  be desired  or even imagined.
The Purloined Letter,you flatter me   replied the prefect   but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.
The Purloined Letter,it is clear   said i   as you observe  that the letter is still in possession of the minister  since it is this possession  and not any employment of the letter  which bestows the power.
The Purloined Letter,with the employment the power departs.
The Purloined Letter,true   said g.   and upon this conviction i proceeded.
The Purloined Letter,my first care was to make thorough search of the minister    s hotel  and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
The Purloined Letter,beyond all things  i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.
The Purloined Letter,but   said i   you are quite au fait in these investigations.
The Purloined Letter,the parisian police have done this thing often before.
The Purloined Letter,oh  yes  and for this reason i did not despair.
The Purloined Letter,the habits of the minister gave me  too  a great advantage.
The Purloined Letter,he is frequently absent from home all night.
The Purloined Letter,his servants are by no means numerous.
The Purloined Letter,they sleep at a distance from their master    s apartment  and  being chiefly neapolitans  are readily made drunk.
The Purloined Letter,i have keys  as you know  with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris.
The Purloined Letter,for three months a night has not passed  during the greater part of which i have not been engaged  personally  in ransacking the d   hotel.
The Purloined Letter,my honor is interested  and  to mention a great secret  the reward is enormous.
The Purloined Letter,so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.
The Purloined Letter,i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.
The Purloined Letter,but is it not possible   i suggested   that although the letter may be in possession of the minister  as it unquestionably is  he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises     this is barely possible   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the present peculiar condition of affairs at court  and especially of those intrigues in which d   is known to be involved  would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moment    s notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.
The Purloined Letter,its susceptibility of being produced   said i.
The Purloined Letter,that is to say  of being destroyed   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,true   i observed   the paper is clearly then upon the premises.
The Purloined Letter,as for its being upon the person of the minister  we may consider that as out of the question.
The Purloined Letter,entirely   said the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,he has been twice waylaid  as if by footpads  and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.
The Purloined Letter,you might have spared yourself this trouble   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,d    i presume  is not altogether a fool  and  if not  must have anticipated these waylayings  as a matter of course.
The Purloined Letter,not altogether a fool   said g.   but then he    s a poet  which i take to be only one remove from a fool.
The Purloined Letter,true   said dupin  after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum   although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.
The Purloined Letter,suppose you detail   said i   the particulars of your search.
The Purloined Letter,why the fact is  we took our time  and we searched everywhere.
The Purloined Letter,i have had long experience in these affairs.
The Purloined Letter,i took the entire building  room by room  devoting the nights of a whole week to each.
The Purloined Letter,we examined  first  the furniture of each apartment.
The Purloined Letter,we opened every possible drawer  and i presume you know that  to a properly trained police agent  such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible.
The Purloined Letter,any man is a dolt who permits a     secret     drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.
The Purloined Letter,the thing is so plain.
The Purloined Letter,there is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet.
The Purloined Letter,then we have accurate rules.
The Purloined Letter,the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.
The Purloined Letter,after the cabinets we took the chairs.
The Purloined Letter,the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.
The Purloined Letter,from the tables we removed the tops.
The Purloined Letter,why so     sometimes the top of a table  or other similarly arranged piece of furniture  is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article  then the leg is excavated  the article deposited within the cavity  and the top replaced.
The Purloined Letter,the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.
The Purloined Letter,but could not the cavity be detected by sounding   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,by no means  if  when the article is deposited  a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it.
The Purloined Letter,besides  in our case  we were obliged to proceed without noise.
The Purloined Letter,but you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention.
The Purloined Letter,a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll  not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting needle  and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair  for example.
The Purloined Letter,you did not take to pieces all the chairs     certainly not  but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel  and  indeed the jointings of every description of furniture  by the aid of a most powerful microscope.
The Purloined Letter,had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.
The Purloined Letter,a single grain of gimlet dust  for example  would have been as obvious as an apple.
The Purloined Letter,any disorder in the glueing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection.
The Purloined Letter,i presume you looked to the mirrors  between the boards and the plates  and you probed the beds and the bed clothes  as well as the curtains and carpets.
The Purloined Letter,that of course  and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way  then we examined the house itself.
The Purloined Letter,we divided its entire surface into compartments  which we numbered  so that none might be missed  then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises  including the two houses immediately adjoining  with the microscope  as before.
The Purloined Letter,the two houses adjoining   i exclaimed   you must have had a great deal of trouble.
The Purloined Letter,we had  but the reward offered is prodigious     you include the grounds about the houses     all the grounds are paved with brick.
The Purloined Letter,they gave us comparatively little trouble.
The Purloined Letter,we examined the moss between the bricks  and found it undisturbed.
The Purloined Letter,you looked among d      s papers  of course  and into the books of the library     certainly  we opened every package and parcel  we not only opened every book  but we turned over every leaf in each volume  not contenting ourselves with a mere shake  according to the fashion of some of our police officers.
The Purloined Letter,we also measured the thickness of every book cover  with the most accurate admeasurement  and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.
The Purloined Letter,had any of the bindings been recently meddled with  it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.
The Purloined Letter,some five or six volumes  just from the hands of the binder  we carefully probed  longitudinally  with the needles.
The Purloined Letter,you explored the floors beneath the carpets     beyond doubt.
The Purloined Letter,we removed every carpet  and examined the boards with the microscope.
The Purloined Letter,and the paper on the walls     yes.
The Purloined Letter,you looked into the cellars     we did.
The Purloined Letter,then   i said   you have been making a miscalculation  and the letter is not upon the premises  as you suppose.
The Purloined Letter,i fear you are right there   said the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,and now  dupin  what would you advise me to do     to make a thorough re search of the premises.
The Purloined Letter,that is absolutely needless   replied g  .
The Purloined Letter,i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel.
The Purloined Letter,i have no better advice to give you   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,you have  of course  an accurate description of the letter     oh yes   and here the prefect  producing a memorandum book  proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal  and especially of the external appearance of the missing document.
The Purloined Letter,soon after finishing the perusal of this description  he took his departure  more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before.
The Purloined Letter,in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit  and found us occupied very nearly as before.
The Purloined Letter,he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation.
The Purloined Letter,at length i said     well  but g    what of the purloined letter  i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister     confound him  say i yes  i made the re examination  however  as dupin suggested but it was all labor lost  as i knew it would be.
The Purloined Letter,how much was the reward offered  did you say   asked dupin.
The Purloined Letter,why  a very great deal a very liberal reward i don    t like to say how much  precisely  but one thing i will say  that i wouldn    t mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter.
The Purloined Letter,the fact is  it is becoming of more and more importance every day  and the reward has been lately doubled.
The Purloined Letter,if it were trebled  however  i could do no more than i have done.
The Purloined Letter,why  yes   said dupin  drawlingly  between the whiffs of his meerschaum   i really think  g    you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter.
The Purloined Letter,you might do a little more  i think  eh     how  in what way     why puff  puff you might puff  puff employ counsel in the matter  eh  puff  puff  puff.
The Purloined Letter,do you remember the story they tell of abernethy     no  hang abernethy     to be sure  hang him and welcome.
The Purloined Letter,but  once upon a time  a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion.
The Purloined Letter,getting up  for this purpose  an ordinary conversation in a private company  he insinuated his case to the physician  as that of an imaginary individual.
The Purloined Letter,we will suppose      said the miser      that his symptoms are such and such  now  doctor  what would you have directed him to take            take      said abernethy      why  take advice  to be sure.
The Purloined Letter,but   said the prefect  a little discomposed   i am perfectly willing to take advice  and to pay for it.
The Purloined Letter,i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.
The Purloined Letter,in that case   replied dupin  opening a drawer  and producing a check book   you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.
The Purloined Letter,when you have signed it  i will hand you the letter.
The Purloined Letter,i was astounded.
The Purloined Letter,the prefect appeared absolutely thunder stricken.
The Purloined Letter,for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless  looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth  and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets  then  apparently recovering himself in some measure  he seized a pen  and after several pauses and vacant stares  finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs  and handed it across the table to dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket book  then  unlocking an escritoire  took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,this functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy  opened it with a trembling hand  cast a rapid glance at its contents  and then  scrambling and struggling to the door  rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house  without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check.
The Purloined Letter,when he had gone  my friend entered into some explanations.
The Purloined Letter,the parisian police   he said   are exceedingly able in their way.
The Purloined Letter,they are persevering  ingenious  cunning  and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand.
The Purloined Letter,thus  when g   detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d    i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation so far as his labors extended.
The Purloined Letter,so far as his labors extended   said i.
The Purloined Letter,yes   said dupin.
The Purloined Letter,the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind  but carried out to absolute perfection.
The Purloined Letter,had the letter been deposited within the range of their search  these fellows would  beyond a question  have found it.
The Purloined Letter,i merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.
The Purloined Letter,the measures  then   he continued   were good in their kind  and well executed  their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case  and to the man.
The Purloined Letter,a certain set of highly ingenious resources are  with the prefect  a sort of procrustean bed  to which he forcibly adapts his designs.
The Purloined Letter,but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand  and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.
The Purloined Letter,i knew one about eight years of age  whose success at guessing in the game of     even and odd     attracted universal admiration.
The Purloined Letter,this game is simple  and is played with marbles.
The Purloined Letter,one player holds in his hand a number of these toys  and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.
The Purloined Letter,if the guess is right  the guesser wins one  if wrong  he loses one.
The Purloined Letter,the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school.
The Purloined Letter,of course he had some principle of guessing  and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents.
The Purloined Letter,for example  an arrant simpleton is his opponent  and  holding up his closed hand  asks      are they even or odd      our schoolboy replies      odd      and loses  but upon the second trial he wins  for he then says to himself      the simpleton had them even upon the first trial  and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second  i will therefore guess odd      he guesses odd  and wins.
The Purloined Letter,now  with a simpleton a degree above the first  he would have reasoned thus      this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd  and  in the second  he will propose to himself  upon the first impulse  a simple variation from even to odd  as did the first simpleton  but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation  and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before.
The Purloined Letter,i will therefore guess even      he guesses even  and wins.
The Purloined Letter,now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy  whom his fellows termed     lucky      what  in its last analysis  is it     it is merely   i said   an identification of the reasoner    s intellect with that of his opponent.
The Purloined Letter,it is   said dupin   and  upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted  i received answer as follows      when i wish to find out how wise  or how stupid  or how good  or how wicked is any one  or what are his thoughts at the moment  i fashion the expression of my face  as accurately as possible  in accordance with the expression of his  and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart  as if to match or correspond with the expression.
The Purloined Letter,this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucault  to la bougive  to machiavelli  and to campanella.
The Purloined Letter,and the identification   i said   of the reasoner    s intellect with that of his opponent  depends  if i understand you aright  upon the accuracy with which the opponent    s intellect is admeasured.
The Purloined Letter,for its practical value it depends upon this   replied dupin   and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently  first  by default of this identification  and  secondly  by ill admeasurement  or rather through non admeasurement  of the intellect with which they are engaged.
The Purloined Letter,they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity  and  in searching for anything hidden  advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it.
The Purloined Letter,they are right in this much that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass  but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own  the felon foils them  of course.
The Purloined Letter,this always happens when it is above their own  and very usually when it is below.
The Purloined Letter,they have no variation of principle in their investigations  at best  when urged by some unusual emergency by some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice  without touching their principles.
The Purloined Letter,what  for example  in this case of d    has been done to vary the principle of action  what is all this boring  and probing  and sounding  and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search  which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity  to which the prefect  in the long routine of his duty  has been accustomed  do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter  not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg but  at least  in some out of the way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg  and do you not see also  that such recherch  s nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions  and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects  for  in all cases of concealment  a disposal of the article concealed a disposal of it in this recherch   manner  is  in the very first instance  presumable and presumed  and thus its discovery depends  not at all upon the acumen  but altogether upon the mere care  patience  and determination of the seekers  and where the case is of importance or  what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes  when the reward is of magnitude  the qualities in question have never been known to fail.
The Purloined Letter,you will now understand what i meant in suggesting that  had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefect    s examination in other words  had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.
The Purloined Letter,this functionary  however  has been thoroughly mystified  and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool  because he has acquired renown as a poet.
The Purloined Letter,all fools are poets  this the prefect feels  and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.
The Purloined Letter,but is this really the poet   i asked.
The Purloined Letter,there are two brothers  i know  and both have attained reputation in letters.
The Purloined Letter,the minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus.
The Purloined Letter,he is a mathematician  and no poet.
The Purloined Letter,you are mistaken  i know him well  he is both.
The Purloined Letter,as poet and mathematician  he would reason well  as mere mathematician  he could not have reasoned at all  and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,you surprise me   i said   by these opinions  which have been contradicted by the voice of the world.
The Purloined Letter,you do not mean to set at naught the well digested idea of centuries.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.
The Purloined Letter,il y a    pari  r       replied dupin  quoting from chamfort       que toute id  e publique  toute convention re  ue est une sottise  car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematicians  i grant you  have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude  and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth.
The Purloined Letter,with an art worthy a better cause  for example  they have insinuated the term     analysis     into application to algebra.
The Purloined Letter,the french are the originators of this particular deception  but if a term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then     analysis     conveys     algebra     about as much as  in latin      ambitus     implies     ambition          religio         religion      or     homines honesti     a set of honorable men.
The Purloined Letter,you have a quarrel on hand  i see   said i   with some of the algebraists of paris  but proceed.
The Purloined Letter,i dispute the availability  and thus the value  of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.
The Purloined Letter,i dispute  in particular  the reason educed by mathematical study.
The Purloined Letter,the mathematics are the science of form and quantity  mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity.
The Purloined Letter,the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra  are abstract or general truths.
The Purloined Letter,and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.
The Purloined Letter,mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.
The Purloined Letter,what is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals  for example.
The Purloined Letter,in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole.
The Purloined Letter,in chemistry also the axiom fails.
The Purloined Letter,in the consideration of motive it fails  for two motives  each of a given value  have not  necessarily  a value when united  equal to the sum of their values apart.
The Purloined Letter,there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation.
The Purloined Letter,but the mathematician argues  from his finite truths  through habit  as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be.
The Purloined Letter,bryant  in his very learned     mythology      mentions an analogous source of error  when he says that     although the pagan fables are not believed  yet we forget ourselves continually  and make inferences from them as existing realities.
The Purloined Letter,with the algebraists  however  who are pagans themselves  the     pagan fables     are believed  and the inferences are made  not so much through lapse of memory  as through an unaccountable addling of the brains.
The Purloined Letter,in short  i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots  or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x  px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q.
The Purloined Letter,say to one of these gentlemen  by way of experiment  if you please  that you believe occasions may occur where x  px is not altogether equal to q  and  having made him understand what you mean  get out of his reach as speedily as convenient  for  beyond doubt  he will endeavor to knock you down.
The Purloined Letter,i mean to say   continued dupin  while i merely laughed at his last observations   that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician  the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check.
The Purloined Letter,i know him  however  as both mathematician and poet  and my measures were adapted to his capacity  with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded.
The Purloined Letter,i knew him as a courtier  too  and as a bold intriguant.
The Purloined Letter,such a man  i considered  could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action.
The Purloined Letter,he could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected.
The Purloined Letter,he must have foreseen  i reflected  the secret investigations of his premises.
The Purloined Letter,his frequent absences from home at night  which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success  i regarded only as ruses  to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police  and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g    in fact  did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises.
The Purloined Letter,i felt  also  that the whole train of thought  which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now  concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister.
The Purloined Letter,it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment.
The Purloined Letter,he could not  i reflected  be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes  to the probes  to the gimlets  and to the microscopes of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,i saw  in fine  that he would be driven  as a matter of course  to simplicity  if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.
The Purloined Letter,you will remember  perhaps  how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested  upon our first interview  that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self evident.
The Purloined Letter,yes   said i   i remember his merriment well.
The Purloined Letter,i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.
The Purloined Letter,the material world   continued dupin   abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial  and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma  that metaphor  or simile  may be made to strengthen an argument  as well as to embellish a description.
The Purloined Letter,the principle of the vis inerti    for example  seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.
The Purloined Letter,it is not more true in the former  that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one  and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty  than it is  in the latter  that intellects of the vaster capacity  while more forcible  more constant  and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade  are yet the less readily moved  and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.
The Purloined Letter,again  have you ever noticed which of the street signs  over the shop doors  are the most attractive of attention     i have never given the matter a thought   i said.
The Purloined Letter,there is a game of puzzles   he resumed   which is played upon a map.
The Purloined Letter,one party playing requires another to find a given word the name of town  river  state or empire any word  in short  upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.
The Purloined Letter,a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names  but the adept selects such words as stretch  in large characters  from one end of the chart to the other.
The Purloined Letter,these  like the over largely lettered signs and placards of the street  escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious  and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self evident.
The Purloined Letter,but this is a point  it appears  somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect.
The Purloined Letter,he never once thought it probable  or possible  that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world  by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.
The Purloined Letter,but the more i reflected upon the daring  dashing  and discriminating ingenuity of d    upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand  if he intended to use it to good purpose  and upon the decisive evidence  obtained by the prefect  that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary    s ordinary search the more satisfied i became that  to conceal this letter  the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.
The Purloined Letter,full of these ideas  i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles  and called one fine morning  quite by accident  at the ministerial hotel.
The Purloined Letter,i found d   at home  yawning  lounging  and dawdling  as usual  and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui.
The Purloined Letter,he is  perhaps  the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when nobody sees him.
The Purloined Letter,to be even with him  i complained of my weak eyes  and lamented the necessity of the spectacles  under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment  while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.
The Purloined Letter,i paid especial attention to a large writing table near which he sat  and upon which lay confusedly  some miscellaneous letters and other papers  with one or two musical instruments and a few books.
The Purloined Letter,here  however  after a long and very deliberate scrutiny  i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.
The Purloined Letter,at length my eyes  in going the circuit of the room  fell upon a trumpery fillagree card rack of pasteboard  that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon  from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel piece.
The Purloined Letter,in this rack  which had three or four compartments  were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter.
The Purloined Letter,this last was much soiled and crumpled.
The Purloined Letter,it was torn nearly in two  across the middle as if a design  in the first instance  to tear it entirely up as worthless  had been altered  or stayed  in the second.
The Purloined Letter,it had a large black seal  bearing the d   cipher very conspicuously  and was addressed  in a diminutive female hand  to d    the minister  himself.
The Purloined Letter,it was thrust carelessly  and even  as it seemed  contemptuously  into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.
The Purloined Letter,no sooner had i glanced at this letter  than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search.
The Purloined Letter,to be sure  it was  to all appearance  radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description.
The Purloined Letter,here the seal was large and black  with the d   cipher  there it was small and red  with the ducal arms of the s   family.
The Purloined Letter,here  the address  to the minister  diminutive and feminine  there the superscription  to a certain royal personage  was markedly bold and decided  the size alone formed a point of correspondence.
The Purloined Letter,but  then  the radicalness of these differences  which was excessive  the dirt  the soiled and torn condition of the paper  so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d    and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things  together with the hyper obtrusive situation of this document  full in the view of every visitor  and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived  these things  i say  were strongly corroborative of suspicion  in one who came with the intention to suspect.
The Purloined Letter,i protracted my visit as long as possible  and  while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him  i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter.
The Purloined Letter,in this examination  i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack  and also fell  at length  upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained.
The Purloined Letter,in scrutinizing the edges of the paper  i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary.
The Purloined Letter,they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper  having been once folded and pressed with a folder  is refolded in a reversed direction  in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold.
The Purloined Letter,this discovery was sufficient.
The Purloined Letter,it was clear to me that the letter had been turned  as a glove  inside out  re directed  and re sealed.
The Purloined Letter,i bade the minister good morning  and took my departure at once  leaving a gold snuff box upon the table.
The Purloined Letter,the next morning i called for the snuff box  when we resumed  quite eagerly  the conversation of the preceding day.
The Purloined Letter,while thus engaged  however  a loud report  as if of a pistol  was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel  and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams  and the shoutings of a terrified mob.
The Purloined Letter,d   rushed to a casement  threw it open  and looked out.
The Purloined Letter,in the meantime  i stepped to the card rack  took the letter  put it in my pocket  and replaced it by a fac simile   so far as regards externals   which i had carefully prepared at my lodgings imitating the d   cipher  very readily  by means of a seal formed of bread.
The Purloined Letter,the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket.
The Purloined Letter,he had fired it among a crowd of women and children.
The Purloined Letter,it proved  however  to have been without ball  and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard.
The Purloined Letter,when he had gone  d   came from the window  whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.
The Purloined Letter,soon afterwards i bade him farewell.
The Purloined Letter,the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.
The Purloined Letter,but what purpose had you   i asked   in replacing the letter by a fac simile  would it not have been better  at the first visit  to have seized it openly  and departed     d     replied dupin   is a desperate man  and a man of nerve.
The Purloined Letter,his hotel  too  is not without attendants devoted to his interests.
The Purloined Letter,had i made the wild attempt you suggest  i might never have left the ministerial presence alive.
The Purloined Letter,the good people of paris might have heard of me no more.
The Purloined Letter,but i had an object apart from these considerations.
The Purloined Letter,you know my political prepossessions.
The Purloined Letter,in this matter  i act as a partisan of the lady concerned.
The Purloined Letter,for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power.
The Purloined Letter,she has now him in hers since  being unaware that the letter is not in his possession  he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.
The Purloined Letter,thus will he inevitably commit himself  at once  to his political destruction.
The Purloined Letter,his downfall  too  will not be more precipitate than awkward.
The Purloined Letter,it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni  but in all kinds of climbing  as catalani said of singing  it is far more easy to get up than to come down.
The Purloined Letter,in the present instance i have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends.
The Purloined Letter,he is that monstrum horrendum  an unprincipled man of genius.
The Purloined Letter,i confess  however  that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts  when  being defied by her whom the prefect terms     a certain personage     he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the card rack.
The Purloined Letter,how  did you put any thing particular in it     why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting.
The Purloined Letter,d    at vienna once  did me an evil turn  which i told him  quite good humoredly  that i should remember.
The Purloined Letter,so  as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him  i thought it a pity not to give him a clue.
The Purloined Letter,he is well acquainted with my ms.  and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade, having had occasion  lately  in the course of some oriental investigations  to consult the tellmenow isits  ornot  a work which  like the zohar of simeon jochaides  is scarcely known at all  even in europe  and which has never been quoted  to my knowledge  by any american if we except  perhaps  the author of the  curiosities of american literature   having had occasion  i say  to turn over some pages of the first mentioned very remarkable work  i was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier    s daughter  scheherazade  as that fate is depicted in the  arabian nights   and that the d  nouement there given  if not altogether inaccurate  as far as it goes  is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,for full information on this interesting topic  i must refer the inquisitive reader to the  isits  ornot  itself  but in the meantime  i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it will be remembered  that  in the usual version of the tales  a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen  not only puts her to death  but makes a vow  by his beard and the prophet  to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions  and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter  and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense  he was interrupted one afternoon  no doubt at his prayers  by a visit from his grand vizier  to whose daughter  it appears  there had occurred an idea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,her name was scheherazade  and her idea was  that she would either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty  or perish  after the approved fashion of all heroines  in the attempt.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,accordingly  and although we do not find it to be leap year  which makes the sacrifice more meritorious   she deputes her father  the grand vizier  to make an offer to the king of her hand.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this hand the king eagerly accepts  he had intended to take it at all events  and had put off the matter from day to day  only through fear of the vizier   but  in accepting it now  he gives all parties very distinctly to understand  that  grand vizier or no grand vizier  he has not the slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when  therefore  the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king  and did actually marry him despite her father    s excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind when she would and did marry him  i say  will i  nill i  it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it seems  however  that this politic damsel  who had been reading machiavelli  beyond doubt   had a very ingenious little plot in her mind.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,on the night of the wedding  she contrived  upon i forget what specious pretence  to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed  and  a little before cock crowing  she took care to awaken the good monarch  her husband  who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow   she managed to awaken him  i say   although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion  he slept well  by the profound interest of a story  about a rat and a black cat  i think  which she was narrating  all in an undertone  of course  to her sister.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the day broke  it so happened that this history was not altogether finished  and that scheherazade  in the nature of things could not finish it just then  since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung a thing very little more pleasant than hanging  only a trifle more genteel   the king    s curiosity  however  prevailing  i am sorry to say  even over his sound religious principles  induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning  for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat  a black cat  i think it was  and the rat.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the night having arrived  however  the lady scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat  the rat was blue  but before she well knew what she was about  found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration  having reference  if i am not altogether mistaken  to a pink horse  with green wings  that went  in a violent manner  by clockwork  and was wound up with an indigo key.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other and  as the day broke before its conclusion  notwithstanding all the queen    s endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing   there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before  for twenty four hours.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result  and then the next and then again the next  so that  in the end  the good monarch  having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights  either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time  or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way  or  what is more probable  breaks it outright  as well as the head of his father confessor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at all events  scheherazade  who  being lineally descended from eve  fell heir  perhaps  to the whole seven baskets of talk  which the latter lady  we all know  picked up from under the trees in the garden of eden  scheherazade  i say  finally triumphed  and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,now  this conclusion  which is that of the story as we have it upon record  is  no doubt  excessively proper and pleasant but alas  like a great many pleasant things  is more pleasant than true  and i am indebted altogether to the  isits  ornot  for the means of correcting the error.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,le mieux   says a french proverb   est l    ennemi du bien   and  in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk  i should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to seventy seven.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,my dear sister   said she  on the thousand and second night   i quote the language of the  isits  ornot  at this point  verbatim   my dear sister   said she   now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has blown over  and that this odious tax is so happily repealed  i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king  who i am sorry to say  snores a thing no gentleman would do  the full conclusion of sinbad the sailor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which i related  but the truth is  i felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration  and so was seduced into cutting them short a grievous piece of misconduct  for which i only trust that allah will forgive me.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect and as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise  i will forthwith entertain you  and him if he pleases  with the sequel of this very remarkable story.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hereupon the sister of scheherazade  as i have it from the  isits  ornot   expressed no very particular intensity of gratification  but the king  having been sufficiently pinched  at length ceased snoring  and finally said   hum   and then  hoo   when the queen  understanding these words  which are no doubt arabic  to signify that he was all attention  and would do his best not to snore any more the queen  i say  having arranged these matters to her satisfaction  re entered thus  at once  into the history of sinbad the sailor        at length  in my old age       these are the words of sinbad himself  as retailed by scheherazade      at length  in my old age  and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home  i became once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries  and one day  without acquainting any of my family with my design  i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky  and  engaging a porter to carry them  went with him down to the sea shore  to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explored.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having deposited the packages upon the sands  we sat down beneath some trees  and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship  but during several hours we saw none whatever.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound  and the porter  after listening awhile  declared that he also could distinguish it.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,presently it grew louder  and then still louder  so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,at length  on the edge of the horizon  we discovered a black speck  which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster  swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it came toward us with inconceivable swiftness  throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast  and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed  with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow  and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace  o most sublime and munificent of the caliphs.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its body  which was unlike that of ordinary fishes  was as solid as a rock  and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water  with the exception of a narrow blood red streak that completely begirdled it.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the belly  which floated beneath the surface  and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows  was entirely covered with metallic scales  of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the back was flat and nearly white  and from it there extended upwards of six spines  about half the length of the whole body.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive  but  as if to make up for this deficiency  it was provided with at least four score of eyes  that protruded from their sockets like those of the green dragon fly  and were arranged all around the body in two rows  one above the other  and parallel to the blood red streak  which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others  and had the appearance of solid gold.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,although this beast approached us  as i have before said  with the greatest rapidity  it must have been moved altogether by necromancy for it had neither fins like a fish nor web feet like a duck  nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel  nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike  only  not far from the latter  were two small holes that served for nostrils  and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence  and with a shrieking  disagreeable noise.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great  but it was even surpassed by our astonishment  when upon getting a nearer look  we perceived upon the creature    s back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men  and altogether much resembling them  except that they wore no garments  as men do   being supplied  by nature  no doubt  with an ugly uncomfortable covering  a good deal like cloth  but fitting so tight to the skin  as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward  and put them apparently to severe pain.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,on the very tips of their heads were certain square looking boxes  which  at first sight  i thought might have been intended to answer as turbans  but i soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid  and i therefore concluded they were contrivances designed  by their great weight  to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars   badges of servitude  no doubt   such as we keep on our dogs  only much wider and infinitely stiffer  so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time  and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful  if not positively in an awful degree.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood  it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent  and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire  accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke  and a noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,as the smoke cleared away  we saw one of the odd man animals standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand  through which  putting it to his mouth  he presently addressed us in loud  harsh  and disagreeable accents  that  perhaps  we should have mistaken for language  had they not come altogether through the nose.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,being thus evidently spoken to  i was at a loss how to reply  as i could in no manner understand what was said  and in this difficulty i turned to the porter  who was near swooning through affright  and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was  what it wanted  and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,to this the porter replied  as well as he could for trepidation  that he had once before heard of this sea beast  that it was a cruel demon  with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire  created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind  that the things upon its back were vermin  such as sometimes infest cats and dogs  only a little larger and more savage  and that these vermin had their uses  however evil for  through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings  it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill  and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this account determined me to take to my heels  and  without once even looking behind me  i ran at full speed up into the hills  while the porter ran equally fast  although nearly in an opposite direction  so that  by these means  he finally made his escape with my bundles  of which i have no doubt he took excellent care although this is a point i cannot determine  as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,for myself  i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men vermin  who had come to the shore in boats  that i was very soon overtaken  bound hand and foot  and conveyed to the beast  which immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this  but regret being useless  i made the best of my condition  and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the man animal that owned the trumpet  and who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i succeeded so well in this endeavor that  in a few days  the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor  and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language  so that  at length  i was enabled to converse with it readily  and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,washish squashish squeak  sinbad  hey diddle diddle  grunt unt grumble  hiss  fiss  whiss      said he to me  one day after dinner but i beg a thousand pardons  i had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the cock neighs  so the man animals were called  i presume because their language formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of the rooster .
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,with your permission  i will translate.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,washish squashish      and so forth  that is to say      i am happy to find  my dear sinbad  that you are really a very excellent fellow  we are now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the globe  and since you are so desirous of seeing the world  i will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the beast.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far  relates the  isits  ornot   the king turned over from his left side to his right  and said    it is  in fact  very surprising  my dear queen  that you omitted  hitherto  these latter adventures of sinbad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange    the king having thus expressed himself  we are told  the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the following words    sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative     i thanked the man animal for its kindness  and soon found myself very much at home on the beast  which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean  although the surface of the latter is  in that part of the world  by no means flat  but round like a pomegranate  so that we went so to say either up hill or down hill all the time.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,that i think  was very singular   interrupted the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,nevertheless  it is quite true   replied scheherazade.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i have my doubts   rejoined the king   but  pray  be so good as to go on with the story.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i will   said the queen.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the beast      continued sinbad to the caliph      swam  as i have related  up hill and down hill until  at length  we arrived at an island  many hundreds of miles in circumference  but which  nevertheless  had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,leaving this island      said sinbad  for scheherazade  it must be understood  took no notice of her husband    s ill mannered ejaculation      leaving this island  we came to another where the forests were of solid stone  and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king  again  but scheherazade  paying him no attention  continued in the language of sinbad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,passing beyond this last island  we reached a country where there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth  and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,from the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads of gems  like diamonds  but larger than men  and in among the streets of towers and pyramids and temples  there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony  and swarming with fish that had no eyes.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty mountain  down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal  some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long       while from an abyss on the summit  issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens  and it became darker than the darkest midnight  so that when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain  it was impossible to see the whitest object  however close we held it to our eyes.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hum   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,after quitting this coast  the beast continued his voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed for we here saw a great lake  at the bottom of which  more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water  there flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,hoo   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel  just as our own does feather.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,fiddle de dee   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,proceeding still in the same direction  we presently arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole world.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,through it there meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this river was of unspeakable depth  and of a transparency richer than that of amber.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it was from three to six miles in width  and its banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height  were crowned with ever blossoming trees and perpetual sweet scented flowers  that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden  but the name of this luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror  and to enter it was inevitable death.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,humph   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we left this kingdom in great haste  and  after some days  came to another  where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil  of a funnel shape  and line the sides of them with rocks  so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly  when trodden upon by other animals  thus precipitating them into the monster    s dens  where their blood is immediately sucked  and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from  the caverns of death.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,pooh   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,continuing our progress  we perceived a district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,there were others that sprang from the substance of other vegetables        others that derived their substance from the bodies of living animals        and then again  there were others that glowed all over with intense fire        others that moved from place to place at pleasure        and what was still more wonderful  we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs at will and had  moreover  the detestable passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures  and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,pshaw   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,quitting this land  we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition  that they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the empire.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult problems  they were solved upon the spot the one by the bees  and the other by the birds  but the king keeping their solution a secret  it was only after the most profound researches and labor  and the writing of an infinity of big books  during a long series of years  that the men mathematicians at length arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the birds.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,oh my   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close upon another  from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth  and two hundred and forty miles long  so that  although they flew a mile during every minute  it required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us in which there were several millions of millions of fowl.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,oh fy   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,no sooner had we got rid of these birds  which occasioned us great annoyance  than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another kind  and infinitely larger than even the rocs which i met in my former voyages  for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio  oh  most munificent of caliphs.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive  but was fashioned entirely of belly  which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness  of a soft looking substance  smooth  shining and striped with various colors.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,in its talons  the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens  a house from which it had knocked off the roof  and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings  who  beyond doubt  were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we shouted with all our might  in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey  but it merely gave a snort or puff  as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand         stuff   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity  but which  nevertheless  was supported entirely upon the back of a sky blue cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,that  now  i believe   said the king   because i have read something of the kind before  in a book.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,we passed immediately beneath this continent   swimming in between the legs of the cow   and  after some hours  found ourselves in a wonderful country indeed  which  i was informed by the man animal  was his own native land  inhabited by things of his own species.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this elevated the man animal very much in my esteem  and in fact  i now began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him  for i found that the man animals in general were a nation of the most powerful magicians  who lived with worms in their brain        which  no doubt  served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination         nonsense   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,among the magicians  were domesticated several animals of very singular kinds  for example  there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,in place of corn  he had black stones for his usual food  and yet  in spite of so hard a diet  he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest temple in this city  at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,twattle   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,i saw  also  among these people a hen without feathers  but bigger than a camel  instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick  her blood  like that of the horse   to whom  in fact  she was nearly related   was boiling water  and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this hen brought forth very frequently  a hundred chickens in the day  and  after birth  they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of their mother.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,fal lal   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and wood  and leather  and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess  all the race of mankind with the exception of the great caliph  haroun alraschid.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another of these magi constructed  of like material  a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it  for so great were its reasoning powers that  in a second  it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor beast  but which had brains of lead  intermixed with a black matter like pitch  and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour  and this with so exquisite a precision  that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,this thing was of prodigious strength  so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest empires at a breath  but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,ridiculous   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his veins the blood of the salamanders  for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had the faculty of converting the common metals into gold  without even looking at them during the process.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had such quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic body  while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times in a second.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,absurd   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another of these magicians  by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet saw  could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms  kick out their legs  fight  or even get up and dance at his will.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another had so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and indite a letter at bagdad or indeed at any distance whatsoever.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens  and it came at his call  and served him for a plaything when it came.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another made ice in a red hot furnace.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another directed the sun to paint his portrait  and the sun did.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,another took this luminary with the moon and the planets  and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy  probed into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,but the whole nation is  indeed  of so surprising a necromantic ability  that not even their infants  nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all  or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of creation.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,preposterous   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi       continued scheherazade  without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband      the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and refined  and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful  but for an unhappy fatality that besets them  and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has  hitherto  been adequate to save.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,some fatalities come in certain shapes  and some in others but this of which i speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,a what   said the king.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,a crotchet      said scheherazade.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,one of the evil genii  who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill  has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the small of the back.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,perfection of loveliness  they say  is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,having been long possessed of this idea  and bolsters being cheap in that country  the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary         stop   said the king  i can    t stand that  and i won    t. you have already given me a dreadful headache with your lies.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,the day  too  i perceive  is beginning to break.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,how long have we been married  my conscience is getting to be troublesome again.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,and then that dromedary touch do you take me for a fool  upon the whole  you might as well get up and be throttled.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,these words  as i learn from the  isits  ornot   both grieved and astonished scheherazade  but  as she knew the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity  and quite unlikely to forfeit his word  she submitted to her fate with a good grace.
The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Shceherazade,she derived  however  great consolation   during the tightening of the bowstring   from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold  and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward  in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.
A Decent into the Maelstrom, we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,not long ago   said he at length   and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons  but  about three years past  there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of and the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you suppose me a very old man but i am not.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white  to weaken my limbs  and to unstring my nerves  so that i tremble at the least exertion  and am frightened at a shadow.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,do you know i can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy    the  little cliff   upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it  while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge this  little cliff  arose  a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock  some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion  that i fell at full length upon the ground  clung to the shrubs around me  and dared not even glance upward at the sky while i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you must get over these fancies   said the guide   for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentioned and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we are now   he continued  in that particularizing manner which distinguished him  we are now close upon the norwegian coast in the sixty eighth degree of latitude in the great province of nordland and in the dreary district of lofoden.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the mountain upon whose top we sit is helseggen  the cloudy.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,now raise yourself up a little higher hold on to the grass if you feel giddy so and look out  beyond the belt of vapor beneath us  into the sea.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i looked dizzily  and beheld a wide expanse of ocean  whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographer    s account of the mare tenebrarum.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,to the right and left  as far as the eye could reach  there lay outstretched  like ramparts of the world  lines of horridly black and beetling cliff  whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest  howling and shrieking forever.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed  and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea  there was visible a small  bleak looking island  or  more properly  its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,about two miles nearer the land  arose another of smaller size  hideously craggy and barren  and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the appearance of the ocean  in the space between the more distant island and the shore  had something very unusual about it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,although  at the time  so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double reefed trysail  and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight  still there was here nothing like a regular swell  but only a short  quick  angry cross dashing of water in every direction as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the island in the distance   resumed the old man   is called by the norwegians vurrgh.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the one midway is moskoe.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,that a mile to the northward is ambaaren.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,yonder are islesen  hotholm  keildhelm  suarven  and buckholm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,farther off between moskoe and vurrgh are otterholm  flimen  sandflesen  and stockholm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these are the true names of the places but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all  is more than either you or i can understand.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,do you hear anything  do you see any change in the water    we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen  to which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden  so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as the old man spoke  i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound  like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie  and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us  was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,even while i gazed  this current acquired a monstrous velocity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,each moment added to its speed to its headlong impetuosity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in five minutes the whole sea  as far as vurrgh  was lashed into ungovernable fury  but it was between moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,here the vast bed of the waters  seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels  burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion heaving  boiling  hissing gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices  and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in a few minutes more  there came over the scene another radical alteration.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the general surface grew somewhat more smooth  and the whirlpools  one by one  disappeared  while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these streaks  at length  spreading out to a great distance  and entering into combination  took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices  and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,suddenly very suddenly this assumed a distinct and definite existence  in a circle of more than a mile in diameter.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray  but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel  whose interior  as far as the eye could fathom it  was a smooth  shining  and jet black wall of water  inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty five degrees  speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion  and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice  half shriek  half roar  such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the mountain trembled to its very base  and the rock rocked.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i threw myself upon my face  and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this   said i at length  to the old man  this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the maelstr  m.    so it is sometimes termed   said he.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we norwegians call it the moskoe str  m  from the island of moskoe in the midway.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,that of jonas ramus  which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any  cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence  or of the horror of the scene or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it  nor at what time  but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen  nor during a storm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there are some passages of his description  nevertheless  which may be quoted for their details  although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,between lofoden and moskoe   he says   the depth of the water is between thirty six and forty fathoms  but on the other side  toward ver  vurrgh  this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel  without the risk of splitting on the rocks  which happens even in the calmest weather.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when it is flood  the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity  but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts  the noise being heard several leagues off  and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth  that if a ship comes within its attraction  it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom  and there beat to pieces against the rocks  and when the water relaxes  the fragments thereof are thrown up again.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood  and in calm weather  and last but a quarter of an hour  its violence gradually returning.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when the stream is most boisterous  and its fury heightened by a storm  it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,boats  yachts  and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it likewise happens frequently  that whales come too near the stream  and are overpowered by its violence  and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a bear once  attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe  was caught by the stream and borne down  while he roared terribly  so as to be heard on shore.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,large stocks of firs and pine trees  after being absorbed by the current  rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks  among which they are whirled to and fro.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea it being constantly high and low water every six hours.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in the year       early in the morning of sexagesima sunday  it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in regard to the depth of the water  i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the  forty fathoms  must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the depth in the centre of the moskoe str  m must be immeasurably greater  and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of helseggen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below  i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records  as a matter difficult of belief  the anecdotes of the whales and the bears  for it appeared to me  in fact  a self evident thing  that the largest ship of the line in existence  coming within the influence of that deadly attraction  could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane  and must disappear bodily and at once.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the attempts to account for the phenomenon some of which  i remember  seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the idea generally received is that this  as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands   have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling  at flux and reflux  against a ridge of rocks and shelves  which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract  and thus the higher the flood rises  the deeper must the fall be  and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex  the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these are the words of the encyclop  dia britannica.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the maelstr  m is an abyss penetrating the globe  and issuing in some very remote part the gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this opinion  idle in itself  was the one to which  as i gazed  my imagination most readily assented  and  mentioning it to the guide  i was rather surprised to hear him say that  although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians  it nevertheless was not his own.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it  and here i agreed with him for  however conclusive on paper  it becomes altogether unintelligible  and even absurd  amid the thunder of the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,you have had a good look at the whirl now   said the old man   and if you will creep round this crag  so as to get in its lee  and deaden the roar of the water  i will tell you a story that will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoe str  m.   i placed myself as desired  and he proceeded.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen  with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond moskoe  nearly to vurrgh.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing  at proper opportunities  if one has only the courage to attempt it  but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen  we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands  as i tell you.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there fish can be got at all hours  without much risk  and therefore these places are preferred.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the choice spots over here among the rocks  however  not only yield the finest variety  but in far greater abundance  so that we often got in a single day  what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in fact  we made it a matter of desperate speculation the risk of life standing instead of labor  and courage answering for capital.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this  and it was our practice  in fine weather  to take advantage of the fifteen minutes     slack to push across the main channel of the moskoe str  m  far above the pool  and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm  or sandflesen  where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,here we used to remain until nearly time for slack water again  when we weighed and made for home.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return and we seldom made a mis calculation upon this point.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,twice  during six years  we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm  which is a rare thing indeed just about here  and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week  starving to death  owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival  and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything   for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently  that  at length  we fouled our anchor and dragged it  if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents here to day and gone to morrow which drove us under the lee of flimen  where  by good luck  we brought up.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered     on the grounds     it is a bad spot to be in  even in good weather but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the moskoe str  m itself without accident  although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting  and then we made rather less way than we could wish  while the current rendered the smack unmanageable.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old  and i had two stout boys of my own.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these would have been of great assistance at such times  in using the sweeps  as well as afterward in fishing but  somehow  although we ran the risk ourselves  we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger for  after all is said and done  it was a horrible danger  and that is the truth.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was on the tenth day of july       a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,and yet all the morning  and indeed until late in the afternoon  there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south west  while the sun shone brightly  so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the three of us my two brothers and myself had crossed over to the islands about two o    clock p. m.  and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish  which  we all remarked  were more plenty that day than we had ever known them.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was just seven  by my watch  when we weighed and started for home  so as to make the worst of the str  m at slack water  which we knew would be at eight.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter  and for some time spanked along at a great rate  never dreaming of danger  for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this was most unusual something that had never happened to us before and i began to feel a little uneasy  without exactly knowing why.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we put the boat on the wind  but could make no headway at all for the eddies  and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage  when  looking astern  we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away  and we were dead becalmed  drifting about in every direction.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this state of things  however  did not last long enough to give us time to think about it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in less than a minute the storm was upon us in less than two the sky was entirely overcast and what with this and the driving spray  it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us  but  at the first puff  both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother  who had lashed himself to it for safety.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it had a complete flush deck  with only a small hatch near the bow  and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the str  m  by way of precaution against the chopping seas.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but for this circumstance we should have foundered at once for we lay entirely buried for some moments.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say  for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for my part  as soon as i had let the foresail run  i threw myself flat on deck  with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow  and with my hands grasping a ring bolt near the foot of the fore mast.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was mere instinct that prompted me to do this which was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have done for i was too much flurried to think.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some moments we were completely deluged  as i say  and all this time i held my breath  and clung to the bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees  still keeping hold with my hands  and thus got my head clear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,presently our little boat gave herself a shake  just as a dog does in coming out of the water  and thus rid herself  in some measure  of the seas.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me  and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done  when i felt somebody grasp my arm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was my elder brother  and my heart leaped for joy  for i had made sure that he was overboard but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror for he put his mouth close to my ear  and screamed out the word     moskoe str  m        no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew what he meant by that one word well enough i knew what he wished to make me understand.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,with the wind that now drove us on  we were bound for the whirl of the str  m  and nothing could save us    you perceive that in crossing the str  m channel  we always went a long way up above the whirl  even in the calmest weather  and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack but now we were driving right upon the pool itself  and in such a hurricane as this      to be sure      i thought      we shall get there just about the slack there is some little hope in that     but in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew very well that we were doomed  had we been ten times a ninety gun ship.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself  or perhaps we did not feel it so much  as we scudded before it  but at all events the seas  which at first had been kept down by the wind  and lay flat and frothing  now got up into absolute mountains.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a singular change  too  had come over the heavens.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,around in every direction it was still as black as pitch  but nearly overhead there burst out  all at once  a circular rift of clear sky as clear as i ever saw and of a deep bright blue and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness but  oh god  what a scene it was to light up    i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother but  in some manner which i could not understand  the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word  although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,presently he shook his head  looking as pale as death  and held up one of his fingers  as if to say     listen         at first i could not make out what he meant but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i dragged my watch from its fob.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was not going.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i glanced at its face by the moonlight  and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it had run down at seven o    clock  we were behind the time of the slack  and the whirl of the str  m was in full fury    when a boat is well built  properly trimmed  and not deep laden  the waves in a strong gale  when she is going large  seem always to slip from beneath her which appears very strange to a landsman and this is what is called riding  in sea phrase.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,well  so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly  but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter  and bore us with it as it rose up up as if into the sky.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,and then down we came with a sweep  a slide  and a plunge  that made me feel sick and dizzy  as if i was falling from some lofty mountain top in a dream.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance around and that one glance was all sufficient.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i saw our exact position in an instant.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the moskoe str  m whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead but no more like the every day moskoe str  m than the whirl as you now see it  is like a mill race.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,if i had not known where we were  and what we had to expect  i should not have recognised the place at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as it was  i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside  and were enveloped in foam.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard  and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek such a sound as you might imagine given out by the waste pipes of many thousand steam vessels  letting off their steam all together.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl  and i thought  of course  that another moment would plunge us into the abyss  down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all  but to skim like an air bubble upon the surface of the surge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,her starboard side was next the whirl  and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it may appear strange  but now  when we were in the very jaws of the gulf  i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,having made up my mind to hope no more  i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it may look like boasting but what i tell you is truth i began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner  and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life  in view of so wonderful a manifestation of god    s power.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i positively felt a wish to explore its depths  even at the sacrifice i was going to make  and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,these  no doubt  were singular fancies to occupy a man    s mind in such extremity and i have often thought since  that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light headed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there was another circumstance which tended to restore my self possession  and this was the cessation of the wind  which could not reach us in our present situation for  as you saw yourself  the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean  and this latter now towered above us  a high  black  mountainous ridge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale  you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,they blind  deafen  and strangle you  and take away all power of action or reflection.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but we were now  in a great measure  rid of these annoyances just as death condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences  forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,we careered round and round for perhaps an hour  flying rather than floating  getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge  and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,all this time i had never let go of the ring bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my brother was at the stern  holding on to a small empty water cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter  and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this  and made for the ring  from which  in the agony of his terror  he endeavored to force my hands  as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this act although i knew he was a madman when he did it a raving maniac through sheer fright.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i did not care  however  to contest the point with him.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all  so i let him have the bolt  and went astern to the cask.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this there was no great difficulty in doing  for the smack flew round steadily enough  and upon an even keel only swaying to and fro  with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,scarcely had i secured myself in my new position  when we gave a wild lurch to starboard  and rushed headlong into the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i muttered a hurried prayer to god  and thought all was over.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent  i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel  and closed my eyes.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,for some seconds i dared not open them while i expected instant destruction  and wondered that i was not already in my death struggles with the water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,but moment after moment elapsed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i still lived.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the sense of falling had ceased  and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before  while in the belt of foam  with the exception that she now lay more along.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i took courage  and looked once again upon the scene.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,never shall i forget the sensations of awe  horror  and admiration with which i gazed about me.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the boat appeared to be hanging  as if by magic  midway down  upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference  prodigious in depth  and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony  but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around  and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth  as the rays of the full moon  from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described  streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls  and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,when i recovered myself a little  however  my gaze fell instinctively downward.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view  from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,she was quite upon an even keel that is to say  her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty five degrees  so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam ends.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i could not help observing  nevertheless  that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation  than if we had been upon a dead level  and this  i suppose  was owing to the speed at which we revolved.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf  but still i could make out nothing distinctly  on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped  and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow  like that narrow and tottering bridge which mussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this mist  or spray  was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel  as they all met together at the bottom but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist  i dare not attempt to describe.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our first slide into the abyss itself  from the belt of foam above  had carried us a great distance down the slope  but our farther descent was by no means proportionate.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,round and round we swept not with any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks  that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,our progress downward  at each revolution  was slow  but very perceptible.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne  i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels  large masses of building timber and trunks of trees  with many smaller articles  such as pieces of house furniture  broken boxes  barrels and staves.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i now began to watch  with a strange interest  the numerous things that floated in our company.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i must have been delirious  for i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this fir tree      i found myself at one time saying      will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears      and then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,at length  after making several guesses of this nature  and being deceived in all this fact the fact of my invariable miscalculation  set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble  and my heart beat heavily once more.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was not a new terror that thus affected me  but the dawn of a more exciting hope.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,this hope arose partly from memory  and partly from present observation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden  having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoe str  m. by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters but then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide  or  for some reason  had descended so slowly after entering  that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came  or of the ebb  as the case might be.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i conceived it possible  in either instance  that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean  without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early  or absorbed more rapidly.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i made  also  three important observations.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the first was  that  as a general rule  the larger the bodies were  the more rapid their descent the second  that  between two masses of equal extent  the one spherical  and the other of any other shape  the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere the third  that  between two masses of equal size  the one cylindrical  and the other of any other shape  the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,since my escape  i have had several conversations on this subject with an old school master of the district  and it was from him that i learned the use of the words     cylinder     and     sphere.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,he explained to me although i have forgotten the explanation how what i observed was  in fact  the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments and showed me how it happened that a cylinder  swimming in a vortex  offered more resistance to its suction  and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body  of any form whatever.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations  and rendering me anxious to turn them to account  and this was that  at every revolution  we passed something like a barrel  or else the yard or the mast of a vessel  while many of these things  which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool  were now high up above us  and seemed to have moved but little from their original station.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i no longer hesitated what to do.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held  to cut it loose from the counter  and to throw myself with it into the water.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i attracted my brother    s attention by signs  pointed to the floating barrels that came near us  and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i thought at length that he comprehended my design but  whether this was the case or not  he shook his head despairingly  and refused to move from his station by the ring bolt.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was impossible to reach him  the emergency admitted of no delay  and so  with a bitter struggle  i resigned him to his fate  fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter  and precipitated myself with it into the sea  without another moment    s hesitation.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,as it is myself who now tell you this tale as you see that i did escape and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected  and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to say i will bring my story quickly to conclusion.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it might have been an hour  or thereabout  after my quitting the smack  when  having descended to a vast distance beneath me  it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession  and  bearing my loved brother with it  plunged headlong  at once and forever  into the chaos of foam below.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard  before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the gyrations of the whirl grew  gradually  less and less violent.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,by degrees  the froth and the rainbow disappeared  and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,the sky was clear  the winds had gone down  and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west  when i found myself on the surface of the ocean  in full view of the shores of lofoden  and above the spot where the pool of the moskoe str  m had been.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,it was the hour of the slack but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i was borne violently into the channel of the str  m  and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the     grounds     of the fishermen.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,a boat picked me up exhausted from fatigue and  now that the danger was removed  speechless from the memory of its horror.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit land.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,my hair which had been raven black the day before  was as white as you see it now.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i told them my story they did not believe it.
A Decent into the Maelstrom,i now tell it to you and i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of lofoden.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery, after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago  to say nothing of the summary in     silliman    s journal      with the detailed statement just published by lieutenant maury  it will not be supposed  of course  that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to von kempelen    s discovery  i have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my object is simply  in the first place  to say a few words of von kempelen himself  with whom  some years ago  i had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance   since every thing which concerns him must necessarily  at this moment  be of interest  and  in the second place  to look in a general way  and speculatively  at the results of the discovery.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it may be as well  however  to premise the cursory observations which i have to offer  by denying  very decidedly  what seems to be a general impression  gleaned  as usual in a case of this kind  from the newspapers   viz.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that this discovery  astounding as it unquestionably is  is unanticipated.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,by reference to the     diary of sir humphrey davy      cottle and munroe  london  pp.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it will be seen at pp.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,and     that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question  but had actually made no inconsiderable progress  experimentally  in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by von kempelen  who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it  is  without doubt  i say it unhesitatingly  and can prove it  if required   indebted to the     diary     for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the paragraph from the     courier and enquirer      which is now going the rounds of the press  and which purports to claim the invention for a mr. kissam  of brunswick  maine  appears to me  i confess  a little apocryphal  for several reasons  although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i need not go into details.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it does not look true.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,persons who are narrating facts  are seldom so particular as mr. kissam seems to be  about day and date and precise location.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,besides  if mr. kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did  at the period designated nearly eight years ago how happens it that he took no steps  on the instant  to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually  if not to the world at large  from the discovery  it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what mr. kissam says he did  and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby so like an owl as mr. kissam admits that he did.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,by the way  who is mr. kissam  and is not the whole paragraph in the     courier and enquirer     a fabrication got up to     make a talk      it must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon hoaxy air.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,very little dependence is to be placed upon it  in my humble opinion  and if i were not well aware  from experience  how very easily men of science are mystified  on points out of their usual range of inquiry  i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as professor draper  discussing mr. kissam    s  or is it mr. quizzem    s   pretensions to the discovery  in so serious a tone.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,but to return to the     diary     of sir humphrey davy.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye  even upon the decease of the writer  as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,at page     for example  near the middle  we read  in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote      in less than half a minute the respiration being continued  diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that the respiration was not     diminished      is not only clear by the subsequent context  but by the use of the plural      were.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the sentence  no doubt  was thus intended      in less than half a minute  the respiration  being continued  these feelings  diminished gradually  and were succeeded by  a sensation  analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,a hundred similar instances go to show that the ms. so inconsiderately published  was merely a rough note book  meant only for the writer    s own eye  but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the fact is  sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery  but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical  so that  however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question  he would never have spoken out  until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched  could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this     diary      full of crude speculations  would have been unattended to  as  it seems  they were.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i say     his wishes      for that he meant to include this note book among the miscellaneous papers directed     to be burnt      i think there can be no manner of doubt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad  yet remains to be seen.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that the passages quoted above  with the other similar ones referred to  gave von kempelen the hint  i do not in the slightest degree question  but i repeat  it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself  momentous under any circumstances  will be of service or disservice to mankind at large.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that von kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest  it would be folly to doubt for a moment.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they will scarcely be so weak as not to     realize      in time  by large purchases of houses and land  with other property of intrinsic value.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in the brief account of von kempelen which appeared in the     home journal      and has since been extensively copied  several misapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by the translator  who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the presburg     schnellpost.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,viele     has evidently been misconceived  as it often is   and what the translator renders by     sorrows      is probably     lieden      which  in its true version      sufferings      would give a totally different complexion to the whole account  but  of course  much of this is merely guess  on my part.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,von kempelen  however  is by no means     a misanthrope      in appearance  at least  whatever he may be in fact.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,my acquaintance with him was casual altogether  and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know him at all  but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained  or will attain in a few days  is not a small matter  as times go.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the literary world  speaks of him  confidently  as a native of presburg  misled  perhaps  by the account in  the home journal   but i am pleased in being able to state positively  since i have it from his own lips  that he was born in utica  in the state of new york  although both his parents  i believe  are of presburg descent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the family is connected  in some way  with m  elzel  of automaton chess player memory.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in person  he is short and stout  with large  fat  blue eyes  sandy hair and whiskers  a wide but pleasing mouth  fine teeth  and i think a roman nose.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,there is some defect in one of his feet.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his address is frank  and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,altogether  he looks  speaks  and acts as little like     a misanthrope     as any man i ever saw.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,we were fellow sojourners for a week about six years ago  at earl    s hotel  in providence  rhode island  and i presume that i conversed with him  at various times  for some three or four hours altogether.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his principal topics were those of the day  and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,he left the hotel before me  intending to go to new york  and thence to bremen  it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public  or  rather  it was there that he was first suspected of having made it.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,this is about all that i personally know of the now immortal von kempelen  but i have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions  entitled to about as much credit as the story of aladdin    s lamp  and yet  in a case of this kind  as in the case of the discoveries in california  it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the following anecdote  at least  is so well authenticated  that we may receive it implicitly.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at bremen  and often  it was well known  he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,when the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of gutsmuth   co.  suspicion was directed toward von kempelen  on account of his having purchased a considerable property in gasperitch lane  and his refusing  when questioned  to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,he was at length arrested  but nothing decisive appearing against him  was in the end set at liberty.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the police  however  kept a strict watch upon his movements  and thus discovered that he left home frequently  taking always the same road  and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the     dondergat.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,finally  by dint of great perseverance  they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories  in an alley called flatzplatz  and  coming upon him suddenly  found him  as they imagined  in the midst of his counterfeiting operations.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,his agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,after hand cuffing him  they searched his room  or rather rooms  for it appears he occupied all the mansarde.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,opening into the garret where they caught him  was a closet  ten feet by eight  fitted up with some chemical apparatus  of which the object has not yet been ascertained.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in one corner of the closet was a very small furnace  with a glowing fire in it  and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible two crucibles connected by a tube.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,one of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion  but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube  which was close to the brim.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the other crucible had some liquid in it  which  as the officers entered  seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they relate that  on finding himself taken  kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands  which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic   and threw the contents on the tiled floor.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it was now that they hand cuffed him  and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person  but nothing unusual was found about him  excepting a paper parcel  in his coat pocket  containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance  in nearly  but not quite  equal proportions.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have  so far  failed  but that it will ultimately be analyzed  is not to be doubted.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,passing out of the closet with their prisoner  the officers went through a sort of ante chamber  in which nothing material was found  to the chemist    s sleeping room.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,they here rummaged some drawers and boxes  but discovered only a few papers  of no importance  and some good coin  silver and gold.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,at length  looking under the bed  they saw a large  common hair trunk  without hinges  hasp  or lock  and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed  they found that  with their united strength  there were three of them  all powerful men   they     could not stir it one inch.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,much astonished at this  one of them crawled under the bed  and looking into the trunk  said       no wonder we couldn    t move it why it    s full to the brim of old bits of brass       putting his feet  now  against the wall so as to get a good purchase  and pushing with all his force  while his companions pulled with all theirs  the trunk  with much difficulty  was slid out from under the bed  and its contents examined.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small  smooth pieces  varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar  but the pieces were irregular in shape  although more or less flat looking  upon the whole   very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state  and there suffered to grow cool.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,now  not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be anything but brass.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the idea of its being gold never entered their brains  of course  how could such a wild fancy have entered it  and their astonishment may be well conceived  when the next day it became known  all over bremen  that the  lot of brass  which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office  without putting themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap  was not only gold real gold but gold far finer than any employed in coinage gold  in fact  absolutely pure  virgin  without the slightest appreciable alloy.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,i need not go over the details of von kempelen    s confession  as far as it went  and release  for these are familiar to the public.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that he has actually realized  in spirit and in effect  if not to the letter  the old chimaera of the philosopher    s stone  no sane person is at liberty to doubt.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the opinions of arago are  of course  entitled to the greatest consideration  but he is by no means infallible  and what he says of bismuth  in his report to the academy  must be taken cum grano salis.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,the simple truth is  that up to this period all analysis has failed  and until von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma  it is more than probable that the matter will remain  for years  in statu quo.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is  that     pure gold can be made at will  and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances  in kind and in proportions  unknown.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,speculation  of course  is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally  by the late developments in california  and this reflection brings us inevitably to another the exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelen    s analysis.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,if many were prevented from adventuring to california  by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value  on account of its plentifulness in the mines there  as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one what impression will be wrought now  upon the minds of those about to emigrate  and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region  by the announcement of this astounding discovery of von kempelen  a discovery which declares  in so many words  that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes  whatever that worth may be   gold now is  or at least soon will be  for it cannot be supposed that von kempelen can long retain his secret   of no greater value than lead  and of far inferior value to silver.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,it is  indeed  exceedingly difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery  but one thing may be positively maintained that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of california.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in europe  as yet  the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,in the price of lead  and nearly twenty five per cent.
Von Kempelen and his Discovery,that of silver.
Mesmeric Revelation, whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism  its startling facts are now almost universally admitted.
Mesmeric Revelation,of these latter  those who doubt  are your mere doubters by profession an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.
Mesmeric Revelation,there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove  at the present day  that man  by mere exercise of will  can so impress his fellow  as to cast him into an abnormal condition  of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death  or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance  that  while in this state  the person so impressed employs only with effort  and then feebly  the external organs of sense  yet perceives  with keenly refined perception  and through channels supposed unknown  matters beyond the scope of the physical organs  that  moreover  his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated  that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound  and  finally  that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency  while  in the same proportion  the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced.
Mesmeric Revelation,i say that these which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features it would be supererogation to demonstrate  nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration  to day.
Mesmeric Revelation,my purpose at present is a very different one indeed.
Mesmeric Revelation,i am impelled  even in the teeth of a world of prejudice  to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy  occurring between a sleep waker and myself.
Mesmeric Revelation,i had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question  mr. vankirk   and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened.
Mesmeric Revelation,for many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis  the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations  and on the night of wednesday  the fifteenth instant  i was summoned to his bedside.
Mesmeric Revelation,the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart  and breathed with great difficulty  having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.
Mesmeric Revelation,in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres  but to night this had been attempted in vain.
Mesmeric Revelation,as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile  and although evidently in much bodily pain  appeared to be  mentally  quite at ease.
Mesmeric Revelation,i sent for you to night   he said   not so much to administer to my bodily ailment  as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which  of late  have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise.
Mesmeric Revelation,i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul    s immortality.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot deny that there has always existed  as if in that very soul which i have been denying  a vague half sentiment of its own existence.
Mesmeric Revelation,but this half sentiment at no time amounted to conviction.
Mesmeric Revelation,with it my reason had nothing to do.
Mesmeric Revelation,all attempts at logical inquiry resulted  indeed  in leaving me more sceptical than before.
Mesmeric Revelation,i had been advised to study cousin.
Mesmeric Revelation,i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes.
Mesmeric Revelation,the     charles elwood     of mr. brownson  for example  was placed in my hands.
Mesmeric Revelation,i read it with profound attention.
Mesmeric Revelation,throughout i found it logical  but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book.
Mesmeric Revelation,in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself.
Mesmeric Revelation,his end had plainly forgotten his beginning  like the government of trinculo.
Mesmeric Revelation,in short  i was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality  he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england  of france  and of germany.
Mesmeric Revelation,abstractions may amuse and exercise  but take no hold on the mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,here upon earth  at least  philosophy  i am persuaded  will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.
Mesmeric Revelation,the will may assent the soul the intellect  never.
Mesmeric Revelation,i repeat  then  that i only half felt  and never intellectually believed.
Mesmeric Revelation,but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling  until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason  that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two.
Mesmeric Revelation,i am enabled  too  plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which  in my abnormal existence  convinces  but which  in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena  does not extend  except through its effect  into my normal condition.
Mesmeric Revelation,in sleep waking  the reasoning and its conclusion the cause and its effect are present together.
Mesmeric Revelation,in my natural state  the cause vanishing  the effect only  and perhaps only partially  remains.
Mesmeric Revelation,these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.
Mesmeric Revelation,you have often observed the profound self cognizance evinced by the sleep waker the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself  and from this self cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism.
Mesmeric Revelation,i consented of course to make this experiment.
Mesmeric Revelation,a few passes threw mr. vankirk into the mesmeric sleep.
Mesmeric Revelation,his breathing became immediately more easy  and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.
Mesmeric Revelation,the following conversation then ensued  v. in the dialogue representing the patient  and p. myself.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. are you asleep   v. yes no  i would rather sleep more soundly.
Mesmeric Revelation,p.  after a few more passes.
Mesmeric Revelation,do you sleep now   v. yes.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. how do you think your present illness will result   v.  after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.
Mesmeric Revelation,i must die.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. does the idea of death afflict you   v.  very quickly.
Mesmeric Revelation,no no   p. are you pleased with the prospect   v. if i were awake i should like to die  but now it is no matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. i wish you would explain yourself  mr. vankirk.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. i am willing to do so  but it requires more effort than i feel able to make.
Mesmeric Revelation,you do not question me properly.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what then shall i ask   v. you must begin at the beginning.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. the beginning  but where is the beginning   v. you know that the beginning is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,this was said in a low  fluctuating tone  and with every sign of the most profound veneration.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what then  is god   v.  hesitating for many minutes.
Mesmeric Revelation,i cannot tell.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is not god spirit   v. while i was awake i knew what you meant by  spirit   but now it seems only a word such  for instance  as truth  beauty a quality  i mean.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is not god immaterial   v. there is no immateriality it is a mere word.
Mesmeric Revelation,that which is not matter  is not at all unless qualities are things.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. is god  then  material   v. no.
Mesmeric Revelation,this reply startled me very much.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. what  then  is he   v.  after a long pause  and mutteringly.
Mesmeric Revelation,i see but it is a thing difficult to tell.
Mesmeric Revelation,another long pause.
Mesmeric Revelation,he is not spirit  for he exists.
Mesmeric Revelation,nor is he matter  as you understand it.
Mesmeric Revelation,but there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing  the grosser impelling the finer  the finer pervading the grosser.
Mesmeric Revelation,the atmosphere  for example  impels the electric principle  while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere.
Mesmeric Revelation,these gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness  until we arrive at a matter unparticled without particles indivisible one  and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate  or unparticled matter  not only permeates all things but impels all things  and thus is all things within itself.
Mesmeric Revelation,this matter is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,what men attempt to embody in the word  thought   is this matter in motion.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking  and that the latter is the origin of the former.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes  and i now see the confusion of idea.
Mesmeric Revelation,motion is the action of mind  not of thinking.
Mesmeric Revelation,the unparticled matter  or god  in quiescence  is  as nearly as we can conceive it  what men call mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,and the power of self movement  equivalent in effect to human volition  is  in the unparticled matter  the result of its unity and omniprevalence  how i know not  and now clearly see that i shall never know.
Mesmeric Revelation,but the unparticled matter  set in motion by a law  or quality  existing within itself  is thinking.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter   v. the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation.
Mesmeric Revelation,we have  for example  a metal  a piece of wood  a drop of water  the atmosphere  a gas  caloric  electricity  the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,now we call all these things matter  and embrace all matter in one general definition  but in spite of this  there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal  and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,when we reach the latter  we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit  or with nihility.
Mesmeric Revelation,the only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution  and here  even  we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom  as something possessing in infinite minuteness  solidity  palpability  weight.
Mesmeric Revelation,destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity  or at least as matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,for want of a better word we might term it spirit.
Mesmeric Revelation,take  now  a step beyond the luminiferous ether conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether  as this ether is more rare than the metal  and we arrive at once  in spite of all the school dogmas  at a unique mass an unparticled matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,for although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves  the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.
Mesmeric Revelation,there will be a point there will be a degree of rarity  at which  if the atoms are sufficiently numerous  the interspaces must vanish  and the mass absolutely coalesce.
Mesmeric Revelation,but the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away  the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is clear  however  that it is as fully matter as before.
Mesmeric Revelation,the truth is  it is impossible to conceive spirit  since it is impossible to imagine what is not.
Mesmeric Revelation,when we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception  we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence  and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space a resistance now ascertained  it is true  to exist in some degree  but which is  nevertheless  so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of newton.
Mesmeric Revelation,we know that the resistance of bodies is  chiefly  in proportion to their density.
Mesmeric Revelation,absolute coalescence is absolute density.
Mesmeric Revelation,where there are no interspaces  there can be no yielding.
Mesmeric Revelation,an ether  absolutely dense  would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.
Mesmeric Revelation,as regards the progress of the star  it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it.
Mesmeric Revelation,there is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether  for  however rare this ether be supposed  it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend.
Mesmeric Revelation,the retardation actually experienced is  on the other hand  about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb.
Mesmeric Revelation,in the one case  the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself in the other it is endlessly accumulative.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but in all this in this identification of mere matter with god is there nothing of irreverence   i was forced to repeat this question before the sleep waker fully comprehended my meaning.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind  but you forget that the matter of which i speak is  in all respects  the very  mind  or  spirit  of the schools  so far as regards its high capacities  and is  moreover  the  matter  of these schools at the same time.
Mesmeric Revelation,god  with all the powers attributed to spirit  is but the perfection of matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you assert  then  that the unparticled matter  in motion  is thought   v. in general  this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,this thought creates.
Mesmeric Revelation,all created things are but the thoughts of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say   in general.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes.
Mesmeric Revelation,the universal mind is god.
Mesmeric Revelation,for new individualities  matter is necessary.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but you now speak of  mind  and  matter  as do the metaphysicians.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes to avoid confusion.
Mesmeric Revelation,when i say  mind   i mean the unparticled or ultimate matter  by  matter   i intend all else.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you were saying that  for new individualities matter is necessary.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. yes  for mind  existing unincorporate  is merely god.
Mesmeric Revelation,to create individual  thinking beings  it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus man is individualized.
Mesmeric Revelation,divested of corporate investiture  he were god.
Mesmeric Revelation,now  the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man  as the motion of the whole is that of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say that divested of the body man will be god   v.  after much hesitation.
Mesmeric Revelation,i could not have said this  it is an absurdity.
Mesmeric Revelation,p.  referring to my notes.
Mesmeric Revelation,you did say that  divested of corporate investiture man were god.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. and this is true.
Mesmeric Revelation,man thus divested would be god would be unindividualized.
Mesmeric Revelation,but he can never be thus divested at least never will be else we must imagine an action of god returning upon itself a purposeless and futile action.
Mesmeric Revelation,man is a creature.
Mesmeric Revelation,creatures are thoughts of god.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. i do not comprehend.
Mesmeric Revelation,you say that man will never put off the body   v. i say that he will never be bodiless.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. explain.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. there are two bodies the rudimental and the complete  corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.
Mesmeric Revelation,what we call  death   is but the painful metamorphosis.
Mesmeric Revelation,our present incarnation is progressive  preparatory  temporary.
Mesmeric Revelation,our future is perfected  ultimate  immortal.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate life is the full design.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but of the worm    s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. we  certainly but not the worm.
Mesmeric Revelation,the matter of which our rudimental body is composed  is within the ken of the organs of that body  or  more distinctly  our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body  but not to that of which the ultimate is composed.
Mesmeric Revelation,the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses  and we perceive only the shell which falls  in decaying  from the inner form  not that inner form itself  but this inner form  as well as the shell  is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death.
Mesmeric Revelation,how is this   v. when i say that it resembles death  i mean that it resembles the ultimate life  for when i am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance  and i perceive external things directly  without organs  through a medium which i shall employ in the ultimate  unorganized life.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. unorganized   v. yes  organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter  to the exclusion of other classes and forms.
Mesmeric Revelation,the organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition  and to that only  his ultimate condition  being unorganized  is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one the nature of the volition of god that is to say  the motion of the unparticled matter.
Mesmeric Revelation,you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.
Mesmeric Revelation,this it is not  but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is.
Mesmeric Revelation,a luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.
Mesmeric Revelation,the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina  these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve.
Mesmeric Revelation,the nerve conveys similar ones to the brain  the brain  also  similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.
Mesmeric Revelation,the motion of this latter is thought  of which perception is the first undulation.
Mesmeric Revelation,this is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world  and this external world is  to the rudimental life  limited  through the idiosyncrasy of its organs.
Mesmeric Revelation,but in the ultimate  unorganized life  the external world reaches the whole body   which is of a substance having affinity to brain  as i have said   with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous  and to this ether in unison with it the whole body vibrates  setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it.
Mesmeric Revelation,it is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs  therefore  that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life.
Mesmeric Revelation,to rudimental beings  organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you speak of rudimental  beings.
Mesmeric Revelation,are there other rudimental thinking beings than man   v. the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul    planets  suns  and other bodies which are neither nebul    suns  nor planets  is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.
Mesmeric Revelation,but for the necessity of the rudimental  prior to the ultimate life  there would have been no bodies such as these.
Mesmeric Revelation,each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic  rudimental  thinking creatures.
Mesmeric Revelation,in all  the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted.
Mesmeric Revelation,at death  or metamorphosis  these creatures  enjoying the ultimate life immortality and cognizant of all secrets but the one  act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition  indwelling  not the stars  which to us seem the sole palpabilities  and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created but that space itself that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star shadows blotting them out as non entities from the perception of the angels.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. you say that  but for the necessity of the rudimental life  there would have been no stars.
Mesmeric Revelation,but why this necessity   v. in the inorganic life  as well as in the inorganic matter generally  there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law the divine volition.
Mesmeric Revelation,with the view of producing impediment  the organic life and matter   complex  substantial  and law encumbered   were contrived.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but again why need this impediment have been produced   v. the result of law inviolate is perfection right negative happiness.
Mesmeric Revelation,the result of law violate is imperfection  wrong  positive pain.
Mesmeric Revelation,through the impediments afforded by the number  complexity  and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter  the violation of law is rendered  to a certain extent  practicable.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus pain  which in the inorganic life is impossible  is possible in the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible   v. all things are either good or bad by comparison.
Mesmeric Revelation,a sufficient analysis will show that pleasure  in all cases  is but the contrast of pain.
Mesmeric Revelation,positive pleasure is a mere idea.
Mesmeric Revelation,to be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same.
Mesmeric Revelation,never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.
Mesmeric Revelation,but it has been shown that  in the inorganic life  pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,the pain of the primitive life of earth  is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in heaven.
Mesmeric Revelation,p. still  there is one of your expressions which i find it impossible to comprehend  the truly substantive vastness of infinity.
Mesmeric Revelation,v. this  probably  is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term  substance  itself.
Mesmeric Revelation,we must not regard it as a quality  but as a sentiment  it is the perception  in thinking beings  of the adaptation of matter to their organization.
Mesmeric Revelation,there are many things on the earth  which would be nihility to the inhabitants of venus many things visible and tangible in venus  which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all.
Mesmeric Revelation,but to the inorganic beings to the angels the whole of the unparticled matter is substance that is to say  the whole of what we term  space  is to them the truest substantiality  the stars  meantime  through what we consider their materiality  escaping the angelic sense  just in proportion as the unparticled matter  through what we consider its immateriality  eludes the organic.
Mesmeric Revelation,as the sleep waker pronounced these latter words  in a feeble tone  i observed on his countenance a singular expression  which somewhat alarmed me  and induced me to awake him at once.
Mesmeric Revelation,no sooner had i done this  than  with a bright smile irradiating all his features  he fell back upon his pillow and expired.
Mesmeric Revelation,i noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.
Mesmeric Revelation,his brow was of the coldness of ice.
Mesmeric Revelation,thus  ordinarily  should it have appeared  only after long pressure from azrael    s hand.
Mesmeric Revelation,had the sleep waker  indeed  during the latter portion of his discourse  been addressing me from out the region of the shadows
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar, of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder  that the extraordinary case of m. valdemar has excited discussion.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it would have been a miracle had it not especially under the circumstances.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,through the desire of all parties concerned  to keep the affair from the public  at least for the present  or until we had farther opportunities for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society  and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations  and  very naturally  of a great deal of disbelief.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i comprehend them myself.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,they are  succinctly  these   my attention  for the last three years  had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism  and  about nine months ago it occurred to me  quite suddenly  that in the series of experiments made hitherto  there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission  no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it remained to be seen  first  whether  in such condition  there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence  secondly  whether  if any existed  it was impaired or increased by the condition  thirdly  to what extent  or for how long a period  the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there were other points to be ascertained  but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial  from the immensely important character of its consequences.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars  i was brought to think of my friend  m. ernest valdemar  the well known compiler of the  bibliotheca forensica   and author  under the nom de plume of issachar marx  of the polish versions of  wallenstein  and  gargantua.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,m. valdemar  who has resided principally at harlem  n.y.  since the year       is  or was  particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much resembling those of john randolph  and  also  for the whiteness of his whiskers  in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter  in consequence  being very generally mistaken for a wig.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his temperament was markedly nervous  and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty  but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his will was at no period positively  or thoroughly  under my control  and in regard to clairvoyance  i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him  his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was his custom  indeed  to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution  as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me  it was of course very natural that i should think of m. valdemar.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him  and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i spoke to him frankly upon the subject  and  to my surprise  his interest seemed vividly excited.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i say to my surprise  for  although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments  he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death  and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it is now rather more than seven months since i received  from m. valdemar himself  the subjoined note   my dear p     you may as well come now.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,d   and f   are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond to morrow midnight  and i think they have hit the time very nearly.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,valdemar  i received this note within half an hour after it was written  and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man    s chamber.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i had not seen him for ten days  and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his face wore a leaden hue  the eyes were utterly lustreless  and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek bones.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,his expectoration was excessive.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the pulse was barely perceptible.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he retained  nevertheless  in a very remarkable manner  both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid and  when i entered the room  was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket book.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he was propped up in the bed by pillows.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,doctors d   and f   were in attendance.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after pressing valdemar    s hand  i took these gentlemen aside  and obtained from them a minute account of the patient    s condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi osseous or cartilaginous state  and was  of course  entirely useless for all purposes of vitality.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the right  in its upper portion  was also partially  if not thoroughly  ossified  while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles  running one into another.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,several extensive perforations existed  and  at one point  permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity  no sign of it had been discovered a month before  and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,independently of the phthisis  the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta  but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was the opinion of both physicians that m. valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow  sunday .
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was then seven o    clock on saturday evening.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,on quitting the invalid    s bed side to hold conversation with myself  doctors d   and f   had bidden him a final farewell.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it had not been their intention to return  but  at my request  they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when they had gone  i spoke freely with m. valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution  as well as  more particularly  of the experiment proposed.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made  and urged me to commence it at once.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,a male and a female nurse were in attendance  but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people  in case of sudden accident  might prove.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night  when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance   mr. theodore l l   relieved me from farther embarrassment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it had been my design  originally  to wait for the physicians  but i was induced to proceed  first  by the urgent entreaties of m. valdemar  and secondly  by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose  as he was evidently sinking fast.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,mr. l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred  and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is  for the most part  either condensed or copied verbatim.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it wanted about five minutes of eight when  taking the patient    s hand  i begged him to state  as distinctly as he could  to mr. l l  whether he  m. valdemar  was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he replied feebly  yet quite audibly   yes  i wish to be.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i fear you have mesmerized  adding immediately afterwards   i fear you have deferred it too long.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,while he spoke thus  i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead  but although i exerted all my powers  no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o    clock  when doctors d   and f   called  according to appointment.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i explained to them  in a few words  what i designed  and as they opposed no objection  saying that the patient was already in the death agony  i proceeded without hesitation exchanging  however  the lateral passes for downward ones  and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous  and at intervals of half a minute.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at the expiration of this period  however  a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man  and the stertorous breathing ceased that is to say  its stertorousness was no longer apparent  the intervals were undiminished.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the patient    s extremities were of an icy coldness.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep waking  and which it is quite impossible to mistake.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver  as in incipient sleep  and with a few more i closed them altogether.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i was not satisfied  however  with this  but continued the manipulations vigorously  and with the fullest exertion of the will  until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer  after placing them in a seemingly easy position.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the legs were at full length  the arms were nearly so  and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the head was very slightly elevated.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,when i had accomplished this  it was fully midnight  and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m. valdemar    s condition.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after a few experiments  they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,dr. d   resolved at once to remain with the patient all night  while dr. f   took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,mr. l l and the nurses remained.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,we left m. valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o    clock in the morning  when i approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr. f   went away that is to say  he lay in the same position  the pulse was imperceptible  the breathing was gentle  scarcely noticeable  unless through the application of a mirror to the lips   the eyes were closed naturally  and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,still  the general appearance was certainly not that of death.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,as i approached m. valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own  as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in such experiments with this patient  i had never perfectly succeeded before  and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now  but to my astonishment  his arm very readily  although feebly  followed every direction i assigned it with mine.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i determined to hazard a few words of conversation.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,m. valdemar   i said   are you asleep   he made no answer  but i perceived a tremor about the lips  and was thus induced to repeat the question  again and again.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at its third repetition  his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering  the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the ball  the lips moved sluggishly  and from between them  in a barely audible whisper  issued the words    yes  asleep now.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,do not wake me  let me die so    i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the right arm  as before  obeyed the direction of my hand.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i questioned the sleep waker again    do you still feel pain in the breast  m. valdemar    the answer now was immediate  but even less audible than before    no pain i am dying.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then  and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr. f    who came a little before sunrise  and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips  he requested me to speak to the sleep waker again.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did so  saying    m. valdemar  do you still sleep    as before  some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made  and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i concluded  however  to speak to him once more  and merely repeated my previous question.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,while i spoke  there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep waker.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the eyes rolled themselves slowly open  the pupils disappearing upwardly  the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue  resembling not so much parchment as white paper  and the circular hectic spots which  hitherto  had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek  went out at once.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i use this expression  because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there are  indeed  two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part  i might say  for example  that the sound was harsh  and broken and hollow  but the hideous whole is indescribable  for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,there were two particulars  nevertheless  which i thought then  and still think  might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in the first place  the voice seemed to reach our ears at least mine from a vast distance  or from some deep cavern within the earth.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in the second place  it impressed me  i fear  indeed  that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended  as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it was evident that  so far  death  or what is usually termed death  had been arrested by the mesmeric process.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m. valdemar would be merely to insure his instant  or at least his speedy  dissolution.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly seven months we continued to make daily calls at m. valdemar    s house  accompanied  now and then  by medical and other friends.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,all this time the sleeper waker remained exactly as i have last described him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,the nurses     attentions were continual.
The Facts in the Case of M.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,i did so  as follows    m. valdemar  can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now    there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks  the tongue quivered  or rather rolled violently in the mouth  although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before   and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described  broke forth    for god    s sake  quick  quick  put me to sleep or  quick  waken me  quick  i say to you that i am dead    i was thoroughly unnerved  and for an instant remained undecided what to do.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,at first i made an endeavor to recompose the patient  but  failing in this through total abeyance of the will  i retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,in this attempt i soon saw that i should be successful or at least i soon fancied that my success would be complete and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,for what really occurred  however  it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes  amid ejaculations of  dead  dead   absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer  his whole frame at once within the space of a single minute  or even less  shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,upon the bed  before that whole company  there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome of detestable putrescence.
The Black Cat, for the most wild  yet most homely narrative which i am about to pen  i neither expect nor solicit belief.
The Black Cat,mad indeed would i be to expect it  in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.
The Black Cat,yet  mad am i not and very surely do i not dream.
The Black Cat,but to morrow i die  and to day i would unburthen my soul.
The Black Cat,my immediate purpose is to place before the world  plainly  succinctly  and without comment  a series of mere household events.
The Black Cat,in their consequences  these events have terrified have tortured have destroyed me.
The Black Cat,yet i will not attempt to expound them.
The Black Cat,to me  they have presented little but horror to many they will seem less terrible than barroques.
The Black Cat,hereafter  perhaps  some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common place some intellect more calm  more logical  and far less excitable than my own  which will perceive  in the circumstances i detail with awe  nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.
The Black Cat,from my infancy i was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.
The Black Cat,my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.
The Black Cat,i was especially fond of animals  and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.
The Black Cat,with these i spent most of my time  and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.
The Black Cat,this peculiarity of character grew with my growth  and in my manhood  i derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.
The Black Cat,to those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog  i need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable.
The Black Cat,there is something in the unselfish and self sacrificing love of a brute  which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man.
The Black Cat,i married early  and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.
The Black Cat,observing my partiality for domestic pets  she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind.
The Black Cat,we had birds  gold fish  a fine dog  rabbits  a small monkey  and a cat.
The Black Cat,this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal  entirely black  and sagacious to an astonishing degree.
The Black Cat,in speaking of his intelligence  my wife  who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition  made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion  which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise.
The Black Cat,not that she was ever serious upon this point and i mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens  just now  to be remembered.
The Black Cat,pluto this was the cat    s name was my favorite pet and playmate.
The Black Cat,i alone fed him  and he attended me wherever i went about the house.
The Black Cat,it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from following me through the streets.
The Black Cat,our friendship lasted  in this manner  for several years  during which my general temperament and character through the instrumentality of the fiend intemperance had  i blush to confess it  experienced a radical alteration for the worse.
The Black Cat,i grew  day by day  more moody  more irritable  more regardless of the feelings of others.
The Black Cat,i suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife.
The Black Cat,at length  i even offered her personal violence.
The Black Cat,my pets  of course  were made to feel the change in my disposition.
The Black Cat,i not only neglected  but ill used them.
The Black Cat,for pluto  however  i still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him  as i made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits  the monkey  or even the dog  when by accident  or through affection  they came in my way.
The Black Cat,but my disease grew upon me for what disease is like alcohol  and at length even pluto  who was now becoming old  and consequently somewhat peevish even pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.
The Black Cat,one night  returning home  much intoxicated  from one of my haunts about town  i fancied that the cat avoided my presence.
The Black Cat,i seized him  when  in his fright at my violence  he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.
The Black Cat,the fury of a demon instantly possessed me.
The Black Cat,i knew myself no longer.
The Black Cat,my original soul seemed  at once  to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence  gin nurtured  thrilled every fibre of my frame.
The Black Cat,i took from my waistcoat pocket a pen knife  opened it  grasped the poor beast by the throat  and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket  i blush  i burn  i shudder  while i pen the damnable atrocity.
The Black Cat,when reason returned with the morning when i had slept off the fumes of the night    s debauch i experienced a sentiment half of horror  half of remorse  for the crime of which i had been guilty  but it was  at best  a feeble and equivocal feeling  and the soul remained untouched.
The Black Cat,i again plunged into excess  and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.
The Black Cat,in the meantime the cat slowly recovered.
The Black Cat,the socket of the lost eye presented  it is true  a frightful appearance  but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain.
The Black Cat,he went about the house as usual  but  as might be expected  fled in extreme terror at my approach.
The Black Cat,i had so much of my old heart left  as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.
The Black Cat,but this feeling soon gave place to irritation.
The Black Cat,and then came  as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow  the spirit of perverseness.
The Black Cat,of this spirit philosophy takes no account.
The Black Cat,yet i am not more sure that my soul lives  than i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart one of the indivisible primary faculties  or sentiments  which give direction to the character of man.
The Black Cat,who has not  a hundred times  found himself committing a vile or a silly action  for no other reason than because he knows he should not  have we not a perpetual inclination  in the teeth of our best judgment  to violate that which is law  merely because we understand it to be such  this spirit of perverseness  i say  came to my final overthrow.
The Black Cat,it was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself to offer violence to its own nature to do wrong for the wrong    s sake only that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the unoffending brute.
The Black Cat,one morning  in cool blood  i slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree  hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes  and with the bitterest remorse at my heart  hung it because i knew that it had loved me  and because i felt it had given me no reason of offence  hung it because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sin a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it if such a thing wore possible even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible god.
The Black Cat,on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done  i was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.
The Black Cat,the curtains of my bed were in flames.
The Black Cat,the whole house was blazing.
The Black Cat,it was with great difficulty that my wife  a servant  and myself  made our escape from the conflagration.
The Black Cat,the destruction was complete.
The Black Cat,my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up  and i resigned myself thenceforward to despair.
The Black Cat,i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect  between the disaster and the atrocity.
The Black Cat,but i am detailing a chain of facts and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.
The Black Cat,on the day succeeding the fire  i visited the ruins.
The Black Cat,the walls  with one exception  had fallen in.
The Black Cat,this exception was found in a compartment wall  not very thick  which stood about the middle of the house  and against which had rested the head of my bed.
The Black Cat,the plastering had here  in great measure  resisted the action of the fire a fact which i attributed to its having been recently spread.
The Black Cat,about this wall a dense crowd were collected  and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention.
The Black Cat,the words  strange    singular   and other similar expressions  excited my curiosity.
The Black Cat,i approached and saw  as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface  the figure of a gigantic cat.
The Black Cat,the impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.
The Black Cat,there was a rope about the animal    s neck.
The Black Cat,when i first beheld this apparition for i could scarcely regard it as less my wonder and my terror were extreme.
The Black Cat,but at length reflection came to my aid.
The Black Cat,the cat  i remembered  had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house.
The Black Cat,upon the alarm of fire  this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown  through an open window  into my chamber.
The Black Cat,this had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep.
The Black Cat,the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly spread plaster  the lime of which  with the flames  and the ammonia from the carcass  had then accomplished the portraiture as i saw it.
The Black Cat,although i thus readily accounted to my reason  if not altogether to my conscience  for the startling fact just detailed  it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy.
The Black Cat,for months i could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat  and  during this period  there came back into my spirit a half sentiment that seemed  but was not  remorse.
The Black Cat,i went so far as to regret the loss of the animal  and to look about me  among the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented  for another pet of the same species  and of somewhat similar appearance  with which to supply its place.
The Black Cat,one night as i sat  half stupefied  in a den of more than infamy  my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object  reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin  or of rum  which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.
The Black Cat,i had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes  and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had not sooner perceived the object thereupon.
The Black Cat,i approached it  and touched it with my hand.
The Black Cat,it was a black cat a very large one fully as large as pluto  and closely resembling him in every respect but one.
The Black Cat,pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body  but this cat had a large  although indefinite splotch of white  covering nearly the whole region of the breast.
The Black Cat,upon my touching him  he immediately arose  purred loudly  rubbed against my hand  and appeared delighted with my notice.
The Black Cat,this  then  was the very creature of which i was in search.
The Black Cat,i at once offered to purchase it of the landlord  but this person made no claim to it knew nothing of it had never seen it before.
The Black Cat,i continued my caresses  and  when i prepared to go home  the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.
The Black Cat,i permitted it to do so  occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded.
The Black Cat,when it reached the house it domesticated itself at once  and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.
The Black Cat,for my own part  i soon found a dislike to it arising within me.
The Black Cat,this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated  but i know not how or why it was its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed.
The Black Cat,by slow degrees  these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.
The Black Cat,i avoided the creature  a certain sense of shame  and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty  preventing me from physically abusing it.
The Black Cat,i did not  for some weeks  strike  or otherwise violently ill use it  but gradually very gradually i came to look upon it with unutterable loathing  and to flee silently from its odious presence  as from the breath of a pestilence.
The Black Cat,what added  no doubt  to my hatred of the beast  was the discovery  on the morning after i brought it home  that  like pluto  it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.
The Black Cat,this circumstance  however  only endeared it to my wife  who  as i have already said  possessed  in a high degree  that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait  and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.
The Black Cat,with my aversion to this cat  however  its partiality for myself seemed to increase.
The Black Cat,it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.
The Black Cat,whenever i sat  it would crouch beneath my chair  or spring upon my knees  covering me with its loathsome caresses.
The Black Cat,if i arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down  or  fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress  clamber  in this manner  to my breast.
The Black Cat,at such times  although i longed to destroy it with a blow  i was yet withheld from so doing  partly by a memory of my former crime  but chiefly let me confess it at once by absolute dread of the beast.
The Black Cat,this dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil and yet i should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.
The Black Cat,i am almost ashamed to own yes  even in this felon    s cell  i am almost ashamed to own that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me  had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive.
The Black Cat,my wife had called my attention  more than once  to the character of the mark of white hair  of which i have spoken  and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had destroyed.
The Black Cat,the reader will remember that this mark  although large  had been originally very indefinite  but  by slow degrees degrees nearly imperceptible  and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful it had  at length  assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline.
The Black Cat,it was now the representation of an object that i shudder to name and for this  above all  i loathed  and dreaded  and would have rid myself of the monster had i dared it was now  i say  the image of a hideous of a ghastly thing of the gallows  oh  mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime of agony and of death   and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity.
The Black Cat,and a brute beast  whose fellow i had contemptuously destroyed a brute beast to work out for me for me a man  fashioned in the image of the high god so much of insufferable woe  alas  neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of rest any more  during the former the creature left me no moment alone  and in the latter i started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face  and its vast weight an incarnate nightmare that i had no power to shake off incumbent eternally upon my heart   beneath the pressure of torments such as these  the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed.
The Black Cat,evil thoughts became my sole intimates the darkest and most evil of thoughts.
The Black Cat,the moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind  while  from the sudden  frequent  and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned myself  my uncomplaining wife  alas  was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.
The Black Cat,one day she accompanied me  upon some household errand  into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit.
The Black Cat,the cat followed me down the steep stairs  and  nearly throwing me headlong  exasperated me to madness.
The Black Cat,uplifting an axe  and forgetting  in my wrath  the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand  i aimed a blow at the animal which  of course  would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i wished.
The Black Cat,but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.
The Black Cat,goaded  by the interference  into a rage more than demoniacal  i withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.
The Black Cat,she fell dead upon the spot  without a groan.
The Black Cat,this hideous murder accomplished  i set myself forthwith  and with entire deliberation  to the task of concealing the body.
The Black Cat,i knew that i could not remove it from the house  either by day or by night  without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.
The Black Cat,many projects entered my mind.
The Black Cat,at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments  and destroying them by fire.
The Black Cat,at another  i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar.
The Black Cat,again  i deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard about packing it in a box  as if merchandise  with the usual arrangements  and so getting a porter to take it from the house.
The Black Cat,finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than either of these.
The Black Cat,i determined to wall it up in the cellar as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.
The Black Cat,for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.
The Black Cat,its walls were loosely constructed  and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster  which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening.
The Black Cat,moreover  in one of the walls was a projection  caused by a false chimney  or fireplace  that had been filled up  and made to resemble the red of the cellar.
The Black Cat,i made no doubt that i could readily displace the bricks at this point  insert the corpse  and wall the whole up as before  so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious.
The Black Cat,and in this calculation i was not deceived.
The Black Cat,by means of a crow bar i easily dislodged the bricks  and  having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall  i propped it in that position  while  with little trouble  i re laid the whole structure as it originally stood.
The Black Cat,having procured mortar  sand  and hair  with every possible precaution  i prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old  and with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork.
The Black Cat,when i had finished  i felt satisfied that all was right.
The Black Cat,the wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed.
The Black Cat,the rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.
The Black Cat,i looked around triumphantly  and said to myself   here at least  then  my labor has not been in vain.
The Black Cat,my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness  for i had  at length  firmly resolved to put it to death.
The Black Cat,had i been able to meet with it  at the moment  there could have been no doubt of its fate  but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger  and forebore to present itself in my present mood.
The Black Cat,it is impossible to describe  or to imagine  the deep  the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom.
The Black Cat,it did not make its appearance during the night  and thus for one night at least  since its introduction into the house  i soundly and tranquilly slept  aye  slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul   the second and the third day passed  and still my tormentor came not.
The Black Cat,once again i breathed as a freeman.
The Black Cat,the monster  in terror  had fled the premises forever  i should behold it no more  my happiness was supreme  the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little.
The Black Cat,some few inquiries had been made  but these had been readily answered.
The Black Cat,even a search had been instituted but of course nothing was to be discovered.
The Black Cat,i looked upon my future felicity as secured.
The Black Cat,upon the fourth day of the assassination  a party of the police came  very unexpectedly  into the house  and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises.
The Black Cat,secure  however  in the inscrutability of my place of concealment  i felt no embarrassment whatever.
The Black Cat,the officers bade me accompany them in their search.
The Black Cat,they left no nook or corner unexplored.
The Black Cat,at length  for the third or fourth time  they descended into the cellar.
The Black Cat,i quivered not in a muscle.
The Black Cat,my heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence.
The Black Cat,i walked the cellar from end to end.
The Black Cat,i folded my arms upon my bosom  and roamed easily to and fro.
The Black Cat,the police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.
The Black Cat,the glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained.
The Black Cat,i burned to say if but one word  by way of triumph  and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.
The Black Cat,gentlemen   i said at last  as the party ascended the steps   i delight to have allayed your suspicions.
The Black Cat,i wish you all health  and a little more courtesy.
The Black Cat,by the bye  gentlemen  this this is a very well constructed house.
The Black Cat,in the rabid desire to say something easily  i scarcely knew what i uttered at all.
The Black Cat,i may say an excellently well constructed house.
The Black Cat,these walls are you going  gentlemen  these walls are solidly put together   and here  through the mere phrenzy of bravado  i rapped heavily  with a cane which i held in my hand  upon that very portion of the brick work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.
The Black Cat,but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the arch fiend  no sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence  than i was answered by a voice from within the tomb  by a cry  at first muffled and broken  like the sobbing of a child  and then quickly swelling into one long  loud  and continuous scream  utterly anomalous and inhuman a howl a wailing shriek  half of horror and half of triumph  such as might have arisen only out of hell  conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
The Black Cat,of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.
The Black Cat,swooning  i staggered to the opposite wall.
The Black Cat,for one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless  through extremity of terror and of awe.
The Black Cat,in the next  a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall.
The Black Cat,it fell bodily.
The Black Cat,the corpse  already greatly decayed and clotted with gore  stood erect before the eyes of the spectators.

The Fall of the House of Usher,a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity  for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind  and the exceeding density of the clouds  which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house  did not prevent our perceiving the life like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other  without passing away into the distance.

The Fall of the House of Usher,here is one of your favorite romances.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i will read  and you shall listen  and so we will pass away this terrible night together.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the antique volume which i had taken up was the  mad trist  of sir launcelot canning  but i had called it a favorite of usher    s more in sad jest than in earnest  for  in truth  there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.
The Fall of the House of Usher,it was  however  the only book immediately at hand  and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac  might find relief  for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies  even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read.
The Fall of the House of Usher,could i have judged  indeed  by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened  or apparently harkened  to the words of the tale  i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i had arrived at that well known portion of the story where ethelred  the hero of the trist  having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit  proceeds to make good an entrance by force.
The Fall of the House of Usher,here  it will be remembered  the words of the narrative run thus    and ethelred  who was by nature of a doughty heart  and who was now mighty withal  on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken  waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit  who  in sooth  was of an obstinate and maliceful turn  but  feeling the rain upon his shoulders  and fearing the rising of the tempest  uplifted his mace outright  and  with blows  made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand  and now pulling therewith sturdily  he so cracked  and ripped  and tore all asunder  that the noise of the dry and hollow sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.
The Fall of the House of Usher,at the termination of this sentence i started  and for a moment  paused  for it appeared to me  although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me  it appeared to me that  from some very remote portion of the mansion  there came  indistinctly  to my ears  what might have been  in its exact similarity of character  the echo  but a stifled and dull one certainly  of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described.
The Fall of the House of Usher,it was  beyond doubt  the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention  for  amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements  and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm  the sound  in itself  had nothing  surely  which should have interested or disturbed me.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i continued the story    but the good champion ethelred  now entering within the door  was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit  but  in the stead thereof  a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor  and of a fiery tongue  which sate in guard before a palace of gold  with a floor of silver  and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten   who entereth herein  a conqueror hath bin  who slayeth the dragon  the shield he shall win   and ethelred uplifted his mace  and struck upon the head of the dragon  which fell before him  and gave up his pesty breath  with a shriek so horrid and harsh  and withal so piercing  that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it  the like whereof was never before heard.
The Fall of the House of Usher,here again i paused abruptly  and now with a feeling of wild amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that  in this instance  i did actually hear  although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say  a low and apparently distant  but harsh  protracted  and most unusual screaming or grating sound the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon    s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.
The Fall of the House of Usher,oppressed  as i certainly was  upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence  by a thousand conflicting sensations  in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant  i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting  by any observation  the sensitive nervousness of my companion.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question  although  assuredly  a strange alteration had  during the last few minutes  taken place in his demeanor.
The Fall of the House of Usher,from a position fronting my own  he had gradually brought round his chair  so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber  and thus i could but partially perceive his features  although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.
The Fall of the House of Usher,his head had dropped upon his breast yet i knew that he was not asleep  from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the motion of his body  too  was at variance with this idea for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
The Fall of the House of Usher,having rapidly taken notice of all this  i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot  which thus proceeded    and now  the champion  having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon  bethinking himself of the brazen shield  and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it  removed the carcass from out of the way before him  and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall  which in sooth tarried not for his full coming  but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor  with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.
The Fall of the House of Usher,no sooner had these syllables passed my lips  than as if a shield of brass had indeed  at the moment  fallen heavily upon a floor of silver i became aware of a distinct  hollow  metallic  and clangorous  yet apparently muffled reverberation.
The Fall of the House of Usher,completely unnerved  i leaped to my feet  but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed.

The Fall of the House of Usher,bending closely over him  i at length drank in the hideous import of his words.
The Fall of the House of Usher,not hear it  yes  i hear it  and have heard it.
The Fall of the House of Usher,long long long many minutes  many hours  many days  have i heard it yet i dared not oh  pity me  miserable wretch that i am  i dared not i dared not speak  we have put her living in the tomb  said i not that my senses were acute  i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.
The Fall of the House of Usher,i heard them many  many days ago yet i dared not i dared not speak  and now to night ethelred ha  ha  the breaking of the hermit    s door  and the death cry of the dragon  and the clangor of the shield  say  rather  the rending of her coffin  and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison  and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault  oh whither shall i fly  will she not be here anon  is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste  have i not heard her footstep on the stair  do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart  madman   here he sprang furiously to his feet  and shrieked out his syllables  as if in the effort he were giving up his soul  madman  i tell you that she now stands without the door    as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell the huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed  threw slowly back  upon the instant  their ponderous and ebony jaws.

The Fall of the House of Usher,from that chamber  and from that mansion  i fled aghast.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway.
The Fall of the House of Usher,suddenly there shot along the path a wild light  and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued  for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.
The Fall of the House of Usher,the radiance was that of the full  setting  and blood red moon  which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure  of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building  in a zigzag direction  to the base.
The Fall of the House of Usher,while i gazed  this fissure rapidly widened there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the  house of usher.
Silence - A Fable,  listen to me   said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head.
Silence - A Fable,the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya  by the borders of the river zaire.

Silence - A Fable,for many miles on either side of the river    s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,they sigh one unto the other in that solitude  and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks  and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.
Silence - A Fable,and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water.
Silence - A Fable,and they sigh one unto the other.
Silence - A Fable,but there is a boundary to their realm the boundary of the dark  horrible  lofty forest.
Silence - A Fable,there  like the waves about the hebrides  the low underwood is agitated continually.
Silence - A Fable,but there is no wind throughout the heaven.
Silence - A Fable,and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound.
Silence - A Fable,and from their high summits  one by one  drop everlasting dews.
Silence - A Fable,and at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber.
Silence - A Fable,and overhead  with a rustling and loud noise  the gray clouds rush westwardly forever  until they roll  a cataract  over the fiery wall of the horizon.
Silence - A Fable,but there is no wind throughout the heaven.
Silence - A Fable,and by the shores of the river zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.
Silence - A Fable,it was night  and the rain fell  and falling  it was rain  but  having fallen  it was blood.
Silence - A Fable,and i stood in the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon my head and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.
Silence - A Fable,and  all at once  the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist  and was crimson in color.
Silence - A Fable,and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river  and was lighted by the light of the moon.
Silence - A Fable,and the rock was gray  and ghastly  and tall  and the rock was gray.
Silence - A Fable,upon its front were characters engraven in the stone  and i walked through the morass of water lilies  until i came close unto the shore  that i might read the characters upon the stone.
Silence - A Fable,but i could not decypher them.
Silence - A Fable,and i was going back into the morass  when the moon shone with a fuller red  and i turned and looked again upon the rock  and upon the characters  and the characters were desolation.
Silence - A Fable,and i looked upwards  and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock  and i hid myself among the water lilies that i might discover the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man was tall and stately in form  and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome.
Silence - A Fable,and the outlines of his figure were indistinct but his features were the features of a deity  for the mantle of the night  and of the mist  and of the moon  and of the dew  had left uncovered the features of his face.
Silence - A Fable,and his brow was lofty with thought  and his eye wild with care  and  in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow  and weariness  and disgust with mankind  and a longing after solitude.
Silence - A Fable,and the man sat upon the rock  and leaned his head upon his hand  and looked out upon the desolation.
Silence - A Fable,he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery  and up into the tall primeval trees  and up higher at the rustling heaven  and into the crimson moon.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within shelter of the lilies  and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned  and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,and the man turned his attention from the heaven  and looked out upon the dreary river zaire  and upon the yellow ghastly waters  and upon the pale legions of the water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,and the man listened to the sighs of the water lilies  and to the murmur that came up from among them.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i went down into the recesses of the morass  and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies  and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass.
Silence - A Fable,and the hippopotami heard my call  and came  with the behemoth  unto the foot of the rock  and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult  and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where  before  there had been no wind.
Silence - A Fable,and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest and the rain beat upon the head of the man and the floods of the river came down and the river was tormented into foam and the water lilies shrieked within their beds and the forest crumbled before the wind and the thunder rolled and the lightning fell and the rock rocked to its foundation.
Silence - A Fable,and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
Silence - A Fable,and the man trembled in the solitude  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
Silence - A Fable,then i grew angry and cursed  with the curse of silence  the river  and the lilies  and the wind  and the forest  and the heaven  and the thunder  and the sighs of the water lilies.
Silence - A Fable,and they became accursed  and were still.
Silence - A Fable,and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven and the thunder died away and the lightning did not flash and the clouds hung motionless and the waters sunk to their level and remained and the trees ceased to rock and the water lilies sighed no more and the murmur was heard no longer from among them  nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert.
Silence - A Fable,and i looked upon the characters of the rock  and they were changed  and the characters were silence.
Silence - A Fable,and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man  and his countenance was wan with terror.
Silence - A Fable,and  hurriedly  he raised his head from his hand  and stood forth upon the rock and listened.
Silence - A Fable,but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert  and the characters upon the rock were silence.
Silence - A Fable,and the man shuddered  and turned his face away  and fled afar off  in haste  so that i beheld him no more.
Silence - A Fable,now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi in the iron bound  melancholy volumes of the magi.
Silence - A Fable,therein  i say  are glorious histories of the heaven  and of the earth  and of the mighty sea and of the genii that over ruled the sea  and the earth  and the lofty heaven.
Silence - A Fable,there was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils  and holy  holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around dodona but  as allah liveth  that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb  i hold to be the most wonderful of all  and as the demon made an end of his story  he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed.
Silence - A Fable,and i could not laugh with the demon  and he cursed me because i could not laugh.
Silence - A Fable,and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb  came out therefrom  and lay down at the feet of the demon  and looked at him steadily in the face.

The Masque of the Red Death,it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion  and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad  that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was a voluptuous scene  that masquerade.
The Masque of the Red Death,but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were seven an imperial suite.
The Masque of the Red Death,in many palaces  however  such suites form a long and straight vista  while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand  so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.
The Masque of the Red Death,here the case was very different  as might have been expected from the duke    s love of the bizarre.
The Masque of the Red Death,the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards  and at each turn a novel effect.
The Masque of the Red Death,to the right and left  in the middle of each wall  a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite.
The Masque of the Red Death,these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened.
The Masque of the Red Death,that at the eastern extremity was hung  for example  in blue and vividly blue were its windows.
The Masque of the Red Death,the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries  and here the panes were purple.
The Masque of the Red Death,the third was green throughout  and so were the casements.
The Masque of the Red Death,the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet.
The Masque of the Red Death,the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls  falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in this chamber only  the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.
The Masque of the Red Death,the panes here were scarlet a deep blood color.
The Masque of the Red Death,now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum  amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in the corridors that followed the suite  there stood  opposite to each window  a heavy tripod  bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.
The Masque of the Red Death,and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.
The Masque of the Red Death,but in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood tinted panes  was ghastly in the extreme  and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered  that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was in this apartment  also  that there stood against the western wall  a gigantic clock of ebony.
The Masque of the Red Death,its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull  heavy  monotonous clang  and when the minute hand made the circuit of the face  and the hour was to be stricken  there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical  but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that  at each lapse of an hour  the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause  momentarily  in their performance  to hearken to the sound  and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions  and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company  and  while the chimes of the clock yet rang  it was observed that the giddiest grew pale  and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation.
The Masque of the Red Death,but when the echoes had fully ceased  a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly  the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly  and made whispering vows  each to the other  that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion  and then  after the lapse of sixty minutes  which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies   there came yet another chiming of the clock  and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.
The Masque of the Red Death,but  in spite of these things  it was a gay and magnificent revel.
The Masque of the Red Death,the tastes of the duke were peculiar.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had a fine eye for colors and effects.

The Masque of the Red Death,his followers felt that he was not.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had directed  in great part  the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers  upon occasion of this great f  te  and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.
The Masque of the Red Death,be sure they were grotesque.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm much of what has been since seen in  hernani.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.
The Masque of the Red Death,there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was much of the beautiful  much of the wanton  much of the bizarre  something of the terrible  and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.
The Masque of the Red Death,to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked  in fact  a multitude of dreams.
The Masque of the Red Death,and these the dreams writhed in and about  taking hue from the rooms  and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.
The Masque of the Red Death,and  anon  there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.
The Masque of the Red Death,and then  for a moment  all is still  and all is silent save the voice of the clock.
The Masque of the Red Death,the dreams are stiff frozen as they stand.
The Masque of the Red Death,but the echoes of the chime die away they have endured but an instant and a light  half subdued laughter floats after them as they depart.
The Masque of the Red Death,and now again the music swells  and the dreams live  and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever  taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.
The Masque of the Red Death,but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven  there are now none of the maskers who venture  for the night is waning away  and there flows a ruddier light through the blood colored panes  and the blackness of the sable drapery appals  and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet  there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.
The Masque of the Red Death,but these other apartments were densely crowded  and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the revel went whirlingly on  until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.
The Masque of the Red Death,and then the music ceased  as i have told  and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted  and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.
The Masque of the Red Death,but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock  and thus it happened  perhaps  that more of thought crept  with more of time  into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.
The Masque of the Red Death,and thus  too  it happened  perhaps  that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence  there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around  there arose at length from the whole company a buzz  or murmur  expressive of disapprobation and surprise then  finally  of terror  of horror  and of disgust.
The Masque of the Red Death,in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted  it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.
The Masque of the Red Death,in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited  but the figure in question had out heroded herod  and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince    s indefinite decorum.
The Masque of the Red Death,there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.
The Masque of the Red Death,even with the utterly lost  to whom life and death are equally jests  there are matters of which no jest can be made.
The Masque of the Red Death,the whole company  indeed  seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.
The Masque of the Red Death,the figure was tall and gaunt  and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.
The Masque of the Red Death,the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.
The Masque of the Red Death,and yet all this might have been endured  if not approved  by the mad revellers around.
The Masque of the Red Death,but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death.
The Masque of the Red Death,his vesture was dabbled in blood and his broad brow  with all the features of the face  was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.
The Masque of the Red Death,when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image  which with a slow and solemn movement  as if more fully to sustain its role  stalked to and fro among the waltzers  he was seen to be convulsed  in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste  but  in the next  his brow reddened with rage.
The Masque of the Red Death,who dares   he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him  who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery  seize him and unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise  from the battlements    it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words.
The Masque of the Red Death,they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man  and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was in the blue room where stood the prince  with a group of pale courtiers by his side.
The Masque of the Red Death,at first  as he spoke  there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder  who at the moment was also near at hand  and now  with deliberate and stately step  made closer approach to the speaker.
The Masque of the Red Death,but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party  there were found none who put forth hand to seize him  so that  unimpeded  he passed within a yard of the prince    s person  and  while the vast assembly  as if with one impulse  shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls  he made his way uninterruptedly  but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first  through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to the green through the green to the orange through this again to the white and even thence to the violet  ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him.
The Masque of the Red Death,it was then  however  that the prince prospero  maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice  rushed hurriedly through the six chambers  while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.
The Masque of the Red Death,he bore aloft a drawn dagger  and had approached  in rapid impetuosity  to within three or four feet of the retreating figure  when the latter  having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment  turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.
The Masque of the Red Death,there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet  upon which  instantly afterwards  fell prostrate in death the prince prospero.
The Masque of the Red Death,then  summoning the wild courage of despair  a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment  and  seizing the mummer  whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock  gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness  untenanted by any tangible form.
The Masque of the Red Death,and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death.
The Masque of the Red Death,he had come like a thief in the night.
The Masque of the Red Death,and one by one dropped the revellers in the blood bedewed halls of their revel  and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.
The Masque of the Red Death,and the flames of the tripods expired.
The Masque of the Red Death,and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all.
The Cask of Amontillado, the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could  but when he ventured upon insult  i vowed revenge.
The Cask of Amontillado,you  who so well know the nature of my soul  will not suppose  however  that i gave utterance to a threat.
The Cask of Amontillado,at length i would be avenged  this was a point definitively settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved  precluded the idea of risk.
The Cask of Amontillado,i must not only punish  but punish with impunity.
The Cask of Amontillado,a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.
The Cask of Amontillado,it must be understood  that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will.
The Cask of Amontillado,i continued  as was my wont  to smile in his face  and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.
The Cask of Amontillado,he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.
The Cask of Amontillado,he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.
The Cask of Amontillado,few italians have the true virtuoso spirit.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires.
The Cask of Amontillado,in painting and gemmary  fortunato  like his countrymen  was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.
The Cask of Amontillado,in this respect i did not differ from him materially  i was skilful in the italian vintages myself  and bought largely whenever i could.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was about dusk  one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season  that i encountered my friend.
The Cask of Amontillado,he accosted me with excessive warmth  for he had been drinking much.
The Cask of Amontillado,the man wore motley.
The Cask of Amontillado,he had on a tight fitting parti striped dress  and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.
The Cask of Amontillado,i was so pleased to see him  that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand.
The Cask of Amontillado,i said to him   my dear fortunato  you are luckily met.
The Cask of Amontillado,how remarkably well you are looking to day  but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado  and i have my doubts.
The Cask of Amontillado,how   said he.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado  a pipe  impossible  and in the middle of the carnival     i have my doubts   i replied   and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter.
The Cask of Amontillado,you were not to be found  and i was fearful of losing a bargain.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     i have my doubts.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     and i must satisfy them.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado     as you are engaged  i am on my way to luchesi.
The Cask of Amontillado,if any one has a critical turn  it is he.
The Cask of Amontillado,he will tell me     luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry.
The Cask of Amontillado,and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.
The Cask of Amontillado,come  let us go.
The Cask of Amontillado,whither     to your vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,my friend  no  i will not impose upon your good nature.
The Cask of Amontillado,i perceive you have an engagement.
The Cask of Amontillado,luchesi     i have no engagement  come.
The Cask of Amontillado,my friend  no.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is not the engagement  but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted.
The Cask of Amontillado,the vaults are insufferably damp.
The Cask of Amontillado,they are encrusted with nitre.
The Cask of Amontillado,let us go  nevertheless.
The Cask of Amontillado,the cold is merely nothing.
The Cask of Amontillado,amontillado  you have been imposed upon.
The Cask of Amontillado,and as for luchesi  he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,thus speaking  fortunato possessed himself of my arm.
The Cask of Amontillado,putting on a mask of black silk  and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person  i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
The Cask of Amontillado,there were no attendants at home  they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had told them that i should not return until the morning  and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.
The Cask of Amontillado,these orders were sufficient  i well knew  to insure their immediate disappearance  one and all  as soon as my back was turned.
The Cask of Amontillado,i took from their sconces two flambeaux  and giving one to fortunato  bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,i passed down a long and winding staircase  requesting him to be cautious as he followed.
The Cask of Amontillado,we came at length to the foot of the descent  and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors.
The Cask of Amontillado,the gait of my friend was unsteady  and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.
The Cask of Amontillado,the pipe   said he.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is farther on   said i   but observe the white web work which gleams from these cavern walls.
The Cask of Amontillado,he turned towards me  and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.
The Cask of Amontillado,nitre   he asked  at length.
The Cask of Amontillado,nitre   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,how long have you had that cough     ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh  ugh    my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is nothing   he said  at last.
The Cask of Amontillado,come   i said  with decision   we will go back  your health is precious.
The Cask of Amontillado,you are rich  respected  admired  beloved  you are happy  as once i was.
The Cask of Amontillado,you are a man to be missed.
The Cask of Amontillado,for me it is no matter.
The Cask of Amontillado,we will go back  you will be ill  and i cannot be responsible.
The Cask of Amontillado,besides  there is luchesi     enough   he said   the cough is a mere nothing  it will not kill me.
The Cask of Amontillado,i shall not die of a cough.
The Cask of Amontillado,true true   i replied   and  indeed  i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution.
The Cask of Amontillado,a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps.
The Cask of Amontillado,here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.
The Cask of Amontillado,drink   i said  presenting him the wine.
The Cask of Amontillado,he raised it to his lips with a leer.
The Cask of Amontillado,he paused and nodded to me familiarly  while his bells jingled.
The Cask of Amontillado,i drink   he said   to the buried that repose around us.
The Cask of Amontillado,and i to your long life.
The Cask of Amontillado,he again took my arm  and we proceeded.
The Cask of Amontillado,these vaults   he said   are extensive.
The Cask of Amontillado,the montresors   i replied   were a great and numerous family.
The Cask of Amontillado,i forget your arms.
The Cask of Amontillado,a huge human foot d    or  in a field azure  the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.
The Cask of Amontillado,and the motto     nemo me impune lacessit.
The Cask of Amontillado,good   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.
The Cask of Amontillado,my own fancy grew warm with the medoc.
The Cask of Amontillado,we had passed through walls of piled bones  with casks and puncheons intermingling  into the inmost recesses of the catacombs.
The Cask of Amontillado,i paused again  and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow.
The Cask of Amontillado,the nitre   i said   see  it increases.
The Cask of Amontillado,it hangs like moss upon the vaults.
The Cask of Amontillado,we are below the river    s bed.
The Cask of Amontillado,the drops of moisture trickle among the bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,come  we will go back ere it is too late.
The Cask of Amontillado,your cough     it is nothing   he said   let us go on.
The Cask of Amontillado,but first  another draught of the medoc.
The Cask of Amontillado,i broke and reached him a flagon of de gr  ve.
The Cask of Amontillado,he emptied it at a breath.
The Cask of Amontillado,his eyes flashed with a fierce light.
The Cask of Amontillado,he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand.
The Cask of Amontillado,i looked at him in surprise.
The Cask of Amontillado,he repeated the movement a grotesque one.
The Cask of Amontillado,you do not comprehend   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,not i   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,then you are not of the brotherhood.
The Cask of Amontillado,how     you are not of the masons.
The Cask of Amontillado,yes  yes   i said   yes  yes.
The Cask of Amontillado,you  impossible  a mason     a mason   i replied.
The Cask of Amontillado,a sign   he said.
The Cask of Amontillado,it is this   i answered  producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire.
The Cask of Amontillado,you jest   he exclaimed  recoiling a few paces.
The Cask of Amontillado,but let us proceed to the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,be it so   i said  replacing the tool beneath the cloak  and again offering him my arm.
The Cask of Amontillado,he leaned upon it heavily.
The Cask of Amontillado,we continued our route in search of the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,we passed through a range of low arches  descended  passed on  and descending again  arrived at a deep crypt  in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.
The Cask of Amontillado,at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.
The Cask of Amontillado,its walls had been lined with human remains  piled to the vault overhead  in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris.
The Cask of Amontillado,three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.
The Cask of Amontillado,from the fourth the bones had been thrown down  and lay promiscuously upon the earth  forming at one point a mound of some size.
The Cask of Amontillado,within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones  we perceived a still interior recess  in depth about four feet  in width three  in height six or seven.
The Cask of Amontillado,it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself  but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs  and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was in vain that fortunato  uplifting his dull torch  endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.
The Cask of Amontillado,proceed   i said   herein is the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,as for luchesi     he is an ignoramus   interrupted my friend  as he stepped unsteadily forward  while i followed immediately at his heels.
The Cask of Amontillado,in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche  and finding his progress arrested by the rock  stood stupidly bewildered.
The Cask of Amontillado,a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite.
The Cask of Amontillado,in its surface were two iron staples  distant from each other about two feet  horizontally.
The Cask of Amontillado,from one of these depended a short chain  from the other a padlock.
The Cask of Amontillado,throwing the links about his waist  it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.
The Cask of Amontillado,he was too much astounded to resist.
The Cask of Amontillado,withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,pass your hand   i said   over the wall  you cannot help feeling the nitre.
The Cask of Amontillado,indeed it is very damp.
The Cask of Amontillado,once more let me implore you to return.
The Cask of Amontillado,no  then i must positively leave you.
The Cask of Amontillado,but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power.
The Cask of Amontillado,the amontillado   ejaculated my friend  not yet recovered from his astonishment.
The Cask of Amontillado,true   i replied   the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken.
The Cask of Amontillado,throwing them aside  i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.
The Cask of Amontillado,with these materials and with the aid of my trowel  i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off.
The Cask of Amontillado,the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was not the cry of a drunken man.
The Cask of Amontillado,there was then a long and obstinate silence.
The Cask of Amontillado,i laid the second tier  and the third  and the fourth  and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain.
The Cask of Amontillado,the noise lasted for several minutes  during which  that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction  i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,when at last the clanking subsided  i resumed the trowel  and finished without interruption the fifth  the sixth  and the seventh tier.
The Cask of Amontillado,the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.
The Cask of Amontillado,i again paused  and holding the flambeaux over the mason work  threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.
The Cask of Amontillado,a succession of loud and shrill screams  bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form  seemed to thrust me violently back.
The Cask of Amontillado,for a brief moment i hesitated i trembled.
The Cask of Amontillado,unsheathing my rapier  i began to grope with it about the recess  but the thought of an instant reassured me.
The Cask of Amontillado,i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs  and felt satisfied.
The Cask of Amontillado,i reapproached the wall.
The Cask of Amontillado,i replied to the yells of him who clamored.
The Cask of Amontillado,i re echoed i aided i surpassed them in volume and in strength.
The Cask of Amontillado,i did this  and the clamorer grew still.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was now midnight  and my task was drawing to a close.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had completed the eighth  the ninth  and the tenth tier.
The Cask of Amontillado,i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh  there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.
The Cask of Amontillado,i struggled with its weight  i placed it partially in its destined position.
The Cask of Amontillado,but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.
The Cask of Amontillado,it was succeeded by a sad voice  which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato.
The Cask of Amontillado,the voice said    ha  ha  ha  he  he  a very good joke indeed an excellent jest.
The Cask of Amontillado,we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo he  he  he  over our wine he  he  he     the amontillado   i said.
The Cask of Amontillado,he  he  he  he  he  he  yes  the amontillado.
The Cask of Amontillado,but is it not getting late  will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo  the lady fortunato and the rest  let us be gone.
The Cask of Amontillado,yes   i said   let us be gone.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the love of god  montressor     yes   i said   for the love of god    but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply.
The Cask of Amontillado,i grew impatient.
The Cask of Amontillado,i called aloud    fortunato    no answer.
The Cask of Amontillado,i called again    fortunato    no answer still.
The Cask of Amontillado,i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within.
The Cask of Amontillado,there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.
The Cask of Amontillado,my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.
The Cask of Amontillado,i hastened to make an end of my labor.
The Cask of Amontillado,i forced the last stone into its position  i plastered it up.
The Cask of Amontillado,against the new masonry i re erected the old rampart of bones.
The Cask of Amontillado,for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.
The Cask of Amontillado,in pace requiescat
The Island of the Way,  la musique   says marmontel  in those  contes moraux       which in all our translations  we have insisted upon calling  moral tales   as if in mockery of their spirit  la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui m  me  tous les autres veulent des temoins.
The Island of the Way,he here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.
The Island of the Way,no more than any other talent  is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment  where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise.
The Island of the Way,and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude.
The Island of the Way,the idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly  or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point  is  doubtless  the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone.
The Island of the Way,the proposition  in this form  will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake  and for its spiritual uses.
The Island of the Way,but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion.
The Island of the Way,i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery.
The Island of the Way,in truth  the man who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude behold that glory.
The Island of the Way,to me  at least  the presence not of human life only  but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless is a stain upon the landscape is at war with the genius of the scene.
The Island of the Way,i love  indeed  to regard the dark valleys  and the gray rocks  and the waters that silently smile  and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers  and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all  i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole a whole whose form  that of the sphere  is the most perfect and most inclusive of all  whose path is among associate planets  whose meek handmaiden is the moon  whose mediate sovereign is the sun  whose life is eternity  whose thought is that of a god  whose enjoyment is knowledge  whose destinies are lost in immensity  whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain a being which we  in consequence  regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.
The Island of the Way,our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood that space  and therefore that bulk  is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty.
The Island of the Way,the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution  without collision  of the greatest possible number of bodies.
The Island of the Way,the forms of those bodies are accurately such as  within a given surface  to include the greatest possible amount of matter  while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.
The Island of the Way,nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god  that space itself is infinite  for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it.
The Island of the Way,and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle indeed  as far as our judgments extend  the leading principle in the operations of deity  it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute  where we daily trace it  and not extending to those of the august.
The Island of the Way,as we find cycle within cycle without end  yet all revolving around one far distant centre which is the god head  may we not analogically suppose in the same manner  life within life  the less within the greater  and all within the spirit divine  in short  we are madly erring  through self esteem  in believing man  in either his temporal or future destinies  to be of more moment in the universe than that vast  clod of the valley  which he tills and contemns  and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.
The Island of the Way,these fancies  and such as these  have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests  by the rivers and the ocean  a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic.
The Island of the Way,my wanderings amid such scenes have been many  and far searching  and often solitary  and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim  deep valley  or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake  has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed alone.
The Island of the Way,what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion to the well known work of zimmerman  that   la solitude est une belle chose  mais il faut quelqu    un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose   the epigram cannot be gainsayed  but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.
The Island of the Way,it was during one of my lonely journeyings  amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain  and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island.
The Island of the Way,i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june  and threw myself upon the turf  beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub  that i might doze as i contemplated the scene.
The Island of the Way,i felt that thus only should i look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore.
The Island of the Way,on all sides save to the west  where the sun was about sinking arose the verdant walls of the forest.
The Island of the Way,the little river which turned sharply in its course  and was thus immediately lost to sight  seemed to have no exit from its prison  but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter  so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward  there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley  a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.
The Island of the Way,about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in  one small circular island  profusely verdured  reposed upon the bosom of the stream.
The Island of the Way,so blended bank and shadow there that each seemed pendulous in air   so mirror like was the glassy water  that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began.
The Island of the Way,my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet  and i observed a singularly marked difference in their aspects.
The Island of the Way,the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties.
The Island of the Way,it glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight  and fairly laughed with flowers.
The Island of the Way,the grass was short  springy  sweet scented  and asphodel interspersed.
The Island of the Way,the trees were lithe  mirthful  erect bright  slender  and graceful  of eastern figure and foliage  with bark smooth  glossy  and parti colored.
The Island of the Way,there seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all  and although no airs blew from out the heavens  yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies  that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.
The Island of the Way,the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.
The Island of the Way,a sombre  yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.
The Island of the Way,the trees were dark in color  and mournful in form and attitude  wreathing themselves into sad  solemn  and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.
The Island of the Way,the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress  and the heads of its blades hung droopingly  and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks  low and narrow  and not very long  that had the aspect of graves  but were not  although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.
The Island of the Way,the shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water  and seemed to bury itself therein  impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.
The Island of the Way,i fancied that each shadow  as the sun descended lower and lower  separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth  and thus became absorbed by the stream  while other shadows issued momently from the trees  taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.
The Island of the Way,this idea  having once seized upon my fancy  greatly excited it  and i lost myself forthwith in revery.
The Island of the Way,if ever island were enchanted   said i to myself   this is it.
The Island of the Way,this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck of the race.
The Island of the Way,are these green tombs theirs  or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own  in dying  do they not rather waste away mournfully  rendering unto god  little by little  their existence  as these trees render up shadow after shadow  exhausting their substance unto dissolution  what the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade  growing thus blacker by what it preys upon  may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it    as i thus mused  with half shut eyes  while the sun sank rapidly to rest  and eddying currents careered round and round the island  bearing upon their bosom large  dazzling  white flakes of the bark of the sycamore flakes which  in their multiform positions upon the water  a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i thus mused  it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays about whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.
The Island of the Way,she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe  and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.
The Island of the Way,while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams  her attitude seemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade.
The Island of the Way,slowly she glided along  and at length rounded the islet and re entered the region of light.
The Island of the Way,the revolution which has just been made by the fay   continued i  musingly   is the cycle of the brief year of her life.
The Island of the Way,she has floated through her winter and through her summer.
The Island of the Way,she is a year nearer unto death  for i did not fail to see that  as she came into the shade  her shadow fell from her  and was swallowed up in the dark water  making its blackness more black.
The Island of the Way,and again the boat appeared and the fay  but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.
The Island of the Way,she floated again from out the light and into the gloom  which deepened momently  and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water  and became absorbed into its blackness.
The Island of the Way,and again and again she made the circuit of the island   while the sun rushed down to his slumbers   and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person  while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct  and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade  which became whelmed in a shadow more black.
The Island of the Way,but at length when the sun had utterly departed  the fay  now the mere ghost of her former self  went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and that she issued thence at all i cannot say  for darkness fell over all things and i beheld her magical figure no more.
The Assignation, ill fated and mysterious man  bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination  and fallen in the flames of thine own youth  again in fancy i behold thee  once more thy form hath risen before me  not oh  not as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions  thine own venice which is a star beloved elysium of the sea  and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters.
The Assignation,yes  i repeat it as thou shouldst be.
The Assignation,there are surely other worlds than this other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude other speculations than the speculations of the sophist.
The Assignation,who then shall call thy conduct into question  who blame thee for thy visionary hours  or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life  which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies   it was at venice  beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di sospiri  that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom i speak.
The Assignation,it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting.
The Assignation,yet i remember ah  how should i forget  the deep midnight  the bridge of sighs  the beauty of woman  and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.
The Assignation,it was a night of unusual gloom.
The Assignation,the great clock of the piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening.
The Assignation,the square of the campanile lay silent and deserted  and the lights in the old ducal palace were dying fast away.
The Assignation,i was returning home from the piazetta  by way of the grand canal.
The Assignation,but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal san marco  a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night  in one wild  hysterical  and long continued shriek.
The Assignation,startled at the sound  i sprang upon my feet  while the gondolier  letting slip his single oar  lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery  and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.
The Assignation,like some huge and sable feathered condor  we were slowly drifting down towards the bridge of sighs  when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows  and down the staircases of the ducal palace  turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.
The Assignation,a child  slipping from the arms of its own mother  had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal.
The Assignation,the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim  and  although my own gondola was the only one in sight  many a stout swimmer  already in the stream  was seeking in vain upon the surface  the treasure which was to be found  alas  only within the abyss.
The Assignation,upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace  and a few steps above the water  stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten.
The Assignation,it was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration of all venice the gayest of the gay the most lovely where all were beautiful but still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni  and the mother of that fair child  her first and only one  who now  deep beneath the murky water  was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses  and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name.
The Assignation,she stood alone.
The Assignation,her small  bare  and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of marble beneath her.
The Assignation,her hair  not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ball room array  clustered  amid a shower of diamonds  round and round her classical head  in curls like those of the young hyacinth.
The Assignation,a snowy white and gauze like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form  but the mid summer and midnight air was hot  sullen  and still  and no motion in the statue like form itself  stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe.
The Assignation,yet strange to say  her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted in a widely different direction  the prison of the old republic is  i think  the stateliest building in all venice but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it  when beneath her lay stifling her only child  yon dark  gloomy niche  too  yawns right opposite her chamber window what  then  could there be in its shadows in its architecture in its ivy wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa di mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before  nonsense  who does not remember that  at such a time as this  the eye  like a shattered mirror  multiplies the images of its sorrow  and sees in innumerable far off places  the woe which is close at hand   many steps above the marchesa  and within the arch of the water gate  stood  in full dress  the satyr like figure of mentoni himself.
The Assignation,he was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar  and seemed ennuye to the very death  as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his child.
The Assignation,stupefied and aghast  i had myself no power to move from the upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek  and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance  as with pale countenance and rigid limbs  i floated down among them in that funereal gondola.
The Assignation,all efforts proved in vain.
The Assignation,many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing their exertions  and yielding to a gloomy sorrow.
The Assignation,there seemed but little hope for the child   how much less than for the mother   but now  from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison  and as fronting the lattice of the marchesa  a figure muffled in a cloak  stepped out within reach of the light  and  pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy descent  plunged headlong into the canal.
The Assignation,as  in an instant afterwards  he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp  upon the marble flagstones by the side of the marchesa  his cloak  heavy with the drenching water  became unfastened  and  falling in folds about his feet  discovered to the wonder stricken spectators the graceful person of a very young man  with the sound of whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing.
The Assignation,no word spoke the deliverer.
The Assignation,but the marchesa  she will now receive her child she will press it to her heart she will cling to its little form  and smother it with her caresses.
The Assignation,alas  another    s arms have taken it from the stranger another    s arms have taken it away  and borne it afar off  unnoticed  into the palace  and the marchesa  her lip her beautiful lip trembles  tears are gathering in her eyes those eyes which  like pliny    s acanthus  are  soft and almost liquid.
The Assignation,yes  tears are gathering in those eyes and see  the entire woman thrills throughout the soul  and the statue has started into life  the pallor of the marble countenance  the swelling of the marble bosom  the very purity of the marble feet  we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson  and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame  as a gentle air at napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass.
The Assignation,why should that lady blush  to this demand there is no answer except that  having left  in the eager haste and terror of a mother    s heart  the privacy of her own boudoir  she has neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers  and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due.
The Assignation,what other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing  for the glance of those wild appealing eyes  for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom  for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand  that hand which fell  as mentoni turned into the palace  accidentally  upon the hand of the stranger.
The Assignation,what reason could there have been for the low the singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu   thou hast conquered   she said  or the murmurs of the water deceived me   thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise we shall meet so let it be    the tumult had subsided  the lights had died away within the palace  and the stranger  whom i now recognized  stood alone upon the flags.
The Assignation,he shook with inconceivable agitation  and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola.
The Assignation,i could not do less than offer him the service of my own  and he accepted the civility.
The Assignation,having obtained an oar at the water gate  we proceeded together to his residence  while he rapidly recovered his self possession  and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality.
The Assignation,there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being minute.
The Assignation,the person of the stranger let me call him by this title  who to all the world was still a stranger the person of the stranger is one of these subjects.
The Assignation,in height he might have been below rather than above the medium size  although there were moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and belied the assertion.
The Assignation,the light  almost slender symmetry of his figure  promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at the bridge of sighs  than of that herculean strength which he has been known to wield without an effort  upon occasions of more dangerous emergency.
The Assignation,with the mouth and chin of a deity singular  wild  full  liquid eyes  whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jet and a profusion of curling  black hair  from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivory his were features than which i have seen none more classically regular  except  perhaps  the marble ones of the emperor commodus.
The Assignation,yet his countenance was  nevertheless  one of those which all men have seen at some period of their lives  and have never afterwards seen again.
The Assignation,it had no peculiar  it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory  a countenance seen and instantly forgotten  but forgotten with a vague and never ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.
The Assignation,not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed  at any time  to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face but that the mirror  mirror like  retained no vestige of the passion  when the passion had departed.
The Assignation,upon leaving him on the night of our adventure  he solicited me  in what i thought an urgent manner  to call upon him very early the next morning.
The Assignation,shortly after sunrise  i found myself accordingly at his palazzo  one of those huge structures of gloomy  yet fantastic pomp  which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the rialto.
The Assignation,i was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics  into an apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare  making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.
The Assignation,i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy.
The Assignation,report had spoken of his possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous exaggeration.
The Assignation,but as i gazed about me  i could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.
The Assignation,although  as i say  the sun had arisen  yet the room was still brilliantly lighted up.
The Assignation,i judge from this circumstance  as well as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend  that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night.
The Assignation,in the architecture and embellishments of the chamber  the evident design had been to dazzle and astound.
The Assignation,little attention had been paid to the decora of what is technically called keeping  or to the proprieties of nationality.
The Assignation,the eye wandered from object to object  and rested upon none neither the grotesques of the greek painters  nor the sculptures of the best italian days  nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt.
The Assignation,rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low  melancholy music  whose origin was not to be discovered.
The Assignation,the senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes  reeking up from strange convolute censers  together with multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire.
The Assignation,the rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole  through windows  formed each of a single pane of crimson tinted glass.
The Assignation,glancing to and fro  in a thousand reflections  from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver  the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the artificial light  and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich  liquid looking cloth of chili gold.
The Assignation,ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  ha   laughed the proprietor  motioning me to a seat as i entered the room  and throwing himself back at full length upon an ottoman.
The Assignation,i see   said he  perceiving that i could not immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a welcome  i see you are astonished at my apartment at my statues my pictures my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery  absolutely drunk  eh  with my magnificence  but pardon me  my dear sir   here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality   pardon me for my uncharitable laughter.
The Assignation,you appeared so utterly astonished.
The Assignation,besides  some things are so completely ludicrous  that a man must laugh or die.
The Assignation,to die laughing  must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths  sir thomas more a very fine man was sir thomas more sir thomas more died laughing  you remember.
The Assignation,also in the absurdities of ravisius textor  there is a long list of characters who came to the same magnificent end.
The Assignation,do you know  however   continued he musingly   that at sparta  which is now pal  ochori   at sparta  i say  to the west of the citadel  among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins  is a kind of socle  upon which are still legible the letters         .
The Assignation,they are undoubtedly part of               .
The Assignation,now  at sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities.
The Assignation,how exceedingly strange that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others  but in the present instance   he resumed  with a singular alteration of voice and manner   i have no right to be merry at your expense.
The Assignation,you might well have been amazed.
The Assignation,europe cannot produce anything so fine as this  my little regal cabinet.
The Assignation,my other apartments are by no means of the same order mere ultras of fashionable insipidity.
The Assignation,this is better than fashion is it not  yet this has but to be seen to become the rage that is  with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.
The Assignation,i have guarded  however  against any such profanation.
The Assignation,with one exception  you are the only human being besides myself and my valet  who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts  since they have been bedizened as you see    i bowed in acknowledgment for the overpowering sense of splendor and perfume  and music  together with the unexpected eccentricity of his address and manner  prevented me from expressing  in words  my appreciation of what i might have construed into a compliment.
The Assignation,here   he resumed  arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around the apartment   here are paintings from the greeks to cimabue  and from cimabue to the present hour.
The Assignation,many are chosen  as you see  with little deference to the opinions of virtu.
The Assignation,they are all  however  fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this.
The Assignation,here  too  are some chefs d    oeuvre of the unknown great  and here  unfinished designs by men  celebrated in their day  whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence and to me.
The Assignation,what think you   said he  turning abruptly as he spoke  what think you of this madonna della pieta     it is guido    s own   i said  with all the enthusiasm of my nature  for i had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness.
The Assignation,it is guido    s own  how could you have obtained it  she is undoubtedly in painting what the venus is in sculpture.
The Assignation,ha   said he thoughtfully   the venus the beautiful venus  the venus of the medici  she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair  part of the left arm  here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty   and all the right  are restorations  and in the coquetry of that right arm lies  i think  the quintessence of all affectation.
The Assignation,give me the canova  the apollo  too  is a copy there can be no doubt of it blind fool that i am  who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo  i cannot help pity me  i cannot help preferring the antinous.
The Assignation,was it not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of marble  then michael angelo was by no means original in his couplet       non ha l    ottimo artista alcun concetto che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.
The Assignation,it has been  or should be remarked  that  in the manner of the true gentleman  we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the vulgar  without being at once precisely able to determine in what such difference consists.
The Assignation,allowing the remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance  i felt it  on that eventful morning  still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and character.
The Assignation,nor can i better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings  than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought  pervading even his most trivial actions intruding upon his moments of dalliance and interweaving itself with his very flashes of merriment like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis.
The Assignation,i could not help  however  repeatedly observing  through the mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of little importance  a certain air of trepidation a degree of nervous unction in action and in speech an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable  and upon some occasions even filled me with alarm.
The Assignation,frequently  too  pausing in the middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten  he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention  as if either in momentary expectation of a visitor  or to sounds which must have had existence in his imagination alone.
The Assignation,it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction  that  in turning over a page of the poet and scholar politian    s beautiful tragedy  the orfeo    the first native italian tragedy   which lay near me upon an ottoman  i discovered a passage underlined in pencil.
The Assignation,it was a passage towards the end of the third act a passage of the most heart stirring excitement a passage which  although tainted with impurity  no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion no woman without a sigh.
The Assignation,the whole page was blotted with fresh tears  and  upon the opposite interleaf  were the following english lines  written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance  that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his own    thou wast that all to me  love      for which my soul did pine  a green isle in the sea  love      a fountain and a shrine  all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers      and all the flowers were mine.
The Assignation,ah  dream too bright to last      ah  starry hope  that didst arise but to be overcast      a voice from out the future cries   onward   but o    er the past      dim gulf   my spirit hovering lies  mute motionless aghast   for alas  alas  with me     the light of life is o    er.
The Assignation,no more no more no more        such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore       shall bloom the thunder blasted tree  or the stricken eagle soar   now all my hours are trances      and all my nightly dreams are where the dark eye glances      and where thy footstep gleams  in what ethereal dances      by what italian streams.
The Assignation,alas  for that accursed time     they bore thee o    er the billow  from love to titled age and crime      and an unholy pillow   from me  and from our misty clime      where weeps the silver willow   that these lines were written in english a language with which i had not believed their author acquainted afforded me little matter for surprise.
The Assignation,i was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements  and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation  to be astonished at any similar discovery  but the place of date  i must confess  occasioned me no little amazement.
The Assignation,it had been originally written london  and afterwards carefully overscored not  however  so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye.
The Assignation,i say  this occasioned me no little amazement  for i well remember that  in a former conversation with a friend  i particularly inquired if he had at any time met in london the marchesa di mentoni   who for some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city   when his answer  if i mistake not  gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of great britain.
The Assignation,i might as well here mention  that i have more than once heard   without  of course  giving credit to a report involving so many improbabilities   that the person of whom i speak  was not only by birth  but in education  an englishman.
The Assignation,there is one painting   said he  without being aware of my notice of the tragedy  there is still one painting which you have not seen.
The Assignation,and throwing aside a drapery  he discovered a full length portrait of the marchesa aphrodite.
The Assignation,human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty.
The Assignation,the same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace  stood before me once again.
The Assignation,but in the expression of the countenance  which was beaming all over with smiles  there still lurked  incomprehensible anomaly   that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful.
The Assignation,her right arm lay folded over her bosom.
The Assignation,with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.
The Assignation,one small  fairy foot  alone visible  barely touched the earth  and  scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness  floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings.
The Assignation,my glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend  and the vigorous words of chapman    s bussy d    ambois  quivered instinctively upon my lips        he is up there like a roman statue  he will stand till death hath made him marble     come   he said at length  turning towards a table of richly enamelled and massive silver  upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained  together with two large etruscan vases  fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait  and filled with what i supposed to be johannisberger.
The Assignation,come   he said  abruptly   let us drink  it is early but let us drink.
The Assignation,it is indeed early   he continued  musingly  as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise   it is indeed early but what matters it  let us drink  let us pour out an offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to subdue   and  having made me pledge him in a bumper  he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.
The Assignation,to dream   he continued  resuming the tone of his desultory conversation  as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vases  to dream has been the business of my life.
The Assignation,i have therefore framed for myself  as you see  a bower of dreams.
The Assignation,in the heart of venice could i have erected a better  you behold around you  it is true  a medley of architectural embellishments.
The Assignation,the chastity of ionia is offended by antediluvian devices  and the sphynxes of egypt are outstretched upon carpets of gold.
The Assignation,yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.
The Assignation,proprieties of place  and especially of time  are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.
The Assignation,once i was myself a decorist  but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul.
The Assignation,all this is now the fitter for my purpose.
The Assignation,like these arabesque censers  my spirit is writhing in fire  and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither i am now rapidly departing.
The Assignation,he here paused abruptly  bent his head to his bosom  and seemed to listen to a sound which i could not hear.
The Assignation,at length  erecting his frame  he looked upwards  and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of chichester    stay for me there  i will not fail to meet thee in that hollow vale.
The Assignation,in the next instant  confessing the power of the wine  he threw himself at full length upon an ottoman.
The Assignation,a quick step was now heard upon the staircase  and a loud knock at the door rapidly succeeded.
The Assignation,i was hastening to anticipate a second disturbance  when a page of mentoni    s household burst into the room  and faltered out  in a voice choking with emotion  the incoherent words   my mistress  my mistress  poisoned  poisoned  oh  beautiful oh  beautiful aphrodite    bewildered  i flew to the ottoman  and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence.
The Assignation,but his limbs were rigid his lips were livid his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death.
The Assignation,i staggered back towards the table my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.
The Pit and the Pendulum, i was sick sick unto death with that long agony  and when they at length unbound me  and i was permitted to sit  i felt that my senses were leaving me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sentence the dread sentence of death was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears.
The Pit and the Pendulum,after that  the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this only for a brief period  for presently i heard no more.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet  for a while  i saw but with how terrible an exaggeration  i saw the lips of the black robed judges.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they appeared to me white whiter than the sheet upon which i trace these words and thin even to grotesqueness  thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness of immoveable resolution of stern contempt of human torture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that the decrees of what to me was fate  were still issuing from those lips.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw them writhe with a deadly locution.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw them fashion the syllables of my name  and i shuddered because no sound succeeded.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw  too  for a few moments of delirious horror  the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first they wore the aspect of charity  and seemed white and slender angels who would save me  but then  all at once  there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit  and i felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery  while the angel forms became meaningless spectres  with heads of flame  and i saw that from them there would be no help.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then there stole into my fancy  like a rich musical note  the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the thought came gently and stealthily  and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation  but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it  the figures of the judges vanished  as if magically  from before me  the tall candles sank into nothingness  their flames went out utterly  the blackness of darkness supervened  all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then silence  and stillness  night were the universe.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had swooned  but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what of it there remained i will not attempt to define  or even to describe  yet all was not lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the deepest slumber no  in delirium no  in a swoon no  in death no  even in the grave all is not lost.
The Pit and the Pendulum,else there is no immortality for man.
The Pit and the Pendulum,arousing from the most profound of slumbers  we break the gossamer web of some dream.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet in a second afterward   so frail may that web have been  we remember not that we have dreamed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the return to life from the swoon there are two stages  first  that of the sense of mental or spiritual  secondly  that of the sense of physical  existence.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it seems probable that if  upon reaching the second stage  we could recall the impressions of the first  we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and that gulf is what  how at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb  but if the impressions of what i have termed the first stage are not  at will  recalled  yet  after long interval  do they not come unbidden  while we marvel whence they come  he who has never swooned  is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow  is not he who beholds floating in mid air the sad visions that the many may not view  is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower  is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember  amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed  there have been moments when i have dreamed of success  there have been brief  very brief periods when i have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,these shadows of memory tell  indistinctly  of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down down still down till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they tell also of a vague horror at my heart  on account of that heart    s unnatural stillness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things  as if those who bore me  a ghastly train   had outrun  in their descent  the limits of the limitless  and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.
The Pit and the Pendulum,after this i call to mind flatness and dampness  and then all is madness the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.
The Pit and the Pendulum,very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound the tumultuous motion of the heart  and  in my ears  the sound of its beating.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a pause in which all is blank.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then again sound  and motion  and touch a tingling sensation pervading my frame.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then the mere consciousness of existence  without thought a condition which lasted long.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then  very suddenly  thought  and shuddering terror  and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and now a full memory of the trial  of the judges  of the sable draperies  of the sentence  of the sickness  of the swoon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,then entire forgetfulness of all that followed  of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,so far  i had not opened my eyes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt that i lay upon my back  unbound.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i reached out my hand  and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there i suffered it to remain for many minutes  while i strove to imagine where and what i could be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i longed  yet dared not to employ my vision.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dreaded the first glance at objects around me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was not that i feared to look upon things horrible  but that i grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length  with a wild desperation at heart  i quickly unclosed my eyes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my worst thoughts  then  were confirmed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the blackness of eternal night encompassed me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i struggled for breath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the atmosphere was intolerably close.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i still lay quietly  and made effort to exercise my reason.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings  and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sentence had passed  and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead.
The Pit and the Pendulum,such a supposition  notwithstanding what we read in fiction  is altogether inconsistent with real existence  but where and in what state was i  the condemned to death  i knew  perished usually at the autos da fe  and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial.
The Pit and the Pendulum,had i been remanded to my dungeon  to await the next sacrifice  which would not take place for many months  this i at once saw could not be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,victims had been in immediate demand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,moreover  my dungeon  as well as all the condemned cells at toledo  had stone floors  and light was not altogether excluded.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart  and for a brief period  i once more relapsed into insensibility.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon recovering  i at once started to my feet  trembling convulsively in every fibre.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt nothing  yet dreaded to move a step  lest i should be impeded by the walls of a tomb.
The Pit and the Pendulum,perspiration burst from every pore  and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the agony of suspense grew at length intolerable  and i cautiously moved forward  with my arms extended  and my eyes straining from their sockets  in the hope of catching some faint ray of light.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i proceeded for many paces  but still all was blackness and vacancy.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i breathed more freely.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it seemed evident that mine was not  at least  the most hideous of fates.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and now  as i still continued to step cautiously onward  there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of toledo.
The Pit and the Pendulum,of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated fables i had always deemed them but yet strange  and too ghastly to repeat  save in a whisper.
The Pit and the Pendulum,was i left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness  or what fate  perhaps even more fearful  awaited me  that the result would be death  and a death of more than customary bitterness  i knew too well the character of my judges to doubt.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was a wall  seemingly of stone masonry very smooth  slimy  and cold.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i followed it up  stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this process  however  afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon  as i might make its circuit  and return to the point whence i set out  without being aware of the fact  so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket  when led into the inquisitorial chamber  but it was gone  my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry  so as to identify my point of departure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the difficulty  nevertheless  was but trivial  although  in the disorder of my fancy  it seemed at first insuperable.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length  and at right angles to the wall.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in groping my way around the prison  i could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit.
The Pit and the Pendulum,so  at least i thought  but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon  or upon my own weakness.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the ground was moist and slippery.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i staggered onward for some time  when i stumbled and fell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate  and sleep soon overtook me as i lay.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon awaking  and stretching forth an arm  i found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance  but ate and drank with avidity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,shortly afterward  i resumed my tour around the prison  and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,up to the period when i fell i had counted fifty two paces  and upon resuming my walk  i had counted forty eight more when i arrived at the rag.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there were in all  then  a hundred paces  and  admitting two paces to the yard  i presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had met  however  with many angles in the wall  and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault  for vault i could not help supposing it to be.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had little object certainly no hope in these researches  but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them.
The Pit and the Pendulum,quitting the wall  i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first i proceeded with extreme caution  for the floor  although seemingly of solid material  was treacherous with slime.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length  however  i took courage  and did not hesitate to step firmly  endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner  when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i stepped on it  and fell violently on my face.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the confusion attending my fall  i did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance  which yet  in a few seconds afterward  and while i still lay prostrate  arrested my attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was this  my chin rested upon the floor of the prison  but my lips and the upper portion of my head  although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin  touched nothing.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor  and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i put forward my arm  and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit  whose extent  of course  i had no means of ascertaining at the moment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,groping about the masonry just below the margin  i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment  and let it fall into the abyss.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent  at length there was a sullen plunge into water  succeeded by loud echoes.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening  and as rapid closing of a door overhead  while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom  and as suddenly faded away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me  and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped.
The Pit and the Pendulum,another step before my fall  and the world had seen me no more.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and the death just avoided  was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to the victims of its tyranny  there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies  or death with its most hideous moral horrors.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had been reserved for the latter.
The Pit and the Pendulum,by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung  until i trembled at the sound of my own voice  and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,shaking in every limb  i groped my way back to the wall resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells  of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses  but now i was the veriest of cowards.
The Pit and the Pendulum,neither could i forget what i had read of these pits that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.
The Pit and the Pendulum,agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours  but at length i again slumbered.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon arousing  i found by my side  as before  a loaf and a pitcher of water.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a burning thirst consumed me  and i emptied the vessel at a draught.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it must have been drugged for scarcely had i drunk  before i became irresistibly drowsy.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a deep sleep fell upon me a sleep like that of death.
The Pit and the Pendulum,how long it lasted of course  i know not  but when  once again  i unclosed my eyes  the objects around me were visible.
The Pit and the Pendulum,by a wild sulphurous lustre  the origin of which i could not at first determine  i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in its size i had been greatly mistaken.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty five yards.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble  vain indeed  for what could be of less importance  under the terrible circumstances which environed me  then the mere dimensions of my dungeon  but my soul took a wild interest in trifles  and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my measurement.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the truth at length flashed upon me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in my first attempt at exploration i had counted fifty two paces  up to the period when i fell  i must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge  in fact  i had nearly performed the circuit of the vault.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i then slept and  upon awaking  i must have returned upon my steps thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my confusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left  and ended it with the wall to the right.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had been deceived  too  in respect to the shape of the enclosure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in feeling my way i had found many angles  and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity  so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep  the angles were simply those of a few slight depressions  or niches  at odd intervals.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the general shape of the prison was square.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron  or some other metal  in huge plates  whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the figures of fiends in aspects of menace  with skeleton forms  and other more really fearful images  overspread and disfigured the walls.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct  but that the colors seemed faded and blurred  as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now noticed the floor  too  which was of stone.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped  but it was the only one in the dungeon.
The Pit and the Pendulum,all this i saw indistinctly and by much effort for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now lay upon my back  and at full length  on a species of low framework of wood.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body  leaving at liberty only my head  and my left arm to such extent that i could  by dint of much exertion  supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw  to my horror  that the pitcher had been removed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i say to my horror for i was consumed with intolerable thirst.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.
The Pit and the Pendulum,looking upward  i surveyed the ceiling of my prison.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was some thirty or forty feet overhead  and constructed much as the side walls.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented  save that  in lieu of a scythe  he held what  at a casual glance  i supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there was something  however  in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively.
The Pit and the Pendulum,while i gazed directly upward at it  for its position was immediately over my own  i fancied that i saw it in motion.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,its sweep was brief  and of course slow.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i watched it for some minutes  somewhat in fear  but more in wonder.
The Pit and the Pendulum,wearied at length with observing its dull movement  i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,a slight noise attracted my notice  and  looking to the floor  i saw several enormous rats traversing it.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they had issued from the well  which lay just within view to my right.
The Pit and the Pendulum,even then  while i gazed  they came up in troops  hurriedly  with ravenous eyes  allured by the scent of the meat.
The Pit and the Pendulum,from this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it might have been half an hour  perhaps even an hour   for i could take but imperfect note of time  before i again cast my eyes upward.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what i then saw confounded and amazed me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as a natural consequence  its velocity was also much greater.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i now observed with what horror it is needless to say that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel  about a foot in length from horn to horn  the horns upward  and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,like a razor also  it seemed massy and heavy  tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was appended to a weighty rod of brass  and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents the pit  whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself the pit  typical of hell  and regarded by rumor as the ultima thule of all their punishments.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest of accidents  i knew that surprise  or entrapment into torment  formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths.
The Pit and the Pendulum,having failed to fall  it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss  and thus  there being no alternative  a different and a milder destruction awaited me.
The Pit and the Pendulum,milder  i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such application of such a term.
The Pit and the Pendulum,what boots it to tell of the long  long hours of horror more than mortal  during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the steel  inch by inch line by line with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages down and still down it came  days passed it might have been that many days passed ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i prayed i wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i grew frantically mad  and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and then i fell suddenly calm  and lay smiling at the glittering death  as a child at some rare bauble.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there was another interval of utter insensibility  it was brief  for  upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but it might have been long  for i knew there were demons who took note of my swoon  and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure.
The Pit and the Pendulum,upon my recovery  too  i felt very oh  inexpressibly sick and weak  as if through long inanition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,even amid the agonies of that period  the human nature craved food.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted  and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as i put a portion of it within my lips  there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy of hope.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet what business had i with hope  it was  as i say  a half formed thought man has many such  which are never completed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i felt that it was of joy of hope  but felt also that it had perished in its formation.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in vain i struggled to perfect to regain it.
The Pit and the Pendulum,long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was an imbecile an idiot.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it would fray the serge of my robe it would return and repeat its operations again and again.
The Pit and the Pendulum,notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep  some thirty feet or more  and the hissing vigor of its descent  sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron  still the fraying of my robe would be all that  for several minutes  it would accomplish.
The Pit and the Pendulum,and at this thought i paused.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dared not go farther than this reflection.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention as if  in so dwelling  i could arrest here the descent of the steel.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,down steadily down it crept.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to the right to the left far and wide with the shriek of a damned spirit  to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger  i alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.
The Pit and the Pendulum,down certainly  relentlessly down  it vibrated within three inches of my bosom  i struggled violently  furiously  to free my left arm.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this was free only from the elbow to the hand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could reach the latter  from the platter beside me  to my mouth  with great effort  but no farther.
The Pit and the Pendulum,could i have broken the fastenings above the elbow  i would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche   down still unceasingly still inevitably down  i gasped and struggled at each vibration.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i shrunk convulsively at its every sweep.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair  they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent  although death would have been a relief  oh  how unspeakable  still i quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen  glistening axe upon my bosom.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver the frame to shrink.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it was hope the hope that triumphs on the rack that whispers to the death condemned even in the dungeons of the inquisition.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe  and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen  collected calmness of despair.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for the first time during many hours or perhaps days i thought.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it now occurred to me that the bandage  or surcingle  which enveloped me  was unique.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i was tied by no separate cord.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band  would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but how fearful  in that case  the proximity of the steel  the result of the slightest struggle how deadly  was it likely  moreover  that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility  was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum  dreading to find my faint  and  as it seemed  my last hope frustrated  i so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions save in the path of the destroying crescent.
The Pit and the Pendulum,scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position  when there flashed upon my mind what i cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which i have previously alluded  and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when i raised food to my burning lips.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the whole thought was now present feeble  scarcely sane  scarcely definite  but still entire.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i proceeded at once  with the nervous energy of despair  to attempt its execution.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which i lay had been literally swarming with rats.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they were wild  bold  ravenous their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.
The Pit and the Pendulum,to what food   i thought   have they been accustomed in the well    they had devoured  in spite of all my efforts to prevent them  all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had fallen into an habitual see saw  or wave of the hand about the platter  and  at length  the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained  i thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever i could reach it  then  raising my hand from the floor  i lay breathlessly still.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change at the cessation of movement.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they shrank alarmedly back  many sought the well.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but this was only for a moment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i had not counted in vain upon their voracity.
The Pit and the Pendulum,observing that i remained without motion  one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame work  and smelt at the surcingle.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this seemed the signal for a general rush.
The Pit and the Pendulum,forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they clung to the wood they overran it  and leaped in hundreds upon my person.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all.
The Pit and the Pendulum,avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they pressed they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps.
The Pit and the Pendulum,they writhed upon my throat  their cold lips sought my own  i was half stifled by their thronging pressure  disgust  for which the world has no name  swelled my bosom  and chilled  with a heavy clamminess  my heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet one minute  and i felt that the struggle would be over.
The Pit and the Pendulum,plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i knew that in more than one place it must be already severed.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with a more than human resolution i lay still.
The Pit and the Pendulum,nor had i erred in my calculations nor had i endured in vain.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i at length felt that i was free.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it had divided the serge of the robe.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it had cut through the linen beneath.
The Pit and the Pendulum,twice again it swung  and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the moment of escape had arrived.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with a steady movement cautious  sidelong  shrinking  and slow i slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for the moment  at least  i was free.
The Pit and the Pendulum,free  and in the grasp of the inquisition  i had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison  when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and i beheld it drawn up  by some invisible force  through the ceiling.
The Pit and the Pendulum,this was a lesson which i took desperately to heart.
The Pit and the Pendulum,my every motion was undoubtedly watched.
The Pit and the Pendulum,free  i had but escaped death in one form of agony  to be delivered unto worse than death in some other.
The Pit and the Pendulum,with that thought i rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in.
The Pit and the Pendulum,something unusual some change which  at first  i could not appreciate distinctly it was obvious  had taken place in the apartment.
The Pit and the Pendulum,for many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction  i busied myself in vain  unconnected conjecture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,during this period  i became aware  for the first time  of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,it proceeded from a fissure  about half an inch in width  extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls  which thus appeared  and were  completely separated from the floor.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i endeavored  but of course in vain  to look through the aperture.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as i arose from the attempt  the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i have observed that  although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct  yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite.
The Pit and the Pendulum,these colors had now assumed  and were momentarily assuming  a startling and most intense brilliancy  that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own.
The Pit and the Pendulum,demon eyes  of a wild and ghastly vivacity  glared upon me in a thousand directions  where none had been visible before  and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.
The Pit and the Pendulum,unreal  even while i breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron  a suffocating odour pervaded the prison  a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies  a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i panted  i gasped for breath  there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors oh  most unrelenting  oh  most demoniac of men  i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell.
The Pit and the Pendulum,amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended  the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i rushed to its deadly brink.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i threw my straining vision below.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses.
The Pit and the Pendulum,yet  for a wild moment  did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw.
The Pit and the Pendulum,at length it forced it wrestled its way into my soul it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason.
The Pit and the Pendulum,oh  for a voice to speak  oh  horror  oh  any horror but this  with a shriek  i rushed from the margin  and buried my face in my hands weeping bitterly.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the heat rapidly increased  and once again i looked up  shuddering as with a fit of the ague.
The Pit and the Pendulum,there had been a second change in the cell and now the change was obviously in the form.
The Pit and the Pendulum,as before  it was in vain that i  at first  endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but not long was i left in doubt.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two fold escape  and there was to be no more dallying with the king of terrors.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the room had been square.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i saw that two of its iron angles were now acute two  consequently  obtuse.
The Pit and the Pendulum,the fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound.
The Pit and the Pendulum,in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge.
The Pit and the Pendulum,but the alteration stopped not here i neither hoped nor desired it to stop.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace.
The Pit and the Pendulum,death   i said   any death but that of the pit   fool  might i have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me  could i resist its glow  or  if even that  could i withstand its pressure  and now  flatter and flatter grew the lozenge  with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation.
The Pit and the Pendulum,its centre  and of course  its greatest width  came just over the yawning gulf.
The Pit and the Pendulum,i shrank back but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.

The Premature Burial,the bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which i had bound up my head  in default of my customary nightcap.
The Premature Burial,the tortures endured  however  were indubitably quite equal for the time  to those of actual sepulture.
The Premature Burial,they were fearfully they were inconceivably hideous  but out of evil proceeded good  for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.
The Premature Burial,my soul acquired tone acquired temper.
The Premature Burial,i went abroad.
The Premature Burial,i took vigorous exercise.
The Premature Burial,i breathed the free air of heaven.
The Premature Burial,i thought upon other subjects than death.
The Premature Burial,i discarded my medical books.
The Premature Burial,buchan  i burned.
The Premature Burial,i read no  night thoughts  no fustian about churchyards no bugaboo tales such as this.
The Premature Burial,in short  i became a new man  and lived a man    s life.
The Premature Burial,from that memorable night  i dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions  and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder  of which  perhaps  they had been less the consequence than the cause.
The Premature Burial,there are moments when  even to the sober eye of reason  the world of our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hell but the imagination of man is no carathis  to explore with impunity its every cavern.
The Premature Burial,alas  the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful but  like the demons in whose company afrasiab made his voyage down the oxus  they must sleep  or they will devour us they must be suffered to slumber  or we perish.
The Domain of Arnheim, from his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend ellison along.
The Domain of Arnheim,nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense.
The Domain of Arnheim,i mean it as synonymous with happiness.
The Domain of Arnheim,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of turgot  price  priestley  and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma  that in man    s very nature lies some hidden principle  the antagonist of bliss.
The Domain of Arnheim,an anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in general  from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content and that  even now  in the present darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social condition  it is not impossible that man  the individual  under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions  may be happy.
The Domain of Arnheim,with opinions such as these my young friend  too  was fully imbued  and thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was  in great measure  the result of preconcert.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which  now and then  stands so well in the stead of experience  mr. ellison would have found himself precipitated  by the very extraordinary success of his life  into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of pre eminent endowments.
The Domain of Arnheim,but it is by no means my object to pen an essay on happiness.
The Domain of Arnheim,the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words.
The Domain of Arnheim,he admitted but four elementary principles  or more strictly  conditions of bliss.
The Domain of Arnheim,that which he considered chief was  strange to say   the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air.
The Domain of Arnheim,the health   he said   attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.
The Domain of Arnheim,he instanced the ecstasies of the fox hunter  and pointed to the tillers of the earth  the only people who  as a class  can be fairly considered happier than others.
The Domain of Arnheim,his second condition was the love of woman.
The Domain of Arnheim,his third  and most difficult of realization  was the contempt of ambition.
The Domain of Arnheim,his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit  and he held that  other things being equal  the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality of this object.
The Domain of Arnheim,ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune.
The Domain of Arnheim,in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men.
The Domain of Arnheim,his intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity.
The Domain of Arnheim,his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire.
The Domain of Arnheim,his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.
The Domain of Arnheim,his possessions had been always ample  but on the attainment of his majority  it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur  and seldom fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their objects.
The Domain of Arnheim,it appears that about a hundred years before mr. ellison    s coming of age  there had died  in a remote province  one mr. seabright ellison.
The Domain of Arnheim,this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune  and  having no immediate connections  conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.
The Domain of Arnheim,minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment  he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood  bearing the name of ellison  who should be alive at the end of the hundred years.
The Domain of Arnheim,many attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest  their ex post facto character rendered them abortive  but the attention of a jealous government was aroused  and a legislative act finally obtained  forbidding all similar accumulations.
The Domain of Arnheim,this act  however  did not prevent young ellison from entering into possession  on his twenty first birthday  as the heir of his ancestor seabright  of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.
The Domain of Arnheim,when it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited  there were  of course  many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.
The Domain of Arnheim,the magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic.
The Domain of Arnheim,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.
The Domain of Arnheim,with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen  it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigue or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility or collecting large museums of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters  of science  of art or endowing  and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity.
The Domain of Arnheim,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir  these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.
The Domain of Arnheim,recourse was had to figures  and these but sufficed to confound.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was seen that  even at three per cent.
The Domain of Arnheim,the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars  which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month  or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day  or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour  or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew.
The Domain of Arnheim,thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up.
The Domain of Arnheim,men knew not what to imagine.
The Domain of Arnheim,there were some who even conceived that mr. ellison would divest himself of at least one half of his fortune  as of utterly superfluous opulence enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the nearest of these he did  in fact  abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the inheritance.
The Domain of Arnheim,i was not surprised  however  to perceive that he had long made up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.
The Domain of Arnheim,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision.
The Domain of Arnheim,in regard to individual charities he had satisfied his conscience.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the possibility of any improvement  properly so called  being effected by man himself in the general condition of man  he had  i am sorry to confess it  little faith.
The Domain of Arnheim,upon the whole  whether happily or unhappily  he was thrown back  in very great measure  upon self.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet.
The Domain of Arnheim,he comprehended  moreover  the true character  the august aims  the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.
The Domain of Arnheim,the fullest  if not the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,some peculiarities  either in his early education  or in the nature of his intellect  had tinged with what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations  and it was this bias  perhaps  which led him to believe that the most advantageous at least  if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise  lies in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness.
The Domain of Arnheim,thus it happened he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation.
The Domain of Arnheim,or it might have been that he neglected to become either  merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on earth.
The Domain of Arnheim,is it not indeed  possible that  while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious  the highest is above that which is termed ambition  and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained  mute and inglorious   i believe that the world has never seen and that  unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion  the world will never see that full extent of triumphant execution  in the richer domains of art  of which the human nature is absolutely capable.
The Domain of Arnheim,ellison became neither musician nor poet  although no man lived more profoundly enamored of music and poetry.
The Domain of Arnheim,under other circumstances than those which invested him  it is not impossible that he would have become a painter.
The Domain of Arnheim,sculpture  although in its nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and consequences  to have occupied  at any time  much of his attention.
The Domain of Arnheim,and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable of expatiating.
The Domain of Arnheim,but ellison maintained that the richest  the truest  and most natural  if not altogether the most extensive province  had been unaccountably neglected.
The Domain of Arnheim,no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet  yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the proper muse the most magnificent of opportunities.
The Domain of Arnheim,here  indeed  was the fairest field for the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty  the elements to enter into combination being  by a vast superiority  the most glorious which the earth could afford.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees  he recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness.
The Domain of Arnheim,and in the direction or concentration of this effort or  more properly  in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment  not only of his own destiny as poet  but of the august purposes for which the deity had implanted the poetic sentiment in man.
The Domain of Arnheim,its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.
The Domain of Arnheim,in his explanation of this phraseology  mr. ellison did much toward solving what has always seemed to me an enigma  i mean the fact  which none but the ignorant dispute  that no such combination of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce.
The Domain of Arnheim,no such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of claude.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the most enchanting of natural landscapes  there will always be found a defect or an excess many excesses and defects.
The Domain of Arnheim,while the component parts may defy  individually  the highest skill of the artist  the arrangement of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement.
The Domain of Arnheim,in short  no position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth  from which an artistical eye  looking steadily  will not find matter of offence in what is termed the  composition  of the landscape.
The Domain of Arnheim,and yet how unintelligible is this  in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme.
The Domain of Arnheim,with her details we shrink from competition.
The Domain of Arnheim,who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip  or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley  the criticism which says  of sculpture or portraiture  that here nature is to be exalted or idealized rather than imitated  is in error.
The Domain of Arnheim,no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the living and breathing beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true  and  having felt its truth here  it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art.
The Domain of Arnheim,having  i say  felt its truth here  for the feeling is no affectation or chimera.
The Domain of Arnheim,the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the artist.
The Domain of Arnheim,he not only believes  but positively knows  that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute the true beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,his reasons  however  have not yet been matured into expression.
The Domain of Arnheim,it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen  fully to investigate and express them.
The Domain of Arnheim,nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of all his brethren.
The Domain of Arnheim,let a  composition  be defective  let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form  let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world  by each will its necessity be admitted.
The Domain of Arnheim,and even far more than this  in remedy of the defective composition  each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.
The Domain of Arnheim,i repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation  and that  therefore  her susceptibility of improvement at this one point  was a mystery i had been unable to solve.
The Domain of Arnheim,my own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would have so arranged the earth    s surface as to have fulfilled at all points man    s sense of perfection in the beautiful  the sublime  or the picturesque  but that this primitive intention had been frustrated by the known geological disturbances disturbances of form and color grouping  in the correction or allaying of which lies the soul of art.
The Domain of Arnheim,the force of this idea was much weakened  however  by the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death.
The Domain of Arnheim,he thus explained  admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first intention.
The Domain of Arnheim,we have then the primitive arrangement of the earth    s surface adapted to his blissful estate  as not existent but designed.
The Domain of Arnheim,the disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.
The Domain of Arnheim,now   said my friend   what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may be really such  as respects only the moral or human point of view.
The Domain of Arnheim,each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the picture  if we can suppose this picture viewed at large in mass from some point distant from the earth    s surface  although not beyond the limits of its atmosphere.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is easily understood that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail  may at the same time injure a general or more distantly observed effect.
The Domain of Arnheim,there may be a class of beings  human once  but now invisible to humanity  to whom  from afar  our disorder may seem order our unpicturesqueness picturesque  in a word  the earth angels  for whose scrutiny more especially than our own  and for whose death refined appreciation of the beautiful  may have been set in array by god the wide landscape gardens of the hemispheres.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the course of discussion  my friend quoted some passages from a writer on landscape gardening who has been supposed to have well treated his theme    there are properly but two styles of landscape gardening  the natural and the artificial.
The Domain of Arnheim,one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country  by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery  cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land  detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size  proportion  and color which  hid from the common observer  are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature.
The Domain of Arnheim,the result of the natural style of gardening  is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.
The Domain of Arnheim,the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.
The Domain of Arnheim,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building.
The Domain of Arnheim,there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles  italian terraces  and a various mixed old english style  which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture.
The Domain of Arnheim,whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening  a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,this is partly pleasing to the eye  by the show of order and design  and partly moral.
The Domain of Arnheim,a terrace  with an old moss covered balustrade  calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days.
The Domain of Arnheim,the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest.
The Domain of Arnheim,from what i have already observed   said ellison   you will understand that i reject the idea  here expressed  of recalling the original beauty of the country.
The Domain of Arnheim,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced.
The Domain of Arnheim,of course  every thing depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities.
The Domain of Arnheim,what is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of size  proportion  and color  is one of those mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.
The Domain of Arnheim,the phrase quoted may mean any thing  or nothing  and guides in no degree.
The Domain of Arnheim,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles  is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius.
The Domain of Arnheim,the negative merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which  in letters  would elevate addison into apotheosis.
The Domain of Arnheim,in truth  while that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding  and can thus be circumscribed in rule  the loftier virtue  which flames in creation  can be apprehended in its results alone.
The Domain of Arnheim,rule applies but to the merits of denial to the excellencies which refrain.
The Domain of Arnheim,beyond these  the critical art can but suggest.
The Domain of Arnheim,we may be instructed to build a  cato   but we are in vain told how to conceive a parthenon or an  inferno.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thing done  however  the wonder accomplished  and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal.
The Domain of Arnheim,the sophists of the negative school who  through inability to create  have scoffed at creation  are now found the loudest in applause.
The Domain of Arnheim,what  in its chrysalis condition of principle  affronted their demure reason  never fails  in its maturity of accomplishment  to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,the author    s observations on the artificial style   continued ellison   are less objectionable.
The Domain of Arnheim,a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty.
The Domain of Arnheim,this is just  as also is the reference to the sense of human interest.
The Domain of Arnheim,the principle expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something beyond it.
The Domain of Arnheim,there may be an object in keeping with the principle an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by individuals  yet which  if attained  would lend a charm to the landscape garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human interest could bestow.
The Domain of Arnheim,a poet  having very unusual pecuniary resources  might  while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture  or  as our author expresses it  of interest  so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty  as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference.
The Domain of Arnheim,it will be seen that  in bringing about such result  he secures all the advantages of interest or design  while relieving his work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art.
The Domain of Arnheim,in the most rugged of wildernesses in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator  yet this art is apparent to reflection only  in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.
The Domain of Arnheim,now let us suppose this sense of the almighty design to be one step depressed to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art to form an intermedium between the two  let us imagine  for example  a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness whose united beauty  magnificence  and strangeness  shall convey the idea of care  or culture  or superintendence  on the part of beings superior  yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of interest is preserved  while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god  nor an emanation from god  but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such as this in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal superintendence of his plans in the unceasing object which these plans afforded in the high spirituality of the object in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel in the perennial springs with which it gratified  without possibility of satiating  that one master passion of his soul  the thirst for beauty  above all  it was in the sympathy of a woman  not unwomanly  whose loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of paradise  that ellison thought to find  and found  exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity  with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day dreams of de sta  l.  i despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish.
The Domain of Arnheim,i wish to describe  but am disheartened by the difficulty of description  and hesitate between detail and generality.
The Domain of Arnheim,perhaps the better course will be to unite the two in their extremes.
The Domain of Arnheim,mr. ellison    s first step regarded  of course  the choice of a locality  and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point  when the luxuriant nature of the pacific islands arrested his attention.
The Domain of Arnheim,in fact  he had made up his mind for a voyage to the south seas  when a night    s reflection induced him to abandon the idea.
The Domain of Arnheim,were i misanthropic   he said   such a locale would suit me.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion  and the difficulty of ingress and egress  would in such case be the charm of charms  but as yet i am not timon.
The Domain of Arnheim,i wish the composure but not the depression of solitude.
The Domain of Arnheim,there must remain with me a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose.
The Domain of Arnheim,there will be frequent hours in which i shall need  too  the sympathy of the poetic in what i have done.
The Domain of Arnheim,let me seek  then  a spot not far from a populous city whose vicinity  also  will best enable me to execute my plans.
The Domain of Arnheim,in search of a suitable place so situated  ellison travelled for several years  and i was permitted to accompany him.
The Domain of Arnheim,a thousand spots with which i was enraptured he rejected without hesitation  for reasons which satisfied me  in the end  that he was right.
The Domain of Arnheim,we came at length to an elevated table land of wonderful fertility and beauty  affording a panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of aetna  and  in ellison    s opinion as well as my own  surpassing the far famed view from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.
The Domain of Arnheim,i am aware   said the traveller  as he drew a sigh of deep delight after gazing on this scene  entranced  for nearly an hour   i know that here  in my circumstances  nine tenths of the most fastidious of men would rest content.
The Domain of Arnheim,this panorama is indeed glorious  and i should rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory.
The Domain of Arnheim,the taste of all the architects i have ever known leads them  for the sake of     prospect      to put up buildings on hill tops.
The Domain of Arnheim,the error is obvious.
The Domain of Arnheim,grandeur in any of its moods  but especially in that of extent  startles  excites and then fatigues  depresses.
The Domain of Arnheim,for the occasional scene nothing can be better for the constant view nothing worse.
The Domain of Arnheim,and  in the constant view  the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent  the worst phase of extent  that of distance.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is at war with the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in     retiring to the country.
The Domain of Arnheim,in looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling abroad in the world.
The Domain of Arnheim,the heart sick avoid distant prospects as a pestilence.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that we found a locality with which ellison professed himself satisfied.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is  of course  needless to say where was the locality.
The Domain of Arnheim,the late death of my friend  in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors  has given to arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity  similar in kind  although infinitely superior in degree  to that which so long distinguished fonthill.
The Domain of Arnheim,the usual approach to arnheim was by the river.
The Domain of Arnheim,the visitor left the city in the early morning.
The Domain of Arnheim,during the forenoon he passed between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty  on which grazed innumerable sheep  their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows.
The Domain of Arnheim,by degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care.
The Domain of Arnheim,this slowly became merged in a sense of retirement this again in a consciousness of solitude.
The Domain of Arnheim,as the evening approached  the channel grew more narrow  the banks more and more precipitous  and these latter were clothed in rich  more profuse  and more sombre foliage.
The Domain of Arnheim,the water increased in transparency.
The Domain of Arnheim,the stream took a thousand turns  so that at no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a furlong.
The Domain of Arnheim,at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted circle  having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage  a roof of ultramarine satin  and no floor the keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which  by some accident having been turned upside down  floated in constant company with the substantial one  for the purpose of sustaining it.
The Domain of Arnheim,the channel now became a gorge although the term is somewhat inapplicable  and i employ it merely because the language has no word which better represents the most striking not the most distinctive feature of the scene.
The Domain of Arnheim,the character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores  it was lost altogether in their other traits.
The Domain of Arnheim,the walls of the ravine  through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed  arose to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet  and inclined so much toward each other as  in a great measure  to shut out the light of day  while the long plume like moss which depended densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead  gave the whole chasm an air of funereal gloom.
The Domain of Arnheim,the windings became more frequent and intricate  and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves  so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction.
The Domain of Arnheim,he was  moreover  enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange.
The Domain of Arnheim,the thought of nature still remained  but her character seemed to have undergone modification  there was a weird symmetry  a thrilling uniformity  a wizard propriety in these her works.
The Domain of Arnheim,not a dead branch not a withered leaf not a stray pebble not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible.
The Domain of Arnheim,the crystal water welled up against the clean granite  or the unblemished moss  with a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.
The Domain of Arnheim,having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours  the gloom deepening every moment  a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought it suddenly  as if dropped from heaven  into a circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge.
The Domain of Arnheim,it was about two hundred yards in diameter  and girt in at all points but one that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered by hills equal in general height to the walls of the chasm  although of a thoroughly different character.
The Domain of Arnheim,their sides sloped from the water    s edge at an angle of some forty five degrees  and they were clothed from base to summit not a perceptible point escaping in a drapery of the most gorgeous flower blossoms  scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of odorous and fluctuating color.
The Domain of Arnheim,this basin was of great depth  but so transparent was the water that the bottom  which seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles  was distinctly visible by glimpses that is to say  whenever the eye could permit itself not to see  far down in the inverted heaven  the duplicate blooming of the hills.
The Domain of Arnheim,on these latter there were no trees  nor even shrubs of any size.
The Domain of Arnheim,the impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness  warmth  color  quietude  uniformity  softness  delicacy  daintiness  voluptuousness  and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies  laborious  tasteful  magnificent  and fastidious  but as the eye traced upward the myriad tinted slope  from its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud  it became  indeed  difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies  sapphires  opals  and golden onyxes  rolling silently out of the sky.
The Domain of Arnheim,the visitor  shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the ravine  is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun  which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon  but which now confronts him  and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another chasm like rift in the hills.
The Domain of Arnheim,but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far  and descends into a light canoe of ivory  stained with arabesque devices in vivid scarlet  both within and without.
The Domain of Arnheim,the poop and beak of this boat arise high above the water  with sharp points  so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent.
The Domain of Arnheim,it lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan.
The Domain of Arnheim,on its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satin wood  but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen.
The Domain of Arnheim,the guest is bidden to be of good cheer that the fates will take care of him.
The Domain of Arnheim,the larger vessel disappears  and he is left alone in the canoe  which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.
The Domain of Arnheim,while he considers what course to pursue  however  he becomes aware of a gentle movement in the fairy bark.
The Domain of Arnheim,it slowly swings itself around until its prow points toward the sun.
The Domain of Arnheim,it advances with a gentle but gradually accelerated velocity  while the slight ripples it creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest melody seem to offer the only possible explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.
The Domain of Arnheim,the canoe steadily proceeds  and the rocky gate of the vista is approached  so that its depths can be more distinctly seen.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded.
The Domain of Arnheim,it is observed  however  that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank dips into the water  still prevails.
The Domain of Arnheim,there is not one token of the usual river d  bris.
The Domain of Arnheim,to the left the character of the scene is softer and more obviously artificial.
The Domain of Arnheim,here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very gentle ascent  forming a broad sward of grass of a texture resembling nothing so much as velvet  and of a brilliancy of green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald.
The Domain of Arnheim,this plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred yards  reaching from the river bank to a wall  fifty feet high  which extends  in an infinity of curves  but following the general direction of the river  until lost in the distance to the westward.
The Domain of Arnheim,this wall is of one continuous rock  and has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream    s southern bank  but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain.
The Domain of Arnheim,the chiselled stone has the hue of ages  and is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy  the coral honeysuckle  the eglantine  and the clematis.
The Domain of Arnheim,the uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height  growing singly or in small groups  both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall  but in close proximity to it  so that frequent limbs  of the black walnut especially  reach over and dip their pendent extremities into the water.
The Domain of Arnheim,farther back within the domain  the vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.
The Domain of Arnheim,these things are observed during the canoe    s gradual approach to what i have called the gate of the vista.
The Domain of Arnheim,on drawing nearer to this  however  its chasm like appearance vanishes  a new outlet from the bay is discovered to the left in which direction the wall is also seen to sweep  still following the general course of the stream.
The Domain of Arnheim,down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very far  for the stream  accompanied by the wall  still bends to the left  until both are swallowed up by the leaves.
The Domain of Arnheim,the boat  nevertheless  glides magically into the winding channel  and here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista.
The Domain of Arnheim,lofty hills  rising occasionally into mountains  and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance  still shut in the scene.
The Domain of Arnheim,floating gently onward  but with a velocity slightly augmented  the voyager  after many short turns  finds his progress apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold  elaborately carved and fretted  and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast sinking sun with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames.
The Domain of Arnheim,this gate is inserted in the lofty wall  which here appears to cross the river at right angles.
The Domain of Arnheim,in a few moments  however  it is seen that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the left  the wall following it as before  while a stream of considerable volume  diverging from the principal one  makes its way  with a slight ripple  under the door  and is thus hidden from sight.
The Domain of Arnheim,the canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate.
The Domain of Arnheim,its ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded.
The Domain of Arnheim,the boat glides between them  and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple mountains  whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit.
The Domain of Arnheim,meantime the whole paradise of arnheim bursts upon the view.
The Domain of Arnheim,there is a gush of entrancing melody  there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor  there is a dream like intermingling to the eye of tall slender eastern trees bosky shrubberies flocks of golden and crimson birds lily fringed lakes meadows of violets  tulips  poppies  hyacinths  and tuberoses long intertangled lines of silver streamlets and  upspringing confusedly from amid all  a mass of semi gothic  semi saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in mid air  glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels  minarets  and pinnacles  and seeming the phantom handiwork  conjointly  of the sylphs  of the fairies  of the genii and of the gnomes.
Landor's Cottage, during a pedestrian trip last summer  through one or two of the river counties of new york  i found myself  as the day declined  somewhat embarrassed about the road i was pursuing.
Landor's Cottage,the land undulated very remarkably  and my path  for the last hour  had wound about and about so confusedly  in its effort to keep in the valleys  that i no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of b    where i had determined to stop for the night.
Landor's Cottage,the sun had scarcely shone strictly speaking during the day  which nevertheless  had been unpleasantly warm.
Landor's Cottage,a smoky mist  resembling that of the indian summer  enveloped all things  and of course  added to my uncertainty.
Landor's Cottage,not that i cared much about the matter.
Landor's Cottage,if i did not hit upon the village before sunset  or even before dark  it was more than possible that a little dutch farmhouse  or something of that kind  would soon make its appearance although  in fact  the neighborhood  perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile  was very sparsely inhabited.
Landor's Cottage,at all events  with my knapsack for a pillow  and my hound as a sentry  a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.
Landor's Cottage,i sauntered on  therefore  quite at ease ponto taking charge of my gun until at length  just as i had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither  were intended to be paths at all  i was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.
Landor's Cottage,there could be no mistaking it.
Landor's Cottage,the traces of light wheels were evident  and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead  there was no obstruction whatever below  even to the passage of a virginian mountain wagon the most aspiring vehicle  i take it  of its kind.
Landor's Cottage,the road  however  except in being open through the wood if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees and except in the particulars of evident wheel tracks bore no resemblance to any road i had before seen.
Landor's Cottage,the tracks of which i speak were but faintly perceptible having been impressed upon the firm  yet pleasantly moist surface of what looked more like green genoese velvet than any thing else.
Landor's Cottage,it was grass  clearly but grass such as we seldom see out of england so short  so thick  so even  and so vivid in color.
Landor's Cottage,not a single impediment lay in the wheel route not even a chip or dead twig.
Landor's Cottage,the stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed not thrown along the sides of the lane  so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half precise  half negligent  and wholly picturesque definition.
Landor's Cottage,clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere  luxuriantly  in the interspaces.
Landor's Cottage,what to make of all this  of course i knew not.
Landor's Cottage,here was art undoubtedly that did not surprise me all roads  in the ordinary sense  are works of art  nor can i say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested  all that seemed to have been done  might have been done here with such natural  capabilities   as they have it in the books on landscape gardening  with very little labor and expense.
Landor's Cottage,no  it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration.
Landor's Cottage,one thing became more and more evident the longer i gazed  an artist  and one with a most scrupulous eye for form  had superintended all these arrangements.
Landor's Cottage,the greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand  and the pittoresque  in the true sense of the italian term  on the other.
Landor's Cottage,there were few straight  and no long uninterrupted lines.
Landor's Cottage,the same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice  usually  but not oftener  at any one point of view.
Landor's Cottage,everywhere was variety in uniformity.
Landor's Cottage,it was a piece of  composition   in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.
Landor's Cottage,i had turned to the right as i entered this road  and now  arising  i continued in the same direction.
Landor's Cottage,the path was so serpentine  that at no moment could i trace its course for more than two or three paces in advance.
Landor's Cottage,its character did not undergo any material change.
Landor's Cottage,presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear and in a few moments afterward  as i turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto  i became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me.
Landor's Cottage,i could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below.
Landor's Cottage,a gentle breeze  however  now arose  as the sun was about descending  and while i remained standing on the brow of the slope  the fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths  and so floated over the scene.
Landor's Cottage,as it came fully into view thus gradually as i describe it piece by piece  here a tree  there a glimpse of water  and here again the summit of a chimney  i could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of  vanishing pictures.
Landor's Cottage,by the time  however  that the fog had thoroughly disappeared  the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills  and thence  as if with a slight chassez to the south  had come again fully into sight  glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west.
Landor's Cottage,suddenly  therefore and as if by the hand of magic this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.
Landor's Cottage,the first coup d      il  as the sun slid into the position described  impressed me very much as i have been impressed  when a boy  by the concluding scene of some well arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama.
Landor's Cottage,not even the monstrosity of color was wanting  for the sunlight came out through the chasm  tinted all orange and purple  while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead  as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.
Landor's Cottage,the little vale into which i thus peered down from under the fog canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long  while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.
Landor's Cottage,it was most narrow at its northern extremity  opening out as it tended southwardly  but with no very precise regularity.
Landor's Cottage,the widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme.
Landor's Cottage,the slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills  unless at their northern face.
Landor's Cottage,here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet  and  as i have mentioned  the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide  but as the visitor proceeded southwardly from the cliff  he found on his right hand and on his left  declivities at once less high  less precipitous  and less rocky.
Landor's Cottage,all  in a word  sloped and softened to the south  and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences  more or less high  except at two points.
Landor's Cottage,one of these i have already spoken of.
Landor's Cottage,it lay considerably to the north of west  and was where the setting sun made its way  as i have before described  into the amphitheatre  through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment  this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point  so far as the eye could trace it.
Landor's Cottage,it seemed to lead up  up like a natural causeway  into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.
Landor's Cottage,the other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,here  generally  the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations  extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards.
Landor's Cottage,in the middle of this extent was a depression  level with the ordinary floor of the valley.
Landor's Cottage,as regards vegetation  as well as in respect to every thing else  the scene softened and sloped to the south.
Landor's Cottage,to the north on the craggy precipice a few paces from the verge up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories  black walnuts  and chestnuts  interspersed with occasional oak  and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially  spread far over the edge of the cliff.
Landor's Cottage,proceeding southwardly  the explorer saw  at first  the same class of trees  but less and less lofty and salvatorish in character  then he saw the gentler elm  succeeded by the sassafras and locust these again by the softer linden  red bud  catalpa  and maple these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties.
Landor's Cottage,the whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone an occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted.
Landor's Cottage,in the bottom of the valley itself  for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides  were to be seen three insulated trees.
Landor's Cottage,one was an elm of fine size and exquisite form  it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,another was a hickory  much larger than the elm  and altogether a much finer tree  although both were exceedingly beautiful  it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance  springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine  and throwing its graceful body  at an angle of nearly forty five degrees  far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre.
Landor's Cottage,about thirty yards east of this tree stood  however  the pride of the valley  and beyond all question the most magnificent tree i have ever seen  unless  perhaps  among the cypresses of the itchiatuckanee.
Landor's Cottage,it was a triple stemmed tulip tree the liriodendron tulipiferum one of the natural order of magnolias.
Landor's Cottage,its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil  and diverging very slightly and gradually  were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage  this was at an elevation of about eighty feet.
Landor's Cottage,the whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet.
Landor's Cottage,nothing can surpass in beauty the form  or the glossy  vivid green of the leaves of the tulip tree.
Landor's Cottage,in the present instance they were fully eight inches wide  but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms.
Landor's Cottage,conceive  closely congregated  a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips  only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture i would convey.
Landor's Cottage,and then the stately grace of the clean  delicately granulated columnar stems  the largest four feet in diameter  at twenty from the ground.
Landor's Cottage,the innumerable blossoms  mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful  although infinitely less majestic  filled the valley with more than arabian perfumes.
Landor's Cottage,the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that i had found in the road  if anything  more deliciously soft  thick  velvety  and miraculously green.
Landor's Cottage,it was hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.
Landor's Cottage,i have spoken of two openings into the vale.
Landor's Cottage,from the one to the northwest issued a rivulet  which came  gently murmuring and slightly foaming  down the ravine  until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory.
Landor's Cottage,here  after encircling the tree  it passed on a little to the north of east  leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south  and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.
Landor's Cottage,at this point  after a series of sweeps  it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure  although roughly oval   that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.
Landor's Cottage,this lakelet was  perhaps  a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part.
Landor's Cottage,no crystal could be clearer than its waters.
Landor's Cottage,its bottom  which could be distinctly seen  consisted altogether  of pebbles brilliantly white.
Landor's Cottage,its banks  of the emerald grass already described  rounded  rather than sloped  off into the clear heaven below  and so clear was this heaven  so perfectly  at times  did it reflect all objects above it  that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced  it was a point of no little difficulty to determine.
Landor's Cottage,the trout  and some other varieties of fish  with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded  had all the appearance of veritable flying fish.
Landor's Cottage,it was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air.
Landor's Cottage,a light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water  was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror.
Landor's Cottage,a small island  fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom  and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building  seemingly a fowl house arose from the lake not far from its northern shore to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light looking and yet very primitive bridge.
Landor's Cottage,it was formed of a single  broad and thick plank of the tulip wood.
Landor's Cottage,this was forty feet long  and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch  preventing all oscillation.
Landor's Cottage,from the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet  which  after meandering for  perhaps  thirty yards  finally passed through the  depression   already described  in the middle of the southern declivity  and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet  made its devious and unnoticed way to the hudson.
Landor's Cottage,the lake was deep at some points thirty feet but the rivulet seldom exceeded three  while its greatest width was about eight.
Landor's Cottage,its bottom and banks were as those of the pond if a defect could have been attributed  in point of picturesqueness  it was that of excessive neatness.
Landor's Cottage,the expanse of the green turf was relieved  here and there  by an occasional showy shrub  such as the hydrangea  or the common snowball  or the aromatic seringa  or  more frequently  by a clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.
Landor's Cottage,these latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the soil  so as to give the plants the appearance of being indigenous.
Landor's Cottage,besides all this  the lawn    s velvet was exquisitely spotted with sheep a considerable flock of which roamed about the vale  in company with three tamed deer  and a vast number of brilliantly plumed ducks.
Landor's Cottage,a very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant attendance upon these animals  each and all.
Landor's Cottage,along the eastern and western cliffs where  toward the upper portion of the amphitheatre  the boundaries were more or less precipitous grew ivy in great profusion so that only here and there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained.
Landor's Cottage,the northern precipice  in like manner  was almost entirely clothed by grape vines of rare luxuriance  some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff  and others from ledges on its face.
Landor's Cottage,the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little domain  was crowned by a neat stone wall  of sufficient height to prevent the escape of the deer.
Landor's Cottage,nothing of the fence kind was observable elsewhere  for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed  any stray sheep  for example  which should attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine  would find its progress arrested  after a few yards     advance  by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as i first drew near the domain.
Landor's Cottage,in short  the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky pass in the road  a few paces below the point at which i stopped to reconnoitre the scene.
Landor's Cottage,i have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course.
Landor's Cottage,its two general directions  as i have said  were first from west to east  and then from north to south.
Landor's Cottage,at the turn  the stream  sweeping backward  made an almost circular loop  so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island  and which included about the sixteenth of an acre.
Landor's Cottage,on this peninsula stood a dwelling house and when i say that this house  like the infernal terrace seen by vathek   etait d    une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre   i mean  merely  that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety in a word  of poetry  for  than in the words just employed  i could scarcely give  of poetry in the abstract  a more rigorous definition  and i do not mean that merely outre was perceptible in any respect.
Landor's Cottage,in fact nothing could well be more simple more utterly unpretending than this cottage.
Landor's Cottage,its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture.
Landor's Cottage,i could have fancied  while i looked at it  that some eminent landscape painter had built it with his brush.
Landor's Cottage,the point of view from which i first saw the valley  was not altogether  although it was nearly  the best point from which to survey the house.
Landor's Cottage,i will therefore describe it as i afterwards saw it from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.
Landor's Cottage,the main building was about twenty four feet long and sixteen broad certainly not more.
Landor's Cottage,its total height  from the ground to the apex of the roof  could not have exceeded eighteen feet.
Landor's Cottage,to the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions  the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house  and the line of its roof  of course  being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining.
Landor's Cottage,at right angles to these buildings  and from the rear of the main one not exactly in the middle extended a third compartment  very small being  in general  one third less than the western wing.
Landor's Cottage,the roofs of the two larger were very steep sweeping down from the ridge beam with a long concave curve  and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front  so as to form the roofs of two piazzas.
Landor's Cottage,these latter roofs  of course  needed no support  but as they had the air of needing it  slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone.
Landor's Cottage,the roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.
Landor's Cottage,between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard dutch bricks  alternately black and red  a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top.
Landor's Cottage,over the gables the roofs also projected very much  in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west.
Landor's Cottage,the principal door was not exactly in the main division  being a little to the east while the two windows were to the west.
Landor's Cottage,these latter did not extend to the floor  but were much longer and narrower than usual they had single shutters like doors the panes were of lozenge form  but quite large.
Landor's Cottage,the door itself had its upper half of glass  also in lozenge panes a movable shutter secured it at night.
Landor's Cottage,the door to the west wing was in its gable  and quite simple a single window looked out to the south.
Landor's Cottage,there was no external door to the north wing  and it also had only one window to the east.
Landor's Cottage,the blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs  with a balustrade  running diagonally across it the ascent being from the south.
Landor's Cottage,under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access to a door leading to the garret  or rather loft for it was lighted only by a single window to the north  and seemed to have been intended as a store room.
Landor's Cottage,the piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors  as is usual  but at the doors and at each window  large  flat irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf  affording comfortable footing in all weather.
Landor's Cottage,excellent paths of the same material not nicely adapted  but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the stones  led hither and thither from the house  to a crystal spring about five paces off  to the road  or to one or two out houses that lay to the north  beyond the brook  and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts and catalpas.
Landor's Cottage,not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead trunk of a fantastic pear tree  so clothed from head to foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could be.
Landor's Cottage,from various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.
Landor's Cottage,in one  a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top  revelled a mocking bird  in another an oriole  in a third the impudent bobolink while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.
Landor's Cottage,the pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet honeysuckle  while from the angle formed by the main structure and its west wing  in front  sprang a grape vine of unexampled luxuriance.
Landor's Cottage,scorning all restraint  it had clambered first to the lower roof then to the higher  and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe on  throwing out tendrils to the right and left  until at length it fairly attained the east gable  and fell trailing over the stairs.
Landor's Cottage,the whole house  with its wings  was constructed of the old fashioned dutch shingles broad  and with unrounded corners.
Landor's Cottage,it is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top after the manner of egyptian architecture  and in the present instance  this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the buildings.
Landor's Cottage,the shingles were painted a dull gray  and the happiness with which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage  can readily be conceived by an artist.
Landor's Cottage,from the position near the stone wall  as described  the buildings were seen at great advantage for the southeastern angle was thrown forward so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts  with the picturesque eastern gable  and at the same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing  with parts of a pretty roof to the spring house  and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.
Landor's Cottage,i did not remain very long on the brow of the hill  although long enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet.
Landor's Cottage,it was clear that i had wandered from the road to the village  and i had thus good traveller    s excuse to open the gate before me  and inquire my way  at all events  so  without more ado  i proceeded.
Landor's Cottage,the road  after passing the gate  seemed to lie upon a natural ledge  sloping gradually down along the face of the north eastern cliffs.
Landor's Cottage,it led me on to the foot of the northern precipice  and thence over the bridge  round by the eastern gable to the front door.
Landor's Cottage,in this progress  i took notice that no sight of the out houses could be obtained.
Landor's Cottage,as i turned the corner of the gable  the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence  but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger.
Landor's Cottage,i held him out my hand  however  in token of amity and i never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy.
Landor's Cottage,he not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail  but absolutely offered me his paw afterward extending his civilities to ponto.
Landor's Cottage,as no bell was discernible  i rapped with my stick against the door  which stood half open.
Landor's Cottage,instantly a figure advanced to the threshold that of a young woman about twenty eight years of age slender  or rather slight  and somewhat above the medium height.
Landor's Cottage,as she approached  with a certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable.
Landor's Cottage,i said to myself   surely here i have found the perfection of natural  in contradistinction from artificial grace.
Landor's Cottage,the second impression which she made on me  but by far the more vivid of the two  was that of enthusiasm.
Landor's Cottage,so intense an expression of romance  perhaps i should call it  or of unworldliness  as that which gleamed from her deep set eyes  had never so sunk into my heart of hearts before.
Landor's Cottage,i know not how it is  but this peculiar expression of the eye  wreathing itself occasionally into the lips  is the most powerful  if not absolutely the sole spell  which rivets my interest in woman.
Landor's Cottage,romance   provided my readers fully comprehended what i would here imply by the word  romance  and  womanliness  seem to me convertible terms  and  after all  what man truly loves in woman  is simply her womanhood.
Landor's Cottage,the eyes of annie  i heard some one from the interior call her  annie  darling    were  spiritual grey   her hair  a light chestnut  this is all i had time to observe of her.
Landor's Cottage,at her most courteous of invitations  i entered passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule.
Landor's Cottage,having come mainly to observe  i took notice that to my right as i stepped in  was a window  such as those in front of the house  to the left  a door leading into the principal room  while  opposite me  an open door enabled me to see a small apartment  just the size of the vestibule  arranged as a study  and having a large bow window looking out to the north.
Landor's Cottage,passing into the parlor  i found myself with mr. landor for this  i afterwards found  was his name.
Landor's Cottage,he was civil  even cordial in his manner  but just then  i was more intent on observing the arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me  than the personal appearance of the tenant.
Landor's Cottage,the north wing  i now saw  was a bed chamber  its door opened into the parlor.
Landor's Cottage,west of this door was a single window  looking toward the brook.
Landor's Cottage,at the west end of the parlor  were a fireplace  and a door leading into the west wing probably a kitchen.
Landor's Cottage,nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor.
Landor's Cottage,on the floor was an ingrain carpet  of excellent texture a white ground  spotted with small circular green figures.
Landor's Cottage,at the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin  they were tolerably full  and hung decisively  perhaps rather formally in sharp  parallel plaits to the floor just to the floor.
Landor's Cottage,the walls were prepared with a french paper of great delicacy  a silver ground  with a faint green cord running zig zag throughout.
Landor's Cottage,its expanse was relieved merely by three of julien    s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons  fastened to the wall without frames.
Landor's Cottage,one of these drawings was a scene of oriental luxury  or rather voluptuousness  another was a  carnival piece   spirited beyond compare  the third was a greek female head a face so divinely beautiful  and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate  never before arrested my attention.
Landor's Cottage,the more substantial furniture consisted of a round table  a few chairs  including a large rocking chair   and a sofa  or rather  settee   its material was plain maple painted a creamy white  slightly interstriped with green  the seat of cane.
Landor's Cottage,the chairs and table were  to match   but the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which planned  the grounds   it is impossible to conceive anything more graceful.
Landor's Cottage,on the table were a few books  a large  square  crystal bottle of some novel perfume  a plain ground glass astral  not solar  lamp with an italian shade  and a large vase of resplendently blooming flowers.
Landor's Cottage,flowers  indeed  of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment.
Landor's Cottage,the fire place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium.
Landor's Cottage,on a triangular shelf in each angle of the room stood also a similar vase  varied only as to its lovely contents.
Landor's Cottage,one or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel  and late violets clustered about the open windows.
Landor's Cottage,it is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail  a picture of mr. landor    s residence as i found it.
Landor's Cottage,how he made it what it was and why with some particulars of mr. landor himself may  possibly form the subject of another article.
William Wilson, let me call myself  for the present  william wilson.
William Wilson,the fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation.
William Wilson,this has been already too much an object for the scorn for the horror for the detestation of my race.
William Wilson,to the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy  oh  outcast of all outcasts most abandoned  to the earth art thou not forever dead  to its honors  to its flowers  to its golden aspirations  and a cloud  dense  dismal  and limitless  does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven   i would not  if i could  here or to day  embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery  and unpardonable crime.
William Wilson,this epoch these later years took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude  whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign.
William Wilson,men usually grow base by degrees.
William Wilson,from me  in an instant  all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle.
William Wilson,from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed  with the stride of a giant  into more than the enormities of an elah gabalus.
William Wilson,what chance what one event brought this evil thing to pass  bear with me while i relate.
William Wilson,death approaches  and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit.
William Wilson,i long  in passing through the dim valley  for the sympathy i had nearly said for the pity of my fellow men.
William Wilson,i would fain have them believe that i have been  in some measure  the slave of circumstances beyond human control.
William Wilson,i would wish them to seek out for me  in the details i am about to give  some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error.
William Wilson,i would have them allow what they cannot refrain from allowing that  although temptation may have erewhile existed as great  man was never thus  at least  tempted before certainly  never thus fell.
William Wilson,and is it therefore that he has never thus suffered  have i not indeed been living in a dream  and am i not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions   i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable  and  in my earliest infancy  i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.
William Wilson,as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed  becoming  for many reasons  a cause of serious disquietude to my friends  and of positive injury to myself.
William Wilson,i grew self willed  addicted to the wildest caprices  and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.
William Wilson,weak minded  and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own  my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me.
William Wilson,some feeble and ill directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part  and  of course  in total triumph on mine.
William Wilson,thenceforward my voice was a household law  and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading strings  i was left to the guidance of my own will  and became  in all but name  the master of my own actions.
William Wilson,my earliest recollections of a school life  are connected with a large  rambling  elizabethan house  in a misty looking village of england  where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees  and where all the houses were excessively ancient.
William Wilson,in truth  it was a dream like and spirit soothing place  that venerable old town.
William Wilson,at this moment  in fancy  i feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply shadowed avenues  inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies  and thrill anew with undefinable delight  at the deep hollow note of the church bell  breaking  each hour  with sullen and sudden roar  upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.
William Wilson,it gives me  perhaps  as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner experience  to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns.
William Wilson,steeped in misery as i am misery  alas  only too real i shall be pardoned for seeking relief  however slight and temporary  in the weakness of a few rambling details.
William Wilson,these  moreover  utterly trivial  and even ridiculous in themselves  assume  to my fancy  adventitious importance  as connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.
William Wilson,let me then remember.
William Wilson,the house  i have said  was old and irregular.
William Wilson,the grounds were extensive  and a high and solid brick wall  topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass  encompassed the whole.
William Wilson,this prison like rampart formed the limit of our domain  beyond it we saw but thrice a week once every saturday afternoon  when  attended by two ushers  we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields and twice during sunday  when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.
William Wilson,of this church the principal of our school was pastor.
William Wilson,with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery  as  with step solemn and slow  he ascended the pulpit  this reverend man  with countenance so demurely benign  with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing  with wig so minutely powdered  so rigid and so vast   could this be he who  of late  with sour visage  and in snuffy habiliments  administered  ferule in hand  the draconian laws of the academy  oh  gigantic paradox  too utterly monstrous for solution   at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.
William Wilson,it was riveted and studded with iron bolts  and surmounted with jagged iron spikes.
William Wilson,what impressions of deep awe did it inspire  it was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned  then  in every creak of its mighty hinges  we found a plenitude of mystery a world of matter for solemn remark  or for more solemn meditation.
William Wilson,the extensive enclosure was irregular in form  having many capacious recesses.
William Wilson,of these  three or four of the largest constituted the play ground.
William Wilson,it was level  and covered with fine hard gravel.
William Wilson,i well remember it had no trees  nor benches  nor anything similar within it.
William Wilson,of course it was in the rear of the house.
William Wilson,in front lay a small parterre  planted with box and other shrubs  but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed such as a first advent to school or final departure thence  or perhaps  when a parent or friend having called for us  we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or midsummer holidays.
William Wilson,but the house  how quaint an old building was this  to me how veritably a palace of enchantment  there was really no end to its windings to its incomprehensible subdivisions.
William Wilson,it was difficult  at any given time  to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.
William Wilson,from each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.
William Wilson,then the lateral branches were innumerable inconceivable and so returning in upon themselves  that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity.
William Wilson,during the five years of my residence here  i was never able to ascertain with precision  in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.
William Wilson,the school room was the largest in the house i could not help thinking  in the world.
William Wilson,it was very long  narrow  and dismally low  with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak.
William Wilson,in a remote and terror inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet  comprising the sanctum   during hours   of our principal  the reverend dr. bransby.
William Wilson,it was a solid structure  with massy door  sooner than open which in the absence of the  dominie   we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure.
William Wilson,in other angles were two other similar boxes  far less reverenced  indeed  but still greatly matters of awe.
William Wilson,one of these was the pulpit of the  classical  usher  one of the  english and mathematical.
William Wilson,interspersed about the room  crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity  were innumerable benches and desks  black  ancient  and time worn  piled desperately with much bethumbed books  and so beseamed with initial letters  names at full length  grotesque figures  and other multiplied efforts of the knife  as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed.
William Wilson,a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room  and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.
William Wilson,encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy  i passed  yet not in tedium or disgust  the years of the third lustrum of my life.
William Wilson,the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it  and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury  or my full manhood from crime.
William Wilson,yet i must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon even much of the outr  .
William Wilson,upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression.
William Wilson,all is gray shadow a weak and irregular remembrance an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.
William Wilson,with me this is not so.
William Wilson,in childhood i must have felt with the energy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid  as deep  and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian medals.
William Wilson,yet in fact in the fact of the world    s view how little was there to remember  the morning    s awakening  the nightly summons to bed  the connings  the recitations  the periodical half holidays  and perambulations  the play ground  with its broils  its pastimes  its intrigues  these  by a mental sorcery long forgotten  were made to involve a wilderness of sensation  a world of rich incident  an universe of varied emotion  of excitement the most passionate and spirit stirring.
William Wilson,oh  le bon temps  que ce si  cle de fer    in truth  the ardor  the enthusiasm  and the imperiousness of my disposition  soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates  and by slow  but natural gradations  gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself  over all with a single exception.
William Wilson,this exception was found in the person of a scholar  who  although no relation  bore the same christian and surname as myself  a circumstance  in fact  little remarkable  for  notwithstanding a noble descent  mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem  by prescriptive right  to have been  time out of mind  the common property of the mob.
William Wilson,in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as william wilson  a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.
William Wilson,my namesake alone  of those who in school phraseology constituted  our set   presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class in the sports and broils of the play ground to refuse implicit belief in my assertions  and submission to my will indeed  to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.
William Wilson,if there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism  it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.
William Wilson,wilson    s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment  the more so as  in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions  i secretly felt that i feared him  and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself  a proof of his true superiority  since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle.
William Wilson,yet this superiority even this equality was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself  our associates  by some unaccountable blindness  seemed not even to suspect it.
William Wilson,indeed  his competition  his resistance  and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes  were not more pointed than private.
William Wilson,he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged  and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel.
William Wilson,in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart  astonish  or mortify myself  although there were times when i could not help observing  with a feeling made up of wonder  abasement  and pique  that he mingled with his injuries  his insults  or his contradictions  a certain most inappropriate  and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner.
William Wilson,i could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.
William Wilson,perhaps it was this latter trait in wilson    s conduct  conjoined with our identity of name  and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day  which set afloat the notion that we were brothers  among the senior classes in the academy.
William Wilson,these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors.
William Wilson,i have before said  or should have said  that wilson was not  in the most remote degree  connected with my family.
William Wilson,but assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins  for  after leaving dr. bransby    s  i casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january       and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence  for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.
William Wilson,it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of wilson  and his intolerable spirit of contradiction  i could not bring myself to hate him altogether.
William Wilson,we had  to be sure  nearly every day a quarrel in which  yielding me publicly the palm of victory  he  in some manner  contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it  yet a sense of pride on my part  and a veritable dignity on his own  kept us always upon what are called  speaking terms   while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers  operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone  perhaps  prevented from ripening into friendship.
William Wilson,it is difficult  indeed  to define  or even to describe  my real feelings towards him.
William Wilson,they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture  some petulant animosity  which was not yet hatred  some esteem  more respect  much fear  with a world of uneasy curiosity.
William Wilson,to the moralist it will be unnecessary to say  in addition  that wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.
William Wilson,it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us  which turned all my attacks upon him   and they were many  either open or covert  into the channel of banter or practical joke  giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun  rather than into a more serious and determined hostility.
William Wilson,but my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful  even when my plans were the most wittily concocted  for my namesake had much about him  in character  of that unassuming and quiet austerity which  while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes  has no heel of achilles in itself  and absolutely refuses to be laughed at.
William Wilson,i could find  indeed  but one vulnerable point  and that  lying in a personal peculiarity  arising  perhaps  from constitutional disease  would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit    s end than myself  my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs  which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper.
William Wilson,of this defect i did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.
William Wilson,wilson    s retaliations in kind were many  and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.
William Wilson,how his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me  is a question i never could solve  but  having discovered  he habitually practised the annoyance.
William Wilson,i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic  and its very common  if not plebeian praenomen.
William Wilson,the words were venom in my ears  and when  upon the day of my arrival  a second william wilson came also to the academy  i felt angry with him for bearing the name  and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it  who would be the cause of its twofold repetition  who would be constantly in my presence  and whose concerns  in the ordinary routine of the school business  must inevitably  on account of the detestable coincidence  be often confounded with my own.
William Wilson,the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance  moral or physical  between my rival and myself.
William Wilson,i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age  but i saw that we were of the same height  and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature.
William Wilson,i was galled  too  by the rumor touching a relationship  which had grown current in the upper forms.
William Wilson,in a word  nothing could more seriously disturb me   although i scrupulously concealed such disturbance   than any allusion to a similarity of mind  person  or condition existing between us.
William Wilson,but  in truth  i had no reason to believe that  with the exception of the matter of relationship  and in the case of wilson himself   this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment  or even observed at all by our schoolfellows.
William Wilson,that he observed it in all its bearings  and as fixedly as i  was apparent  but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance  can only be attributed  as i said before  to his more than ordinary penetration.
William Wilson,his cue  which was to perfect an imitation of myself  lay both in words and in actions  and most admirably did he play his part.
William Wilson,my dress it was an easy matter to copy  my gait and general manner were  without difficulty  appropriated  in spite of his constitutional defect  even my voice did not escape him.
William Wilson,my louder tones were  of course  unattempted  but then the key it was identical  and his singular whisper  it grew the very echo of my own.
William Wilson,how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me   for it could not justly be termed a caricature   i will not now venture to describe.
William Wilson,i had but one consolation in the fact that the imitation  apparently  was noticed by myself alone  and that i had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself.
William Wilson,satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect  he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted  and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.
William Wilson,that the school  indeed  did not feel his design  perceive its accomplishment  and participate in his sneer  was  for many anxious months  a riddle i could not resolve.
William Wilson,perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible  or  more possibly  i owed my security to the master air of the copyist  who  disdaining the letter   which in a painting is all the obtuse can see   gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.
William Wilson,i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me  and of his frequent officious interference with my will.
William Wilson,this interference often took the ungracious character of advice  advice not openly given  but hinted or insinuated.
William Wilson,i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years.
William Wilson,yet  at this distant day  let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience  that his moral sense  at least  if not his general talents and worldly wisdom  was far keener than my own  and that i might  to day  have been a better  and thus a happier man  had i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.
William Wilson,as it was  i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision  and daily resented more and more openly what i considered his intolerable arrogance.
William Wilson,i have said that  in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates  my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship  but  in the latter months of my residence at the academy  although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had  beyond doubt  in some measure  abated  my sentiments  in nearly similar proportion  partook very much of positive hatred.
William Wilson,upon one occasion he saw this  i think  and afterwards avoided  or made a show of avoiding me.
William Wilson,it was about the same period  if i remember aright  that  in an altercation of violence with him  in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard  and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature  i discovered  or fancied i discovered  in his accent  his air  and general appearance  a something which first startled  and then deeply interested me  by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy wild  confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn.
William Wilson,i cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me  at some epoch very long ago some point of the past even infinitely remote.
William Wilson,the delusion  however  faded rapidly as it came  and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular namesake.
William Wilson,the huge old house  with its countless subdivisions  had several large chambers communicating with each other  where slept the greater number of the students.
William Wilson,there were  however   as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned   many little nooks or recesses  the odds and ends of the structure  and these the economic ingenuity of dr. bransby had also fitted up as dormitories  although  being the merest closets  they were capable of accommodating but a single individual.
William Wilson,one of these small apartments was occupied by wilson.
William Wilson,one night  about the close of my fifth year at the school  and immediately after the altercation just mentioned  finding every one wrapped in sleep  i arose from bed  and  lamp in hand  stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.
William Wilson,i had long been plotting one of those ill natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.
William Wilson,it was my intention  now  to put my scheme in operation  and i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued.
William Wilson,having reached his closet  i noiselessly entered  leaving the lamp  with a shade over it  on the outside.
William Wilson,i advanced a step  and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing.
William Wilson,assured of his being asleep  i returned  took the light  and with it again approached the bed.
William Wilson,close curtains were around it  which  in the prosecution of my plan  i slowly and quietly withdrew  when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper  and my eyes  at the same moment  upon his countenance.
William Wilson,i looked  and a numbness  an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame.
William Wilson,my breast heaved  my knees tottered  my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror.
William Wilson,gasping for breath  i lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face.
William Wilson,were these these the lineaments of william wilson  i saw  indeed  that they were his  but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not.
William Wilson,what was there about them to confound me in this manner  i gazed  while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.
William Wilson,not thus he appeared assuredly not thus in the vivacity of his waking hours.
William Wilson,the same name  the same contour of person  the same day of arrival at the academy  and then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait  my voice  my habits  and my manner  was it  in truth  within the bounds of human possibility  that what i now saw was the result  merely  of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation  awe stricken  and with a creeping shudder  i extinguished the lamp  passed silently from the chamber  and left  at once  the halls of that old academy  never to enter them again.
William Wilson,after a lapse of some months  spent at home in mere idleness  i found myself a student at eton.
William Wilson,the brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr. bransby    s  or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i remembered them.
William Wilson,the truth the tragedy of the drama was no more.
William Wilson,i could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses  and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity  and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i hereditarily possessed.
William Wilson,neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton.
William Wilson,the vortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so recklessly plunged  washed away all but the froth of my past hours  engulfed at once every solid or serious impression  and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.
William Wilson,i do not wish  however  to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here a profligacy which set at defiance the laws  while it eluded the vigilance of the institution.
William Wilson,three years of folly  passed without profit  had but given me rooted habits of vice  and added  in a somewhat unusual degree  to my bodily stature  when  after a week of soulless dissipation  i invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers.
William Wilson,we met at a late hour of the night  for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning.
William Wilson,the wine flowed freely  and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions  so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east  while our delirious extravagance was at its height.
William Wilson,madly flushed with cards and intoxication  i was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity  when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent  although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment  and by the eager voice of a servant from without.
William Wilson,he said that some person  apparently in great haste  demanded to speak with me in the hall.
William Wilson,wildly excited with wine  the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me.
William Wilson,i staggered forward at once  and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building.
William Wilson,in this low and small room there hung no lamp  and now no light at all was admitted  save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi circular window.
William Wilson,as i put my foot over the threshold  i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height  and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock  cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment.
William Wilson,this the faint light enabled me to perceive  but the features of his face i could not distinguish.
William Wilson,upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me  and  seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience  whispered the words  william wilson   in my ear.
William Wilson,i grew perfectly sober in an instant.
William Wilson,there was that in the manner of the stranger  and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger  as he held it between my eyes and the light  which filled me with unqualified amazement  but it was not this which had so violently moved me.
William Wilson,it was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular  low  hissing utterance  and  above all  it was the character  the tone  the key  of those few  simple  and familiar  yet whispered syllables  which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days  and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery.
William Wilson,ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone.
William Wilson,although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination  yet was it evanescent as vivid.
William Wilson,for some weeks  indeed  i busied myself in earnest inquiry  or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation.
William Wilson,i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs  and harassed me with his insinuated counsel.
William Wilson,but who and what was this wilson  and whence came he  and what were his purposes  upon neither of these points could i be satisfied  merely ascertaining  in regard to him  that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr. bransby    s academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped.
William Wilson,but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject  my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford.
William Wilson,thither i soon went  the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment  which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart  to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in great britain.
William Wilson,excited by such appliances to vice  my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor  and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels.
William Wilson,but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance.
William Wilson,let it suffice  that among spendthrifts i out heroded herod  and that  giving name to a multitude of novel follies  i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe.
William Wilson,it could hardly be credited  however  that i had  even here  so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate  as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession  and  having become an adept in his despicable science  to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak minded among my fellow collegians.
William Wilson,such  nevertheless  was the fact.
William Wilson,and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved  beyond doubt  the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed.
William Wilson,who  indeed  among my most abandoned associates  would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses  than have suspected of such courses  the gay  the frank  the generous william wilson the noblest and most liberal commoner at oxford him whose follies  said his parasites  were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy whose errors but inimitable whim whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance   i had been now two years successfully busied in this way  when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman  glendinning rich  said report  as herodes atticus his riches  too  as easily acquired.
William Wilson,i soon found him of weak intellect  and  of course  marked him as a fitting subject for my skill.
William Wilson,i frequently engaged him in play  and contrived  with the gambler    s usual art  to let him win considerable sums  the more effectually to entangle him in my snares.
William Wilson,at length  my schemes being ripe  i met him  with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive  at the chambers of a fellow commoner   mr. preston   equally intimate with both  but who  to do him justice  entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design.
William Wilson,to give to this a better coloring  i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten  and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental  and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.
William Wilson,to be brief upon a vile topic  none of the low finesse was omitted  so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.
William Wilson,we had protracted our sitting far into the night  and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist.
William Wilson,the game  too  was my favorite   cart    the rest of the company  interested in the extent of our play  had abandoned their own cards  and were standing around us as spectators.
William Wilson,the parvenu  who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening  to drink deeply  now shuffled  dealt  or played  with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication  i thought  might partially  but could not altogether account.
William Wilson,in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount  when  having taken a long draught of port  he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipating he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.
William Wilson,with a well feigned show of reluctance  and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance  did i finally comply.
William Wilson,the result  of course  did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils  in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt.
William Wilson,for some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine  but now  to my astonishment  i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful.
William Wilson,i say to my astonishment.
William Wilson,glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy  and the sums which he had as yet lost  although in themselves vast  could not  i supposed  very seriously annoy  much less so violently affect him.
William Wilson,that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed  was the idea which most readily presented itself  and  rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates  than from any less interested motive  i was about to insist  peremptorily  upon a discontinuance of the play  when some expressions at my elbow from among the company  and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning  gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which  rendering him an object for the pity of all  should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.
William Wilson,what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.
William Wilson,the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all  and  for some moments  a profound silence was maintained  during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.
William Wilson,i will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.
William Wilson,the wide  heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open  to their full extent  with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished  as if by magic  every candle in the room.
William Wilson,their light  in dying  enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered  about my own height  and closely muffled in a cloak.
William Wilson,the darkness  however  was now total  and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst.
William Wilson,before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all  we heard the voice of the intruder.
William Wilson,gentlemen   he said  in a low  distinct  and never to be forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones   gentlemen  i make no apology for this behaviour  because in thus behaving  i am but fulfilling a duty.
William Wilson,you are  beyond doubt  uninformed of the true character of the person who has to night won at   cart   a large sum of money from lord glendinning.
William Wilson,i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.
William Wilson,please to examine  at your leisure  the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve  and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.
William Wilson,while he spoke  so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor.
William Wilson,in ceasing  he departed at once  and as abruptly as he had entered.
William Wilson,can i shall i describe my sensations  must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned  most assuredly i had little time given for reflection.
William Wilson,many hands roughly seized me upon the spot  and lights were immediately reprocured.
William Wilson,a search ensued.
William Wilson,in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in   cart    and  in the pockets of my wrapper  a number of packs  facsimiles of those used at our sittings  with the single exception that mine were of the species called  technically  arrondees  the honours being slightly convex at the ends  the lower cards slightly convex at the sides.
William Wilson,in this disposition  the dupe who cuts  as customary  at the length of the pack  will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor  while the gambler  cutting at the breadth  will  as certainly  cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.
William Wilson,any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt  or the sarcastic composure  with which it was received.
William Wilson,mr. wilson   said our host  stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs   mr. wilson  this is your property.
William Wilson,the weather was cold  and  upon quitting my own room  i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper  putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.
William Wilson,i presume it is supererogatory to seek here  eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile  for any farther evidence of your skill.
William Wilson,indeed  we have had enough.
William Wilson,you will see the necessity  i hope  of quitting oxford at all events  of quitting instantly my chambers.
William Wilson,abased  humbled to the dust as i then was  it is probable that i should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence  had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character.
William Wilson,the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur  how rare  how extravagantly costly  i shall not venture to say.
William Wilson,its fashion  too  was of my own fantastic invention  for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry  in matters of this frivolous nature.
William Wilson,when  therefore  mr. preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor  and near the folding doors of the apartment  it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror  that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm   where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it   and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every  in even the minutest possible particular.
William Wilson,the singular being who had so disastrously exposed me  had been muffled  i remembered  in a cloak  and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.
William Wilson,retaining some presence of mind  i took the one offered me by preston  placed it  unnoticed  over my own  left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance  and  next morning ere dawn of day  commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent  in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.
William Wilson,i fled in vain.
William Wilson,my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation  and proved  indeed  that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun.
William Wilson,scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns.
William Wilson,years flew  while i experienced no relief.
William Wilson,villain  at rome  with how untimely  yet with how spectral an officiousness  stepped he in between me and my ambition  at vienna  too at berlin and at moscow  where  in truth  had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart  from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee  panic stricken  as from a pestilence  and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain.
William Wilson,and again  and again  in secret communion with my own spirit  would i demand the questions  who is he  whence came he  and what are his objects   but no answer was there found.
William Wilson,and then i scrutinized  with a minute scrutiny  the forms  and the methods  and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision.
William Wilson,but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.
William Wilson,it was noticeable  indeed  that  in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path  had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes  or to disturb those actions  which  if fully carried out  might have resulted in bitter mischief.
William Wilson,poor justification this  in truth  for an authority so imperiously assumed  poor indemnity for natural rights of self agency so pertinaciously  so insultingly denied   i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor  for a very long period of time   while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself   had so contrived it  in the execution of his varied interference with my will  that i saw not  at any moment  the features of his face.
William Wilson,be wilson what he might  this  at least  was but the veriest of affectation  or of folly.
William Wilson,could he  for an instant  have supposed that  in my admonisher at eton in the destroyer of my honor at oxford  in him who thwarted my ambition at rome  my revenge at paris  my passionate love at naples  or what he falsely termed my avarice in egypt  that in this  my arch enemy and evil genius  could fail to recognise the william wilson of my school boy days  the namesake  the companion  the rival  the hated and dreaded rival at dr. bransby    s  impossible  but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.
William Wilson,thus far i had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.
William Wilson,the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character  the majestic wisdom  the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson  added to a feeling of even terror  with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me  had operated  hitherto  to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness  and to suggest an implicit  although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.
William Wilson,but  of late days  i had given myself up entirely to wine  and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control.
William Wilson,i began to murmur  to hesitate  to resist.
William Wilson,and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that  with the increase of my own firmness  that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution  be this as it may  i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope  and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved.
William Wilson,it was at rome  during the carnival of      that i attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio.
William Wilson,i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine table  and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance.
William Wilson,the difficulty  too  of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper  for i was anxiously seeking   let me not say with what unworthy motive  the young  the gay  the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio.
William Wilson,with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited  and now  having caught a glimpse of her person  i was hurrying to make my way into her presence.
William Wilson,at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder  and that ever remembered  low  damnable whisper within my ear.
William Wilson,in an absolute phrenzy of wrath  i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me  and seized him violently by the collar.
William Wilson,he was attired  as i had expected  in a costume altogether similar to my own  wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet  begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier.
William Wilson,a mask of black silk entirely covered his face.
William Wilson,scoundrel   i said  in a voice husky with rage  while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury   scoundrel  impostor  accursed villain  you shall not you shall not dog me unto death  follow me  or i stab you where you stand   and i broke my way from the ball room into a small ante chamber adjoining  dragging him unresistingly with me as i went.
William Wilson,upon entering  i thrust him furiously from me.
William Wilson,he staggered against the wall  while i closed the door with an oath  and commanded him to draw.
William Wilson,he hesitated but for an instant  then  with a slight sigh  drew in silence  and put himself upon his defence.
William Wilson,the contest was brief indeed.
William Wilson,i was frantic with every species of wild excitement  and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude.
William Wilson,in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting  and thus  getting him at mercy  plunged my sword  with brute ferocity  repeatedly through and through his bosom.
William Wilson,at that instant some person tried the latch of the door.
William Wilson,i hastened to prevent an intrusion  and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist.
William Wilson,but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment  that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view  the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce  apparently  a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room.
William Wilson,a large mirror  so at first it seemed to me in my confusion now stood where none had been perceptible before  and  as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror  mine own image  but with features all pale and dabbled in blood  advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.
William Wilson,thus it appeared  i say  but was not.
William Wilson,it was my antagonist it was wilson  who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.
William Wilson,his mask and cloak lay  where he had thrown them  upon the floor.
William Wilson,not a thread in all his raiment not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not  even in the most absolute identity  mine own   it was wilson  but he spoke no longer in a whisper  and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said    you have conquered  and i yield.
William Wilson,yet  henceforward art thou also dead dead to the world  to heaven and to hope  in me didst thou exist and  in my death  see by this image  which is thine own  how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.
The Tell-Tale Heart, true  nervous very  very dreadfully nervous i had been and am  but why will you say that i am mad  the disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them.
The Tell-Tale Heart,above all was the sense of hearing acute.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i heard many things in hell.
The Tell-Tale Heart,how  then  am i mad  hearken  and observe how healthily how calmly i can tell you the whole story.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain  but once conceived  it haunted me day and night.
The Tell-Tale Heart,object there was none.
The Tell-Tale Heart,passion there was none.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i loved the old man.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had never wronged me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had never given me insult.
The Tell-Tale Heart,for his gold i had no desire.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i think it was his eye  yes  it was this  he had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye  with a film over it.
The Tell-Tale Heart,whenever it fell upon me  my blood ran cold  and so by degrees very gradually i made up my mind to take the life of the old man  and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
The Tell-Tale Heart,now this is the point.
The Tell-Tale Heart,you fancy me mad.
The Tell-Tale Heart,madmen know nothing.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but you should have seen me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,you should have seen how wisely i proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation i went to work  i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and every night  about midnight  i turned the latch of his door and opened it oh  so gently  and then  when i had made an opening sufficient for my head  i put in a dark lantern  all closed  closed  that no light shone out  and then i thrust in my head.
The Tell-Tale Heart,oh  you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in  i moved it slowly very  very slowly  so that i might not disturb the old man    s sleep.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,ha  would a madman have been so wise as this  and then  when my head was well in the room  i undid the lantern cautiously oh  so cautiously cautiously  for the hinges creaked  i undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and this i did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but i found the eye always closed  and so it was impossible to do the work  for it was not the old man who vexed me  but his evil eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and every morning  when the day broke  i went boldly into the chamber  and spoke courageously to him  calling him by name in a hearty tone  and inquiring how he has passed the night.
The Tell-Tale Heart,so you see he would have been a very profound old man  indeed  to suspect that every night  just at twelve  i looked in upon him while he slept.
The Tell-Tale Heart,upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a watch    s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.
The Tell-Tale Heart,never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.
The Tell-Tale Heart,to think that there i was  opening the door  little by little  and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i fairly chuckled at the idea  and perhaps he heard me  for he moved on the bed suddenly  as if startled.
The Tell-Tale Heart,now you may think that i drew back but no.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness   for the shutters were close fastened  through fear of robbers   and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door  and i kept pushing it on steadily  steadily.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i had my head in  and was about to open the lantern  when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening  and the old man sprang up in bed  crying out  who    s there    i kept quite still and said nothing.
The Tell-Tale Heart,for a whole hour i did not move a muscle  and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he was still sitting up in the bed listening  just as i have done  night after night  hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
The Tell-Tale Heart,presently i heard a slight groan  and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh  no  it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew the sound well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,many a night  just at midnight  when all the world slept  it has welled up from my own bosom  deepening  with its dreadful echo  the terrors that distracted me.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i say i knew it well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew what the old man felt  and pitied him  although i chuckled at heart.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise  when he had turned in the bed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his fears had been ever since growing upon him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had been trying to fancy them causeless  but could not.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he had been saying to himself  it is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor   or  it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yes  he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions  but he had found all in vain.
The Tell-Tale Heart,all in vain  because death  in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him  and enveloped the victim.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room.
The Tell-Tale Heart,when i had waited a long time  very patiently  without hearing him lie down  i resolved to open a little a very  very little crevice in the lantern.
The Tell-Tale Heart,so i opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily  stealthily until  at length a simple dim ray  like the thread of the spider  shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was open wide  wide open and i grew furious as i gazed upon it.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue  with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones  but i could see nothing else of the old man    s face or person  for i had directed the ray as if by instinct  precisely upon the damned spot.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the sense  now  i say  there came to my ears a low  dull  quick sound  such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i knew that sound well  too.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it was the beating of the old man    s heart.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it increased my fury  as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but even yet i refrained and kept still.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i scarcely breathed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i held the lantern motionless.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eye.
The Tell-Tale Heart,meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it grew quicker and quicker  and louder and louder every instant.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man    s terror must have been extreme  it grew louder  i say  louder every moment  do you mark me well  i have told you that i am nervous  so i am.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and now at the dead hour of the night  amid the dreadful silence of that old house  so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yet  for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but the beating grew louder  louder  i thought the heart must burst.
The Tell-Tale Heart,and now a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbour  the old man    s hour had come  with a loud yell  i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he shrieked once once only.
The Tell-Tale Heart,in an instant i dragged him to the floor  and pulled the heavy bed over him.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then smiled gaily  to find the deed so far done.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but  for many minutes  the heart beat on with a muffled sound.
The Tell-Tale Heart,this  however  did not vex me  it would not be heard through the wall.
The Tell-Tale Heart,at length it ceased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man was dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i removed the bed and examined the corpse.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yes  he was stone  stone dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.
The Tell-Tale Heart,there was no pulsation.
The Tell-Tale Heart,he was stone dead.
The Tell-Tale Heart,his eye would trouble me no more.
The Tell-Tale Heart,if still you think me mad  you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the night waned  and i worked hastily  but in silence.
The Tell-Tale Heart,first of all i dismembered the corpse.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber  and deposited all between the scantlings.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i then replaced the boards so cleverly  so cunningly  that no human eye not even his could have detected any thing wrong.
The Tell-Tale Heart,there was nothing to wash out no stain of any kind no blood spot whatever.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i had been too wary for that.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a tub had caught all ha  ha   when i had made an end of these labors  it was four o    clock still dark as midnight.
The Tell-Tale Heart,as the bell sounded the hour  there came a knocking at the street door.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i went down to open it with a light heart  for what had i now to fear  there entered three men  who introduced themselves  with perfect suavity  as officers of the police.
The Tell-Tale Heart,a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night  suspicion of foul play had been aroused  information had been lodged at the police office  and they  the officers  had been deputed to search the premises.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i smiled  for what had i to fear  i bade the gentlemen welcome.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the shriek  i said  was my own in a dream.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the old man  i mentioned  was absent in the country.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i took my visitors all over the house.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i bade them search search well.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i led them  at length  to his chamber.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i showed them his treasures  secure  undisturbed.
The Tell-Tale Heart,in the enthusiasm of my confidence  i brought chairs into the room  and desired them here to rest from their fatigues  while i myself  in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph  placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the officers were satisfied.
The Tell-Tale Heart,my manner had convinced them.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i was singularly at ease.
The Tell-Tale Heart,they sat  and while i answered cheerily  they chatted of familiar things.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but  ere long  i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.
The Tell-Tale Heart,my head ached  and i fancied a ringing in my ears  but still they sat and still chatted.
The Tell-Tale Heart,the ringing became more distinct  it continued and became more distinct  i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling  but it continued and gained definiteness until  at length  i found that the noise was not within my ears.
The Tell-Tale Heart,no doubt i now grew very pale  but i talked more fluently  and with a heightened voice.
The Tell-Tale Heart,yet the sound increased and what could i do  it was a low  dull  quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i talked more quickly more vehemently  but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,i arose and argued about trifles  in a high key and with violent gesticulations  but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,why would they not be gone  i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides  as if excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,oh god  what could i do  i foamed i raved i swore  i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting  and grated it upon the boards  but the noise arose over all and continually increased.
The Tell-Tale Heart,it grew louder louder louder  and still the men chatted pleasantly  and smiled.
The Tell-Tale Heart,was it possible they heard not  almighty god  no  no  they heard  they suspected  they knew  they were making a mockery of my horror  this i thought  and this i think.
The Tell-Tale Heart,but anything was better than this agony  anything was more tolerable than this derision  i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer  i felt that i must scream or die  and now again  hark  louder  louder  louder  louder    villains   i shrieked   dissemble no more  i admit the deed  tear up the planks  here  here  it is the beating of his hideous heart
Bernice, misery is manifold.
Bernice,the wretchedness of earth is multiform.
Bernice,overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow  its hues are as various as the hues of that arch as distinct too  yet as intimately blended.
Bernice,overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow  how is it that from beauty i have derived a type of unloveliness  from the covenant of peace  a simile of sorrow  but as  in ethics  evil is a consequence of good  so  in fact  out of joy is sorrow born.
Bernice,either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to day  or the agonies which are  have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.
Bernice,my baptismal name is egaeus  that of my family i will not mention.
Bernice,yet there are no towers in the land more time honored than my gloomy  gray  hereditary halls.
Bernice,our line has been called a race of visionaries  and in many striking particulars in the character of the family mansion in the frescos of the chief saloon in the tapestries of the dormitories in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings in the fashion of the library chamber and  lastly  in the very peculiar nature of the library    s contents there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.
Bernice,the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber  and with its volumes of which latter i will say no more.
Bernice,here died my mother.
Bernice,herein was i born.
Bernice,but it is mere idleness to say that i had not lived before that the soul has no previous existence.
Bernice,you deny it  let us not argue the matter.
Bernice,convinced myself  i seek not to convince.
Bernice,there is  however  a remembrance of aerial forms of spiritual and meaning eyes of sounds  musical yet sad a remembrance which will not be excluded  a memory like a shadow vague  variable  indefinite  unsteady  and like a shadow  too  in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.
Bernice,in that chamber was i born.
Bernice,thus awaking from the long night of what seemed  but was not  nonentity  at once into the very regions of fairy land into a palace of imagination into the wild dominions of monastic thought and erudition it is not singular that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye that i loitered away my boyhood in books  and dissipated my youth in reverie  but it is singular that as years rolled away  and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought.
Bernice,the realities of the world affected me as visions  and as visions only  while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became  in turn  not the material of my every day existence  but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.
Bernice,berenice and i were cousins  and we grew up together in my paternal halls.
Bernice,yet differently we grew i  ill of health  and buried in gloom she  agile  graceful  and overflowing with energy  hers  the ramble on the hill side mine the studies of the cloister  i  living within my own heart  and addicted  body and soul  to the most intense and painful meditation she  roaming carelessly through life  with no thought of the shadows in her path  or the silent flight of the raven winged hours.
Bernice,berenice  i call upon her name berenice  and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound  ah  vividly is her image before me now  as in the early days of her light heartedness and joy  oh  gorgeous yet fantastic beauty  oh  sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim  oh  naiad among its fountains  and then then all is mystery and terror  and a tale which should not be told.
Bernice,disease a fatal disease  fell like the simoon upon her frame  and  even while i gazed upon her  the spirit of change swept over her  pervading her mind  her habits  and her character  and  in a manner the most subtle and terrible  disturbing even the identity of her person  alas  the destroyer came and went  and the victim where is she  i knew her not or knew her no longer as berenice.
Bernice,among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin  may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature  a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution  and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances  startlingly abrupt.
Bernice,in the mean time my own disease for i have been told that i should call it by no other appellation my own disease  then  grew rapidly upon me  and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form hourly and momently gaining vigor and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy.
Bernice,this monomania  if i must so term it  consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive.
Bernice,it is more than probable that i am not understood  but i fear  indeed  that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader  an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which  in my case  the powers of meditation  not to speak technically  busied and buried themselves  in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.
Bernice,to muse for long unwearied hours  with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin  or in the typography of a book  to become absorbed  for the better part of a summer    s day  in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor  to lose myself  for an entire night  in watching the steady flame of a lamp  or the embers of a fire  to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower  to repeat  monotonously  some common word  until the sound  by dint of frequent repetition  ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind  to lose all sense of motion or physical existence  by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in  such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties  not  indeed  altogether unparalleled  but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.
Bernice,yet let me not be misapprehended.
Bernice,the undue  earnest  and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous  must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind  and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination.
Bernice,it was not even  as might be at first supposed  an extreme condition  or exaggeration of such propensity  but primarily and essentially distinct and different.
Bernice,in the one instance  the dreamer  or enthusiast  being interested by an object usually not frivolous  imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom  until  at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury  he finds the incitamentum  or first cause of his musings  entirely vanished and forgotten.
Bernice,in my case  the primary object was invariably frivolous  although assuming  through the medium of my distempered vision  a refracted and unreal importance.
Bernice,few deductions  if any  were made  and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre.
Bernice,the meditations were never pleasurable  and  at the termination of the reverie  the first cause  so far from being out of sight  had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease.
Bernice,in a word  the powers of mind more particularly exercised were  with me  as i have said before  the attentive  and are  with the day dreamer  the speculative.
Bernice,my books  at this epoch  if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder  partook  it will be perceived  largely  in their imaginative and inconsequential nature  of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself.
Bernice,i well remember  among others  the treatise of the noble italian  coelius secundus curio   de amplitudine beati regni dei   st. austin    s great work  the  city of god   and tertullian    s  de carne christi   in which the paradoxical sentence  mortuus est dei filius  credible est quia ineptum est  et sepultus resurrexit  certum est quia impossibile est   occupied my undivided time  for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.
Bernice,thus it will appear that  shaken from its balance only by trivial things  my reason bore resemblance to that ocean crag spoken of by ptolemy hephestion  which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence  and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds  trembled only to the touch of the flower called asphodel.
Bernice,and although  to a careless thinker  it might appear a matter beyond doubt  that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady  in the moral condition of berenice  would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature i have been at some trouble in explaining  yet such was not in any degree the case.
Bernice,in the lucid intervals of my infirmity  her calamity  indeed  gave me pain  and  taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life  i did not fail to ponder  frequently and bitterly  upon the wonder working means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass.
Bernice,but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease  and were such as would have occurred  under similar circumstances  to the ordinary mass of mankind.
Bernice,true to its own character  my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of berenice in the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.
Bernice,during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty  most surely i had never loved her.
Bernice,in the strange anomaly of my existence  feelings with me  had never been of the heart  and my passions always were of the mind.
Bernice,through the gray of the early morning among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday and in the silence of my library at night she had flitted by my eyes  and i had seen her not as the living and breathing berenice  but as the berenice of a dream  not as a being of the earth  earthy  but as the abstraction of such a being  not as a thing to admire  but to analyze  not as an object of love  but as the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation.
Bernice,and now now i shuddered in her presence  and grew pale at her approach  yet  bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition  i called to mind that she had loved me long  and  in an evil moment  i spoke to her of marriage.
Bernice,and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching  when  upon an afternoon in the winter of the year one of those unseasonably warm  calm  and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful halcyon       i sat   and sat  as i thought  alone   in the inner apartment of the library.
Bernice,but  uplifting my eyes  i saw that berenice stood before me.
Bernice,was it my own excited imagination or the misty influence of the atmosphere or the uncertain twilight of the chamber or the gray draperies which fell around her figure that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline  i could not tell.
Bernice,she spoke no word  and i not for worlds could i have uttered a syllable.
Bernice,an icy chill ran through my frame  a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me  a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul  and sinking back upon the chair  i remained for some time breathless and motionless  with my eyes riveted upon her person.
Bernice,alas  its emaciation was excessive  and not one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour.
Bernice,my burning glances at length fell upon the face.
Bernice,the forehead was high  and very pale  and singularly placid  and the once jetty hair fell partially over it  and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets  now of a vivid yellow  and jarring discordantly  in their fantastic character  with the reigning melancholy of the countenance.
Bernice,the eyes were lifeless  and lustreless  and seemingly pupilless  and i shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips.
Bernice,they parted  and in a smile of peculiar meaning  the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my view.
Bernice,would to god that i had never beheld them  or that  having done so  i had died   the shutting of a door disturbed me  and  looking up  i found that my cousin had departed from the chamber.
Bernice,but from the disordered chamber of my brain  had not  alas  departed  and would not be driven away  the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth.
Bernice,not a speck on their surface not a shade on their enamel not an indenture in their edges but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory.
Bernice,i saw them now even more unequivocally than i beheld them then.
Bernice,the teeth  the teeth  they were here  and there  and everywhere  and visibly and palpably before me  long  narrow  and excessively white  with the pale lips writhing about them  as in the very moment of their first terrible development.
Bernice,then came the full fury of my monomania  and i struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence.
Bernice,in the multiplied objects of the external world i had no thoughts but for the teeth.
Bernice,for these i longed with a phrenzied desire.
Bernice,all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation.
Bernice,they they alone were present to the mental eye  and they  in their sole individuality  became the essence of my mental life.
Bernice,i held them in every light.
Bernice,i turned them in every attitude.
Bernice,i surveyed their characteristics.
Bernice,i dwelt upon their peculiarities.
Bernice,i pondered upon their conformation.
Bernice,i mused upon the alteration in their nature.
Bernice,i shuddered as i assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power  and even when unassisted by the lips  a capability of moral expression.
Bernice,of mademoiselle salle it has been well said   que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments   and of berenice i more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des id  es.
Bernice,des id  es  ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me  des id  es  ah  therefore it was that i coveted them so madly  i felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace  in giving me back to reason.
Bernice,and the evening closed in upon me thus and then the darkness came  and tarried  and went and the day again dawned and the mists of a second night were now gathering around and still i sat motionless in that solitary room and still i sat buried in meditation and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy  as  with the most vivid hideous distinctness  it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber.
Bernice,at length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay  and thereunto  after a pause  succeeded the sound of troubled voices  intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow or of pain.
Bernice,i arose from my seat  and throwing open one of the doors of the library  saw standing out in the ante chamber a servant maiden  all in tears  who told me that berenice was no more  she had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning  and now  at the closing in of the night  the grave was ready for its tenant  and all the preparations for the burial were completed.
Bernice,i found myself sitting in the library  and again sitting there alone.
Bernice,it seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.
Bernice,i knew that it was now midnight  and i was well aware  that since the setting of the sun  berenice had been interred.
Bernice,but of that dreary period which intervened i had no positive  at least no definite comprehension.
Bernice,yet its memory was replete with horror horror more horrible from being vague  and terror more terrible from ambiguity.
Bernice,it was a fearful page in the record my existence  written all over with dim  and hideous  and unintelligible recollections.
Bernice,i strived to decypher them  but in vain  while ever and anon  like the spirit of a departed sound  the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears.
Bernice,i had done a deed what was it  i asked myself the question aloud  and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered me   what was it    on the table beside me burned a lamp  and near it lay a little box.
Bernice,it was of no remarkable character  and i had seen it frequently before  for it was the property of the family physician  but how came it there  upon my table  and why did i shudder in regarding it  these things were in no manner to be accounted for  and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book  and to a sentence underscored therein.
Bernice,the words were the singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiat   dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem  curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.
Bernice,why then  as i perused them  did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end  and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins   there came a light tap at the library door and  pale as the tenant of a tomb  a menial entered upon tiptoe.
Bernice,his looks were wild with terror  and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous  husky  and very low.
Bernice,what said he  some broken sentences i heard.
Bernice,he told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night of the gathering together of the household of a search in the direction of the sound  and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave of a disfigured body enshrouded  yet still breathing still palpitating still alive   he pointed to garments  they were muddy and clotted with gore.
Bernice,i spoke not  and he took me gently by the hand  it was indented with the impress of human nails.
Bernice,he directed my attention to some object against the wall.
Bernice,i looked at it for some minutes  it was a spade.
Bernice,with a shriek i bounded to the table  and grasped the box that lay upon it.
Bernice,but i could not force it open  and in my tremor  it slipped from my hands  and fell heavily  and burst into pieces  and from it  with a rattling sound  there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery  intermingled with thirty two small  white and ivory looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor.
Eleonora, i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion.
Eleonora,men have called me mad  but the question is not yet settled  whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence   whether much that is glorious   whether all that is profound   does not spring from disease of thought   from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.
Eleonora,they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.
Eleonora,in their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity  and thrill  in awakening  to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.
Eleonora,in snatches  they learn something of the wisdom which is of good  and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.
Eleonora,they penetrate  however  rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the    light ineffable    and again  like the adventures of the nubian geographer     agressi sunt mare tenebrarum  quid in eo esset exploraturi.
Eleonora,we will say  then  that i am mad.
Eleonora,i grant  at least  that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence   the condition of a lucid reason  not to be disputed  and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life   and a condition of shadow and doubt  appertaining to the present  and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being.
Eleonora,therefore  what i shall tell of the earlier period  believe  and to what i may relate of the later time  give only such credit as may seem due  or doubt it altogether  or  if doubt it ye cannot  then play unto its riddle the oedipus.
Eleonora,she whom i loved in youth  and of whom i now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances  was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed.
Eleonora,eleonora was the name of my cousin.
Eleonora,we had always dwelled together  beneath a tropical sun  in the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,no unguided footstep ever came upon that vale  for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it  shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses.
Eleonora,no path was trodden in its vicinity  and  to reach our happy home  there was need of putting back  with force  the foliage of many thousands of forest trees  and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers.
Eleonora,thus it was that we lived all alone  knowing nothing of the world without the valley   i  and my cousin  and her mother.
Eleonora,from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain  there crept out a narrow and deep river  brighter than all save the eyes of eleonora  and  winding stealthily about in mazy courses  it passed away  at length  through a shadowy gorge  among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued.
Eleonora,we called it the    river of silence    for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.
Eleonora,no murmur arose from its bed  and so gently it wandered along  that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze  far down within its bosom  stirred not at all  but lay in a motionless content  each in its own old station  shining on gloriously forever.
Eleonora,the margin of the river  and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel  as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom    these spots  not less than the whole surface of the valley  from the river to the mountains that girdled it in  were carpeted all by a soft green grass  thick  short  perfectly even  and vanilla perfumed  but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup  the white daisy  the purple violet  and the ruby red asphodel  that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones  of the love and of the glory of god.
Eleonora,and  here and there  in groves about this grass  like wildernesses of dreams  sprang up fantastic trees  whose tall slender stems stood not upright  but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon day into the centre of the valley.
Eleonora,their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver  and was smoother than all save the cheeks of eleonora  so that  but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long  tremulous lines  dallying with the zephyrs  one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun.
Eleonora,hand in hand about this valley  for fifteen years  roamed i with eleonora before love entered within our hearts.
Eleonora,it was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life  and of the fourth of my own  that we sat  locked in each other   s embrace  beneath the serpent like trees  and looked down within the water of the river of silence at our images therein.
Eleonora,we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day  and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few.
Eleonora,we had drawn the god eros from that wave  and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers.
Eleonora,the passions which had for centuries distinguished our race  came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted  and together breathed a delirious bliss over the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,a change fell upon all things.
Eleonora,strange  brilliant flowers  star shaped  burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before.
Eleonora,the tints of the green carpet deepened  and when  one by one  the white daisies shrank away  there sprang up in place of them  ten by ten of the ruby red asphodel.
Eleonora,and life arose in our paths  for the tall flamingo  hitherto unseen  with all gay glowing birds  flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.
Eleonora,the golden and silver fish haunted the river  out of the bosom of which issued  little by little  a murmur that swelled  at length  into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of   olus   sweeter than all save the voice of eleonora.
Eleonora,and now  too  a voluminous cloud  which we had long watched in the regions of hesper  floated out thence  all gorgeous in crimson and gold  and settling in peace above us  sank  day by day  lower and lower  until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains  turning all their dimness into magnificence  and shutting us up  as if forever  within a magic prison house of grandeur and of glory.
Eleonora,the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim  but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.
Eleonora,no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart  and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the valley of the many colored grass  and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.
Eleonora,at length  having spoken one day  in tears  of the last sad change which must befall humanity  she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme  interweaving it into all our converse  as  in the songs of the bard of schiraz  the same images are found occurring  again and again  in every impressive variation of phrase.
Eleonora,she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom   that  like the ephemeron  she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die  but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me  one evening at twilight  by the banks of the river of silence.
Eleonora,she grieved to think that  having entombed her in the valley of the many colored grass  i would quit forever its happy recesses  transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world.
Eleonora,and  then and there  i threw myself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora  and offered up a vow  to herself and to heaven  that i would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of earth   that i would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory  or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.
Eleonora,and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow.
Eleonora,and the curse which i invoked of him and of her  a saint in helusion should i prove traitorous to that promise  involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here.
Eleonora,and the bright eyes of eleonora grew brighter at my words  and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast  and she trembled and very bitterly wept  but she made acceptance of the vow   for what was she but a child   and it made easy to her the bed of her death.
Eleonora,and she said to me  not many days afterward  tranquilly dying  that  because of what i had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed  and  if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night  but  if this thing were  indeed  beyond the power of the souls in paradise  that she would  at least  give me frequent indications of her presence  sighing upon me in the evening winds  or filling the air which i breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.
Eleonora,and  with these words upon her lips  she yielded up her innocent life  putting an end to the first epoch of my own.
Eleonora,thus far i have faithfully said.
Eleonora,but as i pass the barrier in time   s path  formed by the death of my beloved  and proceed with the second era of my existence  i feel that a shadow gathers over my brain  and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record.
Eleonora,but let me on.
Eleonora,years dragged themselves along heavily  and still i dwelled within the valley of the many colored grass  but a second change had come upon all things.
Eleonora,the star shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees  and appeared no more.
Eleonora,the tints of the green carpet faded  and  one by one  the ruby red asphodels withered away  and there sprang up  in place of them  ten by ten  dark  eye like violets  that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew.
Eleonora,and life departed from our paths  for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us  but flew sadly from the vale into the hills  with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company.
Eleonora,and the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.
Eleonora,and the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind harp of   olus  and more divine than all save the voice of eleonora  it died little by little away  in murmurs growing lower and lower  until the stream returned  at length  utterly  into the solemnity of its original silence.
Eleonora,and then  lastly  the voluminous cloud uprose  and  abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old  fell back into the regions of hesper  and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten  for i heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels  and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley  and at lone hours  when my heart beat heavily  the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs  and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air  and once   oh  but once only  i was awakened from a slumber  like the slumber of death  by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
Eleonora,but the void within my heart refused  even thus  to be filled.
Eleonora,i longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing.
Eleonora,at length the valley pained me through its memories of eleonora  and i left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.
Eleonora,i found myself within a strange city  where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed so long in the valley of the many colored grass.
Eleonora,the pomps and pageantries of a stately court  and the mad clangor of arms  and the radiant loveliness of women  bewildered and intoxicated my brain.
Eleonora,but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows  and the indications of the presence of eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night.
Eleonora,suddenly these manifestations they ceased  and the world grew dark before mine eyes  and i stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed  at the terrible temptations which beset me  for there came from some far  far distant and unknown land  into the gay court of the king i served  a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once   at whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle  in the most ardent  in the most abject worship of love.
Eleonora,what  indeed  was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor  and the delirium  and the spirit lifting ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengarde    oh  bright was the seraph ermengarde  and in that knowledge i had room for none other.
Eleonora,oh  divine was the angel ermengarde  and as i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes  i thought only of them   and of her.
Eleonora,i wedded   nor dreaded the curse i had invoked  and its bitterness was not visited upon me.
Eleonora,and once   but once again in the silence of the night  there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me  and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice  saying      sleep in peace  for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth  and  in taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde  thou art absolved  for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven  of thy vows unto eleonora.
Frankenstein, you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.
Frankenstein,i arrived here yesterday  and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
Frankenstein,i am already far north of london  and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh  i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks  which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.
Frankenstein,do you understand this feeling  this breeze  which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing  gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Frankenstein,inspirited by this wind of promise  my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.
Frankenstein,i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation  it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.
Frankenstein,there  margaret  the sun is for ever visible  its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
Frankenstein,there   for with your leave  my sister  i will put some trust in preceding navigators   there snow and frost are banished  and  sailing over a calm sea  we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.
Frankenstein,its productions and features may be without example  as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.
Frankenstein,what may not be expected in a country of eternal light  i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.
Frankenstein,i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited  and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.
Frankenstein,these are my enticements  and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat  with his holiday mates  on an expedition of discovery up his native river.
Frankenstein,but supposing all these conjectures to be false  you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind  to the last generation  by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries  to reach which at present so many months are requisite  or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet  which  if at all possible  can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
Frankenstein,these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter  and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven  for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose   a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
Frankenstein,this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.
Frankenstein,i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole.
Frankenstein,you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas    library.
Frankenstein,my education was neglected  yet i was passionately fond of reading.
Frankenstein,these volumes were my study day and night  and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt  as a child  on learning that my father   s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
Frankenstein,these visions faded when i perused  for the first time  those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.
Frankenstein,i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation  i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated.
Frankenstein,you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment.
Frankenstein,but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin  and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
Frankenstein,six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking.
Frankenstein,i can  even now  remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise.
Frankenstein,i commenced by inuring my body to hardship.
Frankenstein,i accompanied the whale fishers on several expeditions to the north sea  i voluntarily endured cold  famine  thirst  and want of sleep  i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics  the theory of medicine  and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.
Frankenstein,twice i actually hired myself as an under mate in a greenland whaler  and acquitted myself to admiration.
Frankenstein,i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness  so valuable did he consider my services.
Frankenstein,and now  dear margaret  do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose  my life might have been passed in ease and luxury  but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.
Frankenstein,oh  that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative  my courage and my resolution is firm  but my hopes fluctuate  and my spirits are often depressed.
Frankenstein,i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage  the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude  i am required not only to raise the spirits of others  but sometimes to sustain my own  when theirs are failing.
Frankenstein,this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia.
Frankenstein,they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges  the motion is pleasant  and  in my opinion  far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach.
Frankenstein,the cold is not excessive  if you are wrapped in furs   a dress which i have already adopted  for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours  when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.
Frankenstein,i have no ambition to lose my life on the post road between st. petersburgh and archangel.
Frankenstein,i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks  and my intention is to hire a ship there  which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner  and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale fishing.
Frankenstein,i do not intend to sail until the month of june  and when shall i return  ah  dear sister  how can i answer this question  if i succeed  many  many months  perhaps years  will pass before you and i may meet.
Frankenstein,if i fail  you will see me again soon  or never.
Frankenstein,farewell  my dear  excellent margaret.
Frankenstein,heaven shower down blessings on you  and save me  that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.
Frankenstein,how slowly the time passes here  encompassed as i am by frost and snow  yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.
Frankenstein,i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors  those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
Frankenstein,but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy  and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil  i have no friend  margaret  when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success  there will be none to participate my joy  if i am assailed by disappointment  no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.
Frankenstein,i shall commit my thoughts to paper  it is true  but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.
Frankenstein,i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me  whose eyes would reply to mine.
Frankenstein,you may deem me romantic  my dear sister  but i bitterly feel the want of a friend.
Frankenstein,i have no one near me  gentle yet courageous  possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind  whose tastes are like my own  to approve or amend my plans.
Frankenstein,how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother  i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.
Frankenstein,but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self educated  for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas    books of voyages.
Frankenstein,at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country  but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.
Frankenstein,now i am twenty eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.
Frankenstein,it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent  but they want  as the painters call it  keeping  and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic  and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.
Frankenstein,well  these are useless complaints  i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean  nor even here in archangel  among merchants and seamen.
Frankenstein,yet some feelings  unallied to the dross of human nature  beat even in these rugged bosoms.
Frankenstein,my lieutenant  for instance  is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise  he is madly desirous of glory  or rather  to word my phrase more characteristically  of advancement in his profession.
Frankenstein,he is an englishman  and in the midst of national and professional prejudices  unsoftened by cultivation  retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.
Frankenstein,i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel  finding that he was unemployed in this city  i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
Frankenstein,the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.
Frankenstein,this circumstance  added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage  made me very desirous to engage him.
Frankenstein,a youth passed in solitude  my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage  has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship  i have never believed it to be necessary  and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew  i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.
Frankenstein,i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner  from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.
Frankenstein,this  briefly  is his story.
Frankenstein,some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune  and having amassed a considerable sum in prize money  the father of the girl consented to the match.
Frankenstein,he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony  but she was bathed in tears  and throwing herself at his feet  entreated him to spare her  confessing at the same time that she loved another  but that he was poor  and that her father would never consent to the union.
Frankenstein,my generous friend reassured the suppliant  and on being informed of the name of her lover  instantly abandoned his pursuit.
Frankenstein,he had already bought a farm with his money  on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life  but he bestowed the whole on his rival  together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock  and then himself solicited the young woman   s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.
Frankenstein,but the old man decidedly refused  thinking himself bound in honour to my friend  who  when he found the father inexorable  quitted his country  nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.
Frankenstein,what a noble fellow    you will exclaim.
Frankenstein,he is so  but then he is wholly uneducated  he is as silent as a turk  and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him  which  while it renders his conduct the more astonishing  detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.
Frankenstein,yet do not suppose  because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know  that i am wavering in my resolutions.
Frankenstein,those are as fixed as fate  and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.
Frankenstein,the winter has been dreadfully severe  but the spring promises well  and it is considered as a remarkably early season  so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected.
Frankenstein,i shall do nothing rashly  you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
Frankenstein,i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.
Frankenstein,it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation  half pleasurable and half fearful  with which i am preparing to depart.
Frankenstein,i am going to unexplored regions  to    the land of mist and snow    but i shall kill no albatross  therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the    ancient mariner.
Frankenstein,you will smile at my allusion  but i will disclose a secret.
Frankenstein,i have often attributed my attachment to  my passionate enthusiasm for  the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.
Frankenstein,there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand.
Frankenstein,i am practically industrious   painstaking  a workman to execute with perseverance and labour   but besides this there is a love for the marvellous  a belief in the marvellous  intertwined in all my projects  which hurries me out of the common pathways of men  even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore.
Frankenstein,but to return to dearer considerations.
Frankenstein,shall i meet you again  after having traversed immense seas  and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america  i dare not expect such success  yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.
Frankenstein,continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity  i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits.
Frankenstein,i love you very tenderly.
Frankenstein,remember me with affection  should you never hear from me again.
Frankenstein,my dear sister   i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe   and well advanced on my voyage.
Frankenstein,this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel  more fortunate than i  who may not see my native land  perhaps  for many years.
Frankenstein,i am  however  in good spirits  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose  nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us  indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing  appear to dismay them.
Frankenstein,we have already reached a very high latitude  but it is the height of summer  and although not so warm as in england  the southern gales  which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain  breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected.
Frankenstein,no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.
Frankenstein,one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record  and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
Frankenstein,adieu  my dear margaret.
Frankenstein,be assured that for my own sake  as well as yours  i will not rashly encounter danger.
Frankenstein,i will be cool  persevering  and prudent.
Frankenstein,but success shall crown my endeavours.
Frankenstein,wherefore not  thus far i have gone  tracing a secure way over the pathless seas  the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.
Frankenstein,why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element  what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man   my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.
Frankenstein,but i must finish.
Frankenstein,heaven bless my beloved sister   so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it  although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.
Frankenstein,last monday  july   st  we were nearly surrounded by ice  which closed in the ship on all sides  scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated.
Frankenstein,our situation was somewhat dangerous  especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.
Frankenstein,we accordingly lay to  hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
Frankenstein,about two o   clock the mist cleared away  and we beheld  stretched out in every direction  vast and irregular plains of ice  which seemed to have no end.
Frankenstein,some of my comrades groaned  and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts  when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.
Frankenstein,we perceived a low carriage  fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs  pass on towards the north  at the distance of half a mile  a being which had the shape of a man  but apparently of gigantic stature  sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.
Frankenstein,we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.
Frankenstein,this appearance excited our unqualified wonder.
Frankenstein,we were  as we believed  many hundred miles from any land  but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not  in reality  so distant as we had supposed.
Frankenstein,shut in  however  by ice  it was impossible to follow his track  which we had observed with the greatest attention.
Frankenstein,about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea  and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.
Frankenstein,we  however  lay to until the morning  fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.
Frankenstein,i profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
Frankenstein,in the morning  however  as soon as it was light  i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel  apparently talking to someone in the sea.
Frankenstein,it was  in fact  a sledge  like that we had seen before  which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.
Frankenstein,only one dog remained alive  but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
Frankenstein,he was not  as the other traveller seemed to be  a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island  but a european.
Frankenstein,when i appeared on deck the master said     here is our captain  and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.
Frankenstein,on perceiving me  the stranger addressed me in english  although with a foreign accent.
Frankenstein,before i come on board your vessel    said he     will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound     you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.
Frankenstein,i replied  however  that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.
Frankenstein,upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
Frankenstein,good god  margaret  if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety  your surprise would have been boundless.
Frankenstein,his limbs were nearly frozen  and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.
Frankenstein,i never saw a man in so wretched a condition.
Frankenstein,we attempted to carry him into the cabin  but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.
Frankenstein,we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
Frankenstein,as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.
Frankenstein,by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup  which restored him wonderfully.
Frankenstein,two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak  and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.
Frankenstein,when he had in some measure recovered  i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.
Frankenstein,i never saw a more interesting creature  his eyes have generally an expression of wildness  and even madness  but there are moments when  if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service  his whole countenance is lighted up  as it were  with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled.
Frankenstein,but he is generally melancholy and despairing  and sometimes he gnashes his teeth  as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
Frankenstein,when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men  who wished to ask him a thousand questions  but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity  in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Frankenstein,once  however  the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.
Frankenstein,his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom  and he replied     to seek one who fled from me.
Frankenstein,and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion        yes.
Frankenstein,then i fancy we have seen him  for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge  with a man in it  across the ice.
Frankenstein,this aroused the stranger   s attention  and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the d  mon  as he called him  had pursued.
Frankenstein,soon after  when he was alone with me  he said     i have  doubtless  excited your curiosity  as well as that of these good people  but you are too considerate to make inquiries.
Frankenstein,certainly  it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.
Frankenstein,and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation  you have benevolently restored me to life.
Frankenstein,soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.
Frankenstein,i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty  for the ice had not broken until near midnight  and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time  but of this i could not judge.
Frankenstein,from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.
Frankenstein,he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared  but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin  for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
Frankenstein,i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.
Frankenstein,such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.
Frankenstein,the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Frankenstein,yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him  although they have had very little communication with him.
Frankenstein,for my own part  i begin to love him as a brother  and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.
Frankenstein,he must have been a noble creature in his better days  being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.
Frankenstein,i said in one of my letters  my dear margaret  that i should find no friend on the wide ocean  yet i have found a man who  before his spirit had been broken by misery  i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.
Frankenstein,i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals  should i have any fresh incidents to record.
Frankenstein,my affection for my guest increases every day.
Frankenstein,he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.
Frankenstein,how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief  he is so gentle  yet so wise  his mind is so cultivated  and when he speaks  although his words are culled with the choicest art  yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
Frankenstein,he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck  apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.
Frankenstein,yet  although unhappy  he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.
Frankenstein,he has frequently conversed with me on mine  which i have communicated to him without disguise.
Frankenstein,he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it.
Frankenstein,i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart  to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say  with all the fervour that warmed me  how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune  my existence  my every hope  to the furtherance of my enterprise.
Frankenstein,one man   s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought  for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.
Frankenstein,as i spoke  a dark gloom spread over my listener   s countenance.
Frankenstein,at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion  he placed his hands before his eyes  and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers  a groan burst from his heaving breast.
Frankenstein,i paused  at length he spoke  in broken accents     unhappy man  do you share my madness  have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught  hear me  let me reveal my tale  and you will dash the cup from your lips     such words  you may imagine  strongly excited my curiosity  but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers  and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.
Frankenstein,having conquered the violence of his feelings  he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion  and quelling the dark tyranny of despair  he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.
Frankenstein,he asked me the history of my earlier years.
Frankenstein,the tale was quickly told  but it awakened various trains of reflection.
Frankenstein,i spoke of my desire of finding a friend  of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot  and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
Frankenstein,i agree with you    replied the stranger     we are unfashioned creatures  but half made up  if one wiser  better  dearer than ourselves   such a friend ought to be   do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.
Frankenstein,i once had a friend  the most noble of human creatures  and am entitled  therefore  to judge respecting friendship.
Frankenstein,you have hope  and the world before you  and have no cause for despair.
Frankenstein,but i   i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.
Frankenstein,as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm  settled grief that touched me to the heart.
Frankenstein,but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.
Frankenstein,even broken in spirit as he is  no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.
Frankenstein,the starry sky  the sea  and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.
Frankenstein,such a man has a double existence  he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments  yet when he has retired into himself  he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him  within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
Frankenstein,will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer  you would not if you saw him.
Frankenstein,you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world  and you are therefore somewhat fastidious  but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.
Frankenstein,sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew.
Frankenstein,i believe it to be an intuitive discernment  a quick but never failing power of judgment  a penetration into the causes of things  unequalled for clearness and precision  add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul subduing music.
Frankenstein,yesterday the stranger said to me     you may easily perceive  captain walton  that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.
Frankenstein,i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me  but you have won me to alter my determination.
Frankenstein,you seek for knowledge and wisdom  as i once did  and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you  as mine has been.
Frankenstein,i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you  yet  when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course  exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am  i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale  one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.
Frankenstein,prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.
Frankenstein,were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief  perhaps your ridicule  but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever varied powers of nature  nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.
Frankenstein,you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication  yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.
Frankenstein,i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative  partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.
Frankenstein,i expressed these feelings in my answer.
Frankenstein,i thank you    he replied     for your sympathy  but it is useless  my fate is nearly fulfilled.
Frankenstein,i wait but for one event  and then i shall repose in peace.
Frankenstein,i understand your feeling    continued he  perceiving that i wished to interrupt him     but you are mistaken  my friend  if thus you will allow me to name you  nothing can alter my destiny  listen to my history  and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.
Frankenstein,he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure.
Frankenstein,this promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
Frankenstein,i have resolved every night  when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties  to record  as nearly as possible in his own words  what he has related during the day.
Frankenstein,if i should be engaged  i will at least make notes.
Frankenstein,this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure  but to me  who know him  and who hear it from his own lips   with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day  even now  as i commence my task  his full toned voice swells in my ears  his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness  i see his thin hand raised in animation  while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.
Frankenstein,strange and harrowing must be his story  frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it   thus
Frankenstein, i am by birth a genevese  and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.
Frankenstein,my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics  and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
Frankenstein,he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.
Frankenstein,he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country  a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early  nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.
Frankenstein,as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character  i cannot refrain from relating them.
Frankenstein,one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who  from a flourishing state  fell  through numerous mischances  into poverty.
Frankenstein,this man  whose name was beaufort  was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.
Frankenstein,having paid his debts  therefore  in the most honourable manner  he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne  where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.
Frankenstein,my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
Frankenstein,he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.
Frankenstein,he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out  with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.
Frankenstein,beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself  and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.
Frankenstein,overjoyed at this discovery  he hastened to the house  which was situated in a mean street near the reuss.
Frankenstein,but when he entered  misery and despair alone welcomed him.
Frankenstein,beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes  but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months  and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant   s house.
Frankenstein,the interval was  consequently  spent in inaction  his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection  and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness  incapable of any exertion.
Frankenstein,his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness  but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.
Frankenstein,but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould  and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.
Frankenstein,she procured plain work  she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
Frankenstein,several months passed in this manner.
Frankenstein,her father grew worse  her time was more entirely occupied in attending him  her means of subsistence decreased  and in the tenth month her father died in her arms  leaving her an orphan and a beggar.
Frankenstein,this last blow overcame her  and she knelt by beaufort   s coffin weeping bitterly  when my father entered the chamber.
Frankenstein,he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl  who committed herself to his care  and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.
Frankenstein,two years after this event caroline became his wife.
Frankenstein,there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents  but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
Frankenstein,there was a sense of justice in my father   s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.
Frankenstein,perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.
Frankenstein,there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother  differing wholly from the doting fondness of age  for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of  in some degree  recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured  but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.
Frankenstein,everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.
Frankenstein,he strove to shelter her  as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener  from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.
Frankenstein,her health  and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit  had been shaken by what she had gone through.
Frankenstein,during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions  and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy  and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders  as a restorative for her weakened frame.
Frankenstein,from italy they visited germany and france.
Frankenstein,i  their eldest child  was born at naples  and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.
Frankenstein,i remained for several years their only child.
Frankenstein,much as they were attached to each other  they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.
Frankenstein,my mother   s tender caresses and my father   s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
Frankenstein,i was their plaything and their idol  and something better   their child  the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven  whom to bring up to good  and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery  according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.
Frankenstein,with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life  added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both  it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience  of charity  and of self control  i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.
Frankenstein,for a long time i was their only care.
Frankenstein,my mother had much desired to have a daughter  but i continued their single offspring.
Frankenstein,when i was about five years old  while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy  they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como.
Frankenstein,their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.
Frankenstein,this  to my mother  was more than a duty  it was a necessity  a passion   remembering what she had suffered  and how she had been relieved   for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.
Frankenstein,during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate  while the number of half clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.
Frankenstein,one day  when my father had gone by himself to milan  my mother  accompanied by me  visited this abode.
Frankenstein,she found a peasant and his wife  hard working  bent down by care and labour  distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.
Frankenstein,among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.
Frankenstein,she appeared of a different stock.
Frankenstein,the four others were dark eyed  hardy little vagrants  this child was thin and very fair.
Frankenstein,her hair was the brightest living gold  and despite the poverty of her clothing  seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.
Frankenstein,her brow was clear and ample  her blue eyes cloudless  and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species  a being heaven sent  and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
Frankenstein,the peasant woman  perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl  eagerly communicated her history.
Frankenstein,she was not her child  but the daughter of a milanese nobleman.
Frankenstein,her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth.
Frankenstein,the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse  they were better off then.
Frankenstein,they had not been long married  and their eldest child was but just born.
Frankenstein,the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy   one among the schiavi ognor frementi  who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.
Frankenstein,he became the victim of its weakness.
Frankenstein,whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known.
Frankenstein,his property was confiscated  his child became an orphan and a beggar.
Frankenstein,she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode  fairer than a garden rose among dark leaved brambles.
Frankenstein,when my father returned from milan  he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub   a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.
Frankenstein,the apparition was soon explained.
Frankenstein,with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.
Frankenstein,they were fond of the sweet orphan.
Frankenstein,her presence had seemed a blessing to them  but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection.
Frankenstein,they consulted their village priest  and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents    house   my more than sister   the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.
Frankenstein,everyone loved elizabeth.
Frankenstein,the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became  while i shared it  my pride and my delight.
Frankenstein,on the evening previous to her being brought to my home  my mother had said playfully     i have a pretty present for my victor   tomorrow he shall have it.
Frankenstein,and when  on the morrow  she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift  i  with childish seriousness  interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine   mine to protect  love  and cherish.
Frankenstein,all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own.
Frankenstein,we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.
Frankenstein,no word  no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me   my more than sister  since till death she was to be mine only.
Frankenstein,we were brought up together  there was not quite a year difference in our ages.
Frankenstein,i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.
Frankenstein,harmony was the soul of our companionship  and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.
Frankenstein,elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition  but  with all my ardour  i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
Frankenstein,she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets  and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home    the sublime shapes of the mountains  the changes of the seasons  tempest and calm  the silence of winter  and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers   she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
Frankenstein,while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things  i delighted in investigating their causes.
Frankenstein,the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine.
Frankenstein,curiosity  earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature  gladness akin to rapture  as they were unfolded to me  are among the earliest sensations i can remember.
Frankenstein,on the birth of a second son  my junior by seven years  my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.
Frankenstein,we possessed a house in geneva  and a campagne on belrive  the eastern shore of the lake  at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.
Frankenstein,we resided principally in the latter  and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.
Frankenstein,it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.
Frankenstein,i was indifferent  therefore  to my school fellows in general  but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.
Frankenstein,henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva.
Frankenstein,he was a boy of singular talent and fancy.
Frankenstein,he loved enterprise  hardship  and even danger for its own sake.
Frankenstein,he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.
Frankenstein,he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.
Frankenstein,he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades  in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles  of the round table of king arthur  and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
Frankenstein,no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.
Frankenstein,my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
Frankenstein,we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice  but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.
Frankenstein,when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was  and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.
Frankenstein,my temper was sometimes violent  and my passions vehement  but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn  and not to learn all things indiscriminately.
Frankenstein,i confess that neither the structure of languages  nor the code of governments  nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.
Frankenstein,it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn  and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me  still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical  or in its highest sense  the physical secrets of the world.
Frankenstein,meanwhile clerval occupied himself  so to speak  with the moral relations of things.
Frankenstein,the busy stage of life  the virtues of heroes  and the actions of men were his theme  and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.
Frankenstein,the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
Frankenstein,her sympathy was ours  her smile  her soft voice  the sweet glance of her celestial eyes  were ever there to bless and animate us.
Frankenstein,she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract  i might have become sullen in my study  rough through the ardour of my nature  but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.
Frankenstein,and clerval   could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval  yet he might not have been so perfectly humane  so thoughtful in his generosity  so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit  had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.
Frankenstein,i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood  before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.
Frankenstein,besides  in drawing the picture of my early days  i also record those events which led  by insensible steps  to my after tale of misery  for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise  like a mountain river  from ignoble and almost forgotten sources  but  swelling as it proceeded  it became the torrent which  in its course  has swept away all my hopes and joys.
Frankenstein,natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate  i desire  therefore  in this narration  to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.
Frankenstein,when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon  the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.
Frankenstein,in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa.
Frankenstein,i opened it with apathy  the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.
Frankenstein,a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind  and bounding with joy  i communicated my discovery to my father.
Frankenstein,my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said     ah  cornelius agrippa  my dear victor  do not waste your time upon this  it is sad trash.
Frankenstein,if  instead of this remark  my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient  because the powers of the latter were chimerical  while those of the former were real and practical  under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination  warmed as it was  by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.
Frankenstein,it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
Frankenstein,but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents  and i continued to read with the greatest avidity.
Frankenstein,when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author  and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus.
Frankenstein,i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight  they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.
Frankenstein,i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.
Frankenstein,in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers  i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
Frankenstein,sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.
Frankenstein,those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boy   s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
Frankenstein,the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.
Frankenstein,the most learned philosopher knew little more.
Frankenstein,he had partially unveiled the face of nature  but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.
Frankenstein,he might dissect  anatomise  and give names  but  not to speak of a final cause  causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.
Frankenstein,i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature  and rashly and ignorantly i had repined.
Frankenstein,but here were books  and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.
Frankenstein,i took their word for all that they averred  and i became their disciple.
Frankenstein,it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century  but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva  i was  to a great degree  self taught with regard to my favourite studies.
Frankenstein,my father was not scientific  and i was left to struggle with a child   s blindness  added to a student   s thirst for knowledge.
Frankenstein,under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher   s stone and the elixir of life  but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.
Frankenstein,wealth was an inferior object  but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death   nor were these my only visions.
Frankenstein,the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors  the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought  and if my incantations were always unsuccessful  i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.
Frankenstein,and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems  mingling  like an unadept  a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge  guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning  till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.
Frankenstein,when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive  when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.
Frankenstein,it advanced from behind the mountains of jura  and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.
Frankenstein,i remained  while the storm lasted  watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
Frankenstein,as i stood at the door  on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house  and so soon as the dazzling light vanished  the oak had disappeared  and nothing remained but a blasted stump.
Frankenstein,when we visited it the next morning  we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.
Frankenstein,it was not splintered by the shock  but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.
Frankenstein,i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
Frankenstein,before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.
Frankenstein,on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us  and excited by this catastrophe  he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism  which was at once new and astonishing to me.
Frankenstein,all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa  albertus magnus  and paracelsus  the lords of my imagination  but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.
Frankenstein,it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.
Frankenstein,all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
Frankenstein,by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth  i at once gave up my former occupations  set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation  and entertained the greatest disdain for a would be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.
Frankenstein,in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations  and so worthy of my consideration.
Frankenstein,thus strangely are our souls constructed  and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.
Frankenstein,when i look back  it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life   the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.
Frankenstein,her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.
Frankenstein,it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution  happiness with their disregard.
Frankenstein,it was a strong effort of the spirit of good  but it was ineffectual.
Frankenstein,destiny was too potent  and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.
Frankenstein,when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva  but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.
Frankenstein,my departure was therefore fixed at an early date  but before the day resolved upon could arrive  the first misfortune of my life occurred   an omen  as it were  of my future misery.
Frankenstein,elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever  her illness was severe  and she was in the greatest danger.
Frankenstein,during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.
Frankenstein,she had at first yielded to our entreaties  but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced  she could no longer control her anxiety.
Frankenstein,she attended her sickbed  her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper   elizabeth was saved  but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.
Frankenstein,on the third day my mother sickened  her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms  and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.
Frankenstein,on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.
Frankenstein,she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself.
Frankenstein,my children    she said     my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.
Frankenstein,this expectation will now be the consolation of your father.
Frankenstein,elizabeth  my love  you must supply my place to my younger children.
Frankenstein,alas  i regret that i am taken from you  and  happy and beloved as i have been  is it not hard to quit you all  but these are not thoughts befitting me  i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.
Frankenstein,she died calmly  and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
Frankenstein,i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil  the void that presents itself to the soul  and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.
Frankenstein,it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever   that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed  never more to be heard.
Frankenstein,these are the reflections of the first days  but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil  then the actual bitterness of grief commences.
Frankenstein,yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection  and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt  and must feel  the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity  and the smile that plays upon the lips  although it may be deemed a sacrilege  is not banished.
Frankenstein,my mother was dead  but we had still duties which we ought to perform  we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.
Frankenstein,my departure for ingolstadt  which had been deferred by these events  was now again determined upon.
Frankenstein,i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.
Frankenstein,it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose  akin to death  of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.
Frankenstein,i was new to sorrow  but it did not the less alarm me.
Frankenstein,i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me  and above all  i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled.
Frankenstein,she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
Frankenstein,she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
Frankenstein,she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.
Frankenstein,never was she so enchanting as at this time  when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
Frankenstein,she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
Frankenstein,the day of my departure at length arrived.
Frankenstein,clerval spent the last evening with us.
Frankenstein,he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student  but in vain.
Frankenstein,his father was a narrow minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
Frankenstein,henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.
Frankenstein,he said little  but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
Frankenstein,we sat late.
Frankenstein,we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word    farewell    it was said  and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose  each fancying that the other was deceived  but when at morning   s dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away  they were all there   my father again to bless me  clerval to press my hand once more  my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
Frankenstein,i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.
Frankenstein,i  who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions  continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure   i was now alone.
Frankenstein,in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector.
Frankenstein,my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic  and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.
Frankenstein,i loved my brothers  elizabeth  and clerval  these were    old familiar faces    but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.
Frankenstein,such were my reflections as i commenced my journey  but as i proceeded  my spirits and hopes rose.
Frankenstein,i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.
Frankenstein,i had often  when at home  thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
Frankenstein,now my desires were complied with  and it would  indeed  have been folly to repent.
Frankenstein,i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt  which was long and fatiguing.
Frankenstein,at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.
Frankenstein,i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased.
Frankenstein,the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.
Frankenstein,chance   or rather the evil influence  the angel of destruction  which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father   s door   led me first to m. krempe  professor of natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,he was an uncouth man  but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.
Frankenstein,he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,i replied carelessly  and partly in contempt  mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied.
Frankenstein,the professor stared.
Frankenstein,have you    he said     really spent your time in studying such nonsense     i replied in the affirmative.
Frankenstein,every minute    continued m. krempe with warmth     every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.
Frankenstein,you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.
Frankenstein,good god  in what desert land have you lived  where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient  i little expected  in this enlightened and scientific age  to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus.
Frankenstein,my dear sir  you must begin your studies entirely anew.
Frankenstein,so saying  he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure  and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations  and that m. waldman  a fellow professor  would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.
Frankenstein,i returned home not disappointed  for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated  but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.
Frankenstein,m. krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance  the teacher  therefore  did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.
Frankenstein,in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain  perhaps  i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years.
Frankenstein,as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
Frankenstein,with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters  i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
Frankenstein,besides  i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power  such views  although futile  were grand  but now the scene was changed.
Frankenstein,the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.
Frankenstein,i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
Frankenstein,such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt  which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.
Frankenstein,but as the ensuing week commenced  i thought of the information which m. krempe had given me concerning the lectures.
Frankenstein,and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit  i recollected what he had said of m. waldman  whom i had never seen  as he had hitherto been out of town.
Frankenstein,partly from curiosity and partly from idleness  i went into the lecturing room  which m. waldman entered shortly after.
Frankenstein,this professor was very unlike his colleague.
Frankenstein,he appeared about fifty years of age  but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence  a few grey hairs covered his temples  but those at the back of his head were nearly black.
Frankenstein,his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard.
Frankenstein,he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning  pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
Frankenstein,he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.
Frankenstein,after having made a few preparatory experiments  he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry  the terms of which i shall never forget      the ancient teachers of this science    said he     promised impossibilities and performed nothing.
Frankenstein,the modern masters promise very little  they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers  whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt  and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible  have indeed performed miracles.
Frankenstein,they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding places.
Frankenstein,they ascend into the heavens  they have discovered how the blood circulates  and the nature of the air we breathe.
Frankenstein,they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers  they can command the thunders of heaven  mimic the earthquake  and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Frankenstein,such were the professor   s words   rather let me say such the words of the fate   enounced to destroy me.
Frankenstein,as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy  one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being  chord after chord was sounded  and soon my mind was filled with one thought  one conception  one purpose.
Frankenstein,so much has been done  exclaimed the soul of frankenstein   more  far more  will i achieve  treading in the steps already marked  i will pioneer a new way  explore unknown powers  and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
Frankenstein,i closed not my eyes that night.
Frankenstein,my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil  i felt that order would thence arise  but i had no power to produce it.
Frankenstein,by degrees  after the morning   s dawn  sleep came.
Frankenstein,i awoke  and my yesternight   s thoughts were as a dream.
Frankenstein,there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent.
Frankenstein,on the same day i paid m. waldman a visit.
Frankenstein,his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public  for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
Frankenstein,i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor.
Frankenstein,he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus  but without the contempt that m. krempe had exhibited.
Frankenstein,he said that    these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.
Frankenstein,they had left to us  as an easier task  to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
Frankenstein,the labours of men of genius  however erroneously directed  scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.
Frankenstein,i listened to his statement  which was delivered without any presumption or affectation  and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists  i expressed myself in measured terms  with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor  without letting escape  inexperience in life would have made me ashamed  any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.
Frankenstein,i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure.
Frankenstein,i am happy    said m. waldman     to have gained a disciple  and if your application equals your ability  i have no doubt of your success.
Frankenstein,chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made  it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study  but at the same time  i have not neglected the other branches of science.
Frankenstein,a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.
Frankenstein,if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist  i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy  including mathematics.
Frankenstein,he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines  instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.
Frankenstein,he also gave me the list of books which i had requested  and i took my leave.
Frankenstein,thus ended a day memorable to me  it decided my future destiny.
Frankenstein,from this day natural philosophy  and particularly chemistry  in the most comprehensive sense of the term  became nearly my sole occupation.
Frankenstein,i read with ardour those works  so full of genius and discrimination  which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.
Frankenstein,i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university  and i found even in m. krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information  combined  it is true  with a repulsive physiognomy and manners  but not on that account the less valuable.
Frankenstein,in m. waldman i found a true friend.
Frankenstein,his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism  and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.
Frankenstein,in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
Frankenstein,my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain  it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory.
Frankenstein,as i applied so closely  it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.
Frankenstein,my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students  and my proficiency that of the masters.
Frankenstein,professor krempe often asked me  with a sly smile  how cornelius agrippa went on  whilst m. waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
Frankenstein,two years passed in this manner  during which i paid no visit to geneva  but was engaged  heart and soul  in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make.
Frankenstein,none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
Frankenstein,in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you  and there is nothing more to know  but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
Frankenstein,a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study  and i  who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this  improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments  which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.
Frankenstein,when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt  my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements  i thought of returning to my friends and my native town  when an incident happened that protracted my stay.
Frankenstein,one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame  and  indeed  any animal endued with life.
Frankenstein,whence  i often asked myself  did the principle of life proceed  it was a bold question  and one which has ever been considered as a mystery  yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted  if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.
Frankenstein,i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.
Frankenstein,unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm  my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.
Frankenstein,to examine the causes of life  we must first have recourse to death.
Frankenstein,i became acquainted with the science of anatomy  but this was not sufficient  i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
Frankenstein,in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.
Frankenstein,i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.
Frankenstein,darkness had no effect upon my fancy  and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life  which  from being the seat of beauty and strength  had become food for the worm.
Frankenstein,now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses.
Frankenstein,my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.
Frankenstein,i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted  i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life  i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.
Frankenstein,i paused  examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation  as exemplified in the change from life to death  and death to life  until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me   a light so brilliant and wondrous  yet so simple  that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated  i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science  that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.
Frankenstein,remember  i am not recording the vision of a madman.
Frankenstein,the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true.
Frankenstein,some miracle might have produced it  yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.
Frankenstein,after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue  i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life  nay  more  i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
Frankenstein,the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.
Frankenstein,after so much time spent in painful labour  to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.
Frankenstein,but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated  and i beheld only the result.
Frankenstein,what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.
Frankenstein,not that  like a magic scene  it all opened upon me at once  the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.
Frankenstein,i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life  aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.
Frankenstein,i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express  my friend  that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted  that cannot be  listen patiently until the end of my story  and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject.
Frankenstein,i will not lead you on  unguarded and ardent as i then was  to your destruction and infallible misery.
Frankenstein,learn from me  if not by my precepts  at least by my example  how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world  than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
Frankenstein,when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands  i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it.
Frankenstein,although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation  yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it  with all its intricacies of fibres  muscles  and veins  still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.
Frankenstein,i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself  or one of simpler organization  but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.
Frankenstein,the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking  but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed.
Frankenstein,i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses  my operations might be incessantly baffled  and at last my work be imperfect  yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics  i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.
Frankenstein,nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
Frankenstein,it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being.
Frankenstein,as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed  i resolved  contrary to my first intention  to make the being of a gigantic stature  that is to say  about eight feet in height  and proportionably large.
Frankenstein,after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials  i began.
Frankenstein,no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards  like a hurricane  in the first enthusiasm of success.
Frankenstein,life and death appeared to me ideal bounds  which i should first break through  and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.
Frankenstein,a new species would bless me as its creator and source  many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
Frankenstein,no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs.
Frankenstein,pursuing these reflections  i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter  i might in process of time  although i now found it impossible  renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
Frankenstein,these thoughts supported my spirits  while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.
Frankenstein,my cheek had grown pale with study  and my person had become emaciated with confinement.
Frankenstein,sometimes  on the very brink of certainty  i failed  yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.
Frankenstein,one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself  and the moon gazed on my midnight labours  while  with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness  i pursued nature to her hiding places.
Frankenstein,who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay  my limbs now tremble  and my eyes swim with the remembrance  but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward  i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.
Frankenstein,it was indeed but a passing trance  that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as  the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate  i had returned to my old habits.
Frankenstein,i collected bones from charnel houses and disturbed  with profane fingers  the tremendous secrets of the human frame.
Frankenstein,in a solitary chamber  or rather cell  at the top of the house  and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase  i kept my workshop of filthy creation  my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.
Frankenstein,the dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials  and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation  whilst  still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased  i brought my work near to a conclusion.
Frankenstein,the summer months passed while i was thus engaged  heart and soul  in one pursuit.
Frankenstein,it was a most beautiful season  never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage  but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.
Frankenstein,and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent  and whom i had not seen for so long a time.
Frankenstein,i knew my silence disquieted them  and i well remembered the words of my father     i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection  and we shall hear regularly from you.
Frankenstein,you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.
Frankenstein,i knew well therefore what would be my father   s feelings  but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment  loathsome in itself  but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.
Frankenstein,i wished  as it were  to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object  which swallowed up every habit of my nature  should be completed.
Frankenstein,i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part  but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame.
Frankenstein,a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
Frankenstein,i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
Frankenstein,if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix  then that study is certainly unlawful  that is to say  not befitting the human mind.
Frankenstein,if this rule were always observed  if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections  greece had not been enslaved  c  sar would have spared his country  america would have been discovered more gradually  and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed.
Frankenstein,but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale  and your looks remind me to proceed.
Frankenstein,my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
Frankenstein,winter  spring  and summer passed away during my labours  but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves   sights which before always yielded me supreme delight   so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation.
Frankenstein,the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close  and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded.
Frankenstein,but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety  and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines  or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
Frankenstein,every night i was oppressed by a slow fever  and i became nervous to a most painful degree  the fall of a leaf startled me  and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime.
Frankenstein,sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become  the energy of my purpose alone sustained me  my labours would soon end  and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease  and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.
Frankenstein,it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
Frankenstein,with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony  i collected the instruments of life around me  that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.
Frankenstein,it was already one in the morning  the rain pattered dismally against the panes  and my candle was nearly burnt out  when  by the glimmer of the half extinguished light  i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open  it breathed hard  and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
Frankenstein,how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe  or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form  his limbs were in proportion  and i had selected his features as beautiful.
Frankenstein,beautiful  great god  his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath  his hair was of a lustrous black  and flowing  his teeth of a pearly whiteness  but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes  that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set  his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
Frankenstein,the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
Frankenstein,i had worked hard for nearly two years  for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.
Frankenstein,for this i had deprived myself of rest and health.
Frankenstein,i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation  but now that i had finished  the beauty of the dream vanished  and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
Frankenstein,unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created  i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber  unable to compose my mind to sleep.
Frankenstein,at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured  and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes  endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
Frankenstein,but it was in vain  i slept  indeed  but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams.
Frankenstein,i thought i saw elizabeth  in the bloom of health  walking in the streets of ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,delighted and surprised  i embraced her  but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips  they became livid with the hue of death  her features appeared to change  and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms  a shroud enveloped her form  and i saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
Frankenstein,i started from my sleep with horror  a cold dew covered my forehead  my teeth chattered  and every limb became convulsed  when  by the dim and yellow light of the moon  as it forced its way through the window shutters  i beheld the wretch   the miserable monster whom i had created.
Frankenstein,he held up the curtain of the bed  and his eyes  if eyes they may be called  were fixed on me.
Frankenstein,his jaws opened  and he muttered some inarticulate sounds  while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.
Frankenstein,he might have spoken  but i did not hear  one hand was stretched out  seemingly to detain me  but i escaped and rushed downstairs.
Frankenstein,i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited  where i remained during the rest of the night  walking up and down in the greatest agitation  listening attentively  catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life.
Frankenstein,oh  no mortal could support the horror of that countenance.
Frankenstein,a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.
Frankenstein,i had gazed on him while unfinished  he was ugly then  but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion  it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived.
Frankenstein,i passed the night wretchedly.
Frankenstein,sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery  at others  i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.
Frankenstein,mingled with this horror  i felt the bitterness of disappointment  dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me  and the change was so rapid  the overthrow so complete   morning  dismal and wet  at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt  its white steeple and clock  which indicated the sixth hour.
Frankenstein,the porter opened the gates of the court  which had that night been my asylum  and i issued into the streets  pacing them with quick steps  as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view.
Frankenstein,i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited  but felt impelled to hurry on  although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
Frankenstein,i continued walking in this manner for some time  endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.
Frankenstein,i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing.
Frankenstein,my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear  and i hurried on with irregular steps  not daring to look about me   like one who  on a lonely road  doth walk in fear and dread  and  having once turned round  walks on  and turns no more his head  because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread.
Frankenstein,coleridge   s    ancient mariner.
Frankenstein,continuing thus  i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.
Frankenstein,here i paused  i knew not why  but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.
Frankenstein,as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence  it stopped just where i was standing  and on the door being opened  i perceived henry clerval  who  on seeing me  instantly sprung out.
Frankenstein,my dear frankenstein    exclaimed he     how glad i am to see you  how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting     nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval  his presence brought back to my thoughts my father  elizabeth  and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
Frankenstein,i grasped his hand  and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune  i felt suddenly  and for the first time during many months  calm and serene joy.
Frankenstein,i welcomed my friend  therefore  in the most cordial manner  and we walked towards my college.
Frankenstein,clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,you may easily believe    said he     how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book keeping  and  indeed  i believe i left him incredulous to the last  for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield     i have ten thousand florins a year without greek  i eat heartily without greek.
Frankenstein,but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning  and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.
Frankenstein,it gives me the greatest delight to see you  but tell me how you left my father  brothers  and elizabeth.
Frankenstein,very well  and very happy  only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.
Frankenstein,by the by  i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.
Frankenstein,but  my dear frankenstein    continued he  stopping short and gazing full in my face     i did not before remark how very ill you appear  so thin and pale  you look as if you had been watching for several nights.
Frankenstein,you have guessed right  i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest  as you see  but i hope  i sincerely hope  that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free.
Frankenstein,i trembled excessively  i could not endure to think of  and far less to allude to  the occurrences of the preceding night.
Frankenstein,i walked with a quick pace  and we soon arrived at my college.
Frankenstein,i then reflected  and the thought made me shiver  that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there  alive and walking about.
Frankenstein,i dreaded to behold this monster  but i feared still more that henry should see him.
Frankenstein,entreating him  therefore  to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs  i darted up towards my own room.
Frankenstein,my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself.
Frankenstein,i then paused  and a cold shivering came over me.
Frankenstein,i threw the door forcibly open  as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side  but nothing appeared.
Frankenstein,i stepped fearfully in  the apartment was empty  and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.
Frankenstein,i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me  but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled  i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval.
Frankenstein,we ascended into my room  and the servant presently brought breakfast  but i was unable to contain myself.
Frankenstein,it was not joy only that possessed me  i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness  and my pulse beat rapidly.
Frankenstein,i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place  i jumped over the chairs  clapped my hands  and laughed aloud.
Frankenstein,clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival  but when he observed me more attentively  he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account  and my loud  unrestrained  heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.
Frankenstein,my dear victor    cried he     what  for god   s sake  is the matter  do not laugh in that manner.
Frankenstein,how ill you are  what is the cause of all this        do not ask me    cried i  putting my hands before my eyes  for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room     he can tell.
Frankenstein,oh  save me  save me    i imagined that the monster seized me  i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
Frankenstein,poor clerval  what must have been his feelings  a meeting  which he anticipated with such joy  so strangely turned to bitterness.
Frankenstein,but i was not the witness of his grief  for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long  long time.
Frankenstein,this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.
Frankenstein,during all that time henry was my only nurse.
Frankenstein,i afterwards learned that  knowing my father   s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey  and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth  he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.
Frankenstein,he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself  and  firm in the hope he felt of my recovery  he did not doubt that  instead of doing harm  he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.
Frankenstein,but i was in reality very ill  and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
Frankenstein,the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes  and i raved incessantly concerning him.
Frankenstein,doubtless my words surprised henry  he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination  but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
Frankenstein,by very slow degrees  and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend  i recovered.
Frankenstein,i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure  i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.
Frankenstein,it was a divine spring  and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.
Frankenstein,i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom  my gloom disappeared  and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion.
Frankenstein,dearest clerval    exclaimed i     how kind  how very good you are to me.
Frankenstein,this whole winter  instead of being spent in study  as you promised yourself  has been consumed in my sick room.
Frankenstein,how shall i ever repay you  i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion  but you will forgive me.
Frankenstein,you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself  but get well as fast as you can  and since you appear in such good spirits  i may speak to you on one subject  may i not     i trembled.
Frankenstein,one subject  what could it be  could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think      compose yourself    said clerval  who observed my change of colour     i will not mention it if it agitates you  but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
Frankenstein,they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.
Frankenstein,is that all  my dear henry  how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear  dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love        if this is your present temper  my friend  you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you  it is from your cousin  i believe.
Frankenstein,clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
Frankenstein,it was from my own elizabeth      my dearest cousin      you have been ill  very ill  and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.
Frankenstein,you are forbidden to write   to hold a pen  yet one word from you  dear victor  is necessary to calm our apprehensions.
Frankenstein,for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line  and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey  yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself  i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse  who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.
Frankenstein,yet that is over now  clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.
Frankenstein,i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
Frankenstein,get well   and return to us.
Frankenstein,you will find a happy  cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.
Frankenstein,your father   s health is vigorous  and he asks but to see you  but to be assured that you are well  and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
Frankenstein,how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest  he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.
Frankenstein,he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service  but we cannot part with him  at least until his elder brother returns to us.
Frankenstein,my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country  but ernest never had your powers of application.
Frankenstein,he looks upon study as an odious fetter  his time is spent in the open air  climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.
Frankenstein,i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
Frankenstein,little alteration  except the growth of our dear children  has taken place since you left us.
Frankenstein,the blue lake and snow clad mountains   they never change  and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.
Frankenstein,my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me  and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy  kind faces around me.
Frankenstein,since you left us  but one change has taken place in our little household.
Frankenstein,do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family  probably you do not  i will relate her history  therefore in a few words.
Frankenstein,madame moritz  her mother  was a widow with four children  of whom justine was the third.
Frankenstein,this girl had always been the favourite of her father  but through a strange perversity  her mother could not endure her  and after the death of m. moritz  treated her very ill. my aunt observed this  and when justine was twelve years of age  prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
Frankenstein,the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.
Frankenstein,hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants  and the lower orders  being neither so poor nor so despised  their manners are more refined and moral.
Frankenstein,a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england.
Frankenstein,justine  thus received in our family  learned the duties of a servant  a condition which  in our fortunate country  does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
Frankenstein,justine  you may remember  was a great favourite of yours  and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour  one glance from justine could dissipate it  for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica   she looked so frank hearted and happy.
Frankenstein,my aunt conceived a great attachment for her  by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.
Frankenstein,this benefit was fully repaid  justine was the most grateful little creature in the world  i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips  but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Frankenstein,although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate  yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.
Frankenstein,she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners  so that even now she often reminds me of her.
Frankenstein,when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine  who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.
Frankenstein,poor justine was very ill  but other trials were reserved for her.
Frankenstein,one by one  her brothers and sister died  and her mother  with the exception of her neglected daughter  was left childless.
Frankenstein,the conscience of the woman was troubled  she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.
Frankenstein,she was a roman catholic  and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.
Frankenstein,accordingly  a few months after your departure for ingolstadt  justine was called home by her repentant mother.
Frankenstein,poor girl  she wept when she quitted our house  she was much altered since the death of my aunt  grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners  which had before been remarkable for vivacity.
Frankenstein,nor was her residence at her mother   s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.
Frankenstein,the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
Frankenstein,she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness  but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
Frankenstein,perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline  which at first increased her irritability  but she is now at peace for ever.
Frankenstein,she died on the first approach of cold weather  at the beginning of this last winter.
Frankenstein,justine has just returned to us  and i assure you i love her tenderly.
Frankenstein,she is very clever and gentle  and extremely pretty  as i mentioned before  her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
Frankenstein,i must say also a few words to you  my dear cousin  of little darling william.
Frankenstein,i wish you could see him  he is very tall of his age  with sweet laughing blue eyes  dark eyelashes  and curling hair.
Frankenstein,when he smiles  two little dimples appear on each cheek  which are rosy with health.
Frankenstein,he has already had one or two little wives  but louisa biron is his favourite  a pretty little girl of five years of age.
Frankenstein,now  dear victor  i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva.
Frankenstein,the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman  john melbourne  esq.
Frankenstein,her ugly sister  manon  married m. duvillard  the rich banker  last autumn.
Frankenstein,your favourite schoolfellow  louis manoir  has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva.
Frankenstein,but he has already recovered his spirits  and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman  madame tavernier.
Frankenstein,she is a widow  and much older than manoir  but she is very much admired  and a favourite with everybody.
Frankenstein,i have written myself into better spirits  dear cousin  but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude.
Frankenstein,write  dearest victor    one line   one word will be a blessing to us.
Frankenstein,ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness  his affection  and his many letters  we are sincerely grateful.
Frankenstein,adieu  my cousin  take care of yourself  and  i entreat you  write      elizabeth lavenza.
Frankenstein,geneva  march   th       .
Frankenstein,dear  dear elizabeth    i exclaimed  when i had read her letter     i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.
Frankenstein,i wrote  and this exertion greatly fatigued me  but my convalescence had commenced  and proceeded regularly.
Frankenstein,in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber.
Frankenstein,one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university.
Frankenstein,in doing this  i underwent a kind of rough usage  ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.
Frankenstein,ever since the fatal night  the end of my labours  and the beginning of my misfortunes  i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
Frankenstein,when i was otherwise quite restored to health  the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
Frankenstein,henry saw this  and had removed all my apparatus from my view.
Frankenstein,he had also changed my apartment  for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.
Frankenstein,but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors.
Frankenstein,m. waldman inflicted torture when he praised  with kindness and warmth  the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences.
Frankenstein,he soon perceived that i disliked the subject  but not guessing the real cause  he attributed my feelings to modesty  and changed the subject from my improvement  to the science itself  with a desire  as i evidently saw  of drawing me out.
Frankenstein,what could i do  he meant to please  and he tormented me.
Frankenstein,i felt as if he had placed carefully  one by one  in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.
Frankenstein,i writhed under his words  yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt.
Frankenstein,clerval  whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others  declined the subject  alleging  in excuse  his total ignorance  and the conversation took a more general turn.
Frankenstein,i thanked my friend from my heart  but i did not speak.
Frankenstein,i saw plainly that he was surprised  but he never attempted to draw my secret from me  and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds  yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection  but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
Frankenstein,m. krempe was not equally docile  and in my condition at that time  of almost insupportable sensitiveness  his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman.
Frankenstein,d   n the fellow    cried he     why  m. clerval  i assure you he has outstript us all.
Frankenstein,ay  stare if you please  but it is nevertheless true.
Frankenstein,a youngster who  but a few years ago  believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel  has now set himself at the head of the university  and if he is not soon pulled down  we shall all be out of countenance.
Frankenstein,ay  ay    continued he  observing my face expressive of suffering     m. frankenstein is modest  an excellent quality in a young man.
Frankenstein,young men should be diffident of themselves  you know  m. clerval  i was myself when young  but that wears out in a very short time.
Frankenstein,m. krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself  which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
Frankenstein,clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science  and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.
Frankenstein,he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages  and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.
Frankenstein,resolved to pursue no inglorious career  he turned his eyes toward the east  as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.
Frankenstein,the persian  arabic  and sanskrit languages engaged his attention  and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies.
Frankenstein,idleness had ever been irksome to me  and now that i wished to fly from reflection  and hated my former studies  i felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend  and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.
Frankenstein,i did not  like him  attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects  for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.
Frankenstein,i read merely to understand their meaning  and they well repaid my labours.
Frankenstein,their melancholy is soothing  and their joy elevating  to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.
Frankenstein,when you read their writings  life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses    in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy  and the fire that consumes your own heart.
Frankenstein,how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome   summer passed away in these occupations  and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn  but being delayed by several accidents  winter and snow arrived  the roads were deemed impassable  and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.
Frankenstein,i felt this delay very bitterly  for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.
Frankenstein,my return had only been delayed so long  from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place  before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.
Frankenstein,the winter  however  was spent cheerfully  and although the spring was uncommonly late  when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
Frankenstein,the month of may had already commenced  and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure  when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt  that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited.
Frankenstein,i acceded with pleasure to this proposition  i was fond of exercise  and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country.
Frankenstein,we passed a fortnight in these perambulations  my health and spirits had long been restored  and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed  the natural incidents of our progress  and the conversation of my friend.
Frankenstein,study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures  and rendered me unsocial  but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart  he again taught me to love the aspect of nature  and the cheerful faces of children.
Frankenstein,excellent friend  how sincerely you did love me  and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.
Frankenstein,a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me  until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses  i became the same happy creature who  a few years ago  loved and beloved by all  had no sorrow or care.
Frankenstein,when happy  inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.
Frankenstein,a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
Frankenstein,the present season was indeed divine  the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges  while those of summer were already in bud.
Frankenstein,i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me  notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off  with an invincible burden.
Frankenstein,henry rejoiced in my gaiety  and sincerely sympathised in my feelings  he exerted himself to amuse me  while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.
Frankenstein,the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing  his conversation was full of imagination  and very often  in imitation of the persian and arabic writers  he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.
Frankenstein,at other times he repeated my favourite poems  or drew me out into arguments  which he supported with great ingenuity.
Frankenstein,we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon  the peasants were dancing  and every one we met appeared gay and happy.
Frankenstein,my own spirits were high  and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
Frankenstein, on my return  i found the following letter from my father         my dear victor      you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us  and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines  merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you.
Frankenstein,but that would be a cruel kindness  and i dare not do it.
Frankenstein,what would be your surprise  my son  when you expected a happy and glad welcome  to behold  on the contrary  tears and wretchedness  and how  victor  can i relate our misfortune  absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs  and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son  i wish to prepare you for the woeful news  but i know it is impossible  even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
Frankenstein,william is dead    that sweet child  whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart  who was so gentle  yet so gay  victor  he is murdered      i will not attempt to console you  but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.
Frankenstein,last thursday  may  th   i  my niece  and your two brothers  went to walk in plainpalais.
Frankenstein,the evening was warm and serene  and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.
Frankenstein,it was already dusk before we thought of returning  and then we discovered that william and ernest  who had gone on before  were not to be found.
Frankenstein,we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
Frankenstein,presently ernest came  and enquired if we had seen his brother  he said  that he had been playing with him  that william had run away to hide himself  and that he vainly sought for him  and afterwards waited for a long time  but that he did not return.
Frankenstein,this account rather alarmed us  and we continued to search for him until night fell  when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.
Frankenstein,he was not there.
Frankenstein,we returned again  with torches  for i could not rest  when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself  and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night  elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.
Frankenstein,about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy  whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health  stretched on the grass livid and motionless  the print of the murder   s finger was on his neck.
Frankenstein,he was conveyed home  and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth.
Frankenstein,she was very earnest to see the corpse.
Frankenstein,at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted  and entering the room where it lay  hastily examined the neck of the victim  and clasping her hands exclaimed     o god  i have murdered my darling child         she fainted  and was restored with extreme difficulty.
Frankenstein,when she again lived  it was only to weep and sigh.
Frankenstein,she told me  that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.
Frankenstein,this picture is gone  and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.
Frankenstein,we have no trace of him at present  although our exertions to discover him are unremitted  but they will not restore my beloved william      come  dearest victor  you alone can console elizabeth.
Frankenstein,she weeps continually  and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death  her words pierce my heart.
Frankenstein,we are all unhappy  but will not that be an additional motive for you  my son  to return and be our comforter  your dear mother  alas  victor  i now say  thank god she did not live to witness the cruel  miserable death of her youngest darling      come  victor  not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin  but with feelings of peace and gentleness  that will heal  instead of festering  the wounds of our minds.
Frankenstein,enter the house of mourning  my friend  but with kindness and affection for those who love you  and not with hatred for your enemies.
Frankenstein,your affectionate and afflicted father     alphonse frankenstein.
Frankenstein,geneva  may   th       .
Frankenstein,clerval  who had watched my countenance as i read this letter  was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving news from my friends.
Frankenstein,i threw the letter on the table  and covered my face with my hands.
Frankenstein,my dear frankenstein    exclaimed henry  when he perceived me weep with bitterness     are you always to be unhappy  my dear friend  what has happened     i motioned him to take up the letter  while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.
Frankenstein,tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval  as he read the account of my misfortune.
Frankenstein,i can offer you no consolation  my friend    said he     your disaster is irreparable.
Frankenstein,what do you intend to do        to go instantly to geneva  come with me  henry  to order the horses.
Frankenstein,during our walk  clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation  he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.
Frankenstein,poor william    said he     dear lovely child  he now sleeps with his angel mother  who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty  but must weep over his untimely loss  to die so miserably  to feel the murderer   s grasp  how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence  poor little fellow  one only consolation have we  his friends mourn and weep  but he is at rest.
Frankenstein,the pang is over  his sufferings are at an end for ever.
Frankenstein,a sod covers his gentle form  and he knows no pain.
Frankenstein,he can no longer be a subject for pity  we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.
Frankenstein,clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets  the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude.
Frankenstein,but now  as soon as the horses arrived  i hurried into a cabriolet  and bade farewell to my friend.
Frankenstein,my journey was very melancholy.
Frankenstein,at first i wished to hurry on  for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends  but when i drew near my native town  i slackened my progress.
Frankenstein,i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.
Frankenstein,i passed through scenes familiar to my youth  but which i had not seen for nearly six years.
Frankenstein,how altered every thing might be during that time  one sudden and desolating change had taken place  but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations  which  although they were done more tranquilly  might not be the less decisive.
Frankenstein,fear overcame me  i dared no advance  dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble  although i was unable to define them.
Frankenstein,i remained two days at lausanne  in this painful state of mind.
Frankenstein,i contemplated the lake  the waters were placid  all around was calm  and the snowy mountains     the palaces of nature    were not changed.
Frankenstein,by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me  and i continued my journey towards geneva.
Frankenstein,the road ran by the side of the lake  which became narrower as i approached my native town.
Frankenstein,i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura  and the bright summit of mont blanc.
Frankenstein,i wept like a child.
Frankenstein,dear mountains  my own beautiful lake  how do you welcome your wanderer  your summits are clear  the sky and lake are blue and placid.
Frankenstein,is this to prognosticate peace  or to mock at my unhappiness     i fear  my friend  that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances  but they were days of comparative happiness  and i think of them with pleasure.
Frankenstein,my country  my beloved country  who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams  thy mountains  and  more than all  thy lovely lake   yet  as i drew nearer home  grief and fear again overcame me.
Frankenstein,night also closed around  and when i could hardly see the dark mountains  i felt still more gloomily.
Frankenstein,the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil  and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.
Frankenstein,alas  i prophesied truly  and failed only in one single circumstance  that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded  i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure.
Frankenstein,it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva  the gates of the town were already shut  and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron  a village at the distance of half a league from the city.
Frankenstein,the sky was serene  and  as i was unable to rest  i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered.
Frankenstein,as i could not pass through the town  i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais.
Frankenstein,during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures.
Frankenstein,the storm appeared to approach rapidly  and  on landing  i ascended a low hill  that i might observe its progress.
Frankenstein,it advanced  the heavens were clouded  and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops  but its violence quickly increased.
Frankenstein,i quitted my seat  and walked on  although the darkness and storm increased every minute  and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.
Frankenstein,it was echoed from sal  ve  the juras  and the alps of savoy  vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes  illuminating the lake  making it appear like a vast sheet of fire  then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness  until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.
Frankenstein,the storm  as is often the case in switzerland  appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.
Frankenstein,the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town  over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of cop  t. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes  and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the m  le  a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.
Frankenstein,while i watched the tempest  so beautiful yet terrific  i wandered on with a hasty step.
Frankenstein,this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits  i clasped my hands  and exclaimed aloud     william  dear angel  this is thy funeral  this thy dirge    as i said these words  i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me  i stood fixed  gazing intently  i could not be mistaken.
Frankenstein,a flash of lightning illuminated the object  and discovered its shape plainly to me  its gigantic stature  and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity  instantly informed me that it was the wretch  the filthy d  mon  to whom i had given life.
Frankenstein,what did he there  could he be  i shuddered at the conception  the murderer of my brother  no sooner did that idea cross my imagination  than i became convinced of its truth  my teeth chattered  and i was forced to lean against a tree for support.
Frankenstein,the figure passed me quickly  and i lost it in the gloom.
Frankenstein,nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.
Frankenstein,he was the murderer  i could not doubt it.
Frankenstein,the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
Frankenstein,i thought of pursuing the devil  but it would have been in vain  for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont sal  ve  a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south.
Frankenstein,he soon reached the summit  and disappeared.
Frankenstein,i remained motionless.
Frankenstein,the thunder ceased  but the rain still continued  and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.
Frankenstein,i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget  the whole train of my progress toward the creation  the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside  its departure.
Frankenstein,two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life  and was this his first crime  alas  i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch  whose delight was in carnage and misery  had he not murdered my brother   no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night  which i spent  cold and wet  in the open air.
Frankenstein,but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather  my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
Frankenstein,i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind  and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror  such as the deed which he had now done  nearly in the light of my own vampire  my own spirit let loose from the grave  and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.
Frankenstein,day dawned  and i directed my steps towards the town.
Frankenstein,the gates were open  and i hastened to my father   s house.
Frankenstein,my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer  and cause instant pursuit to be made.
Frankenstein,but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell.
Frankenstein,a being whom i myself had formed  and endued with life  had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.
Frankenstein,i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation  and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.
Frankenstein,i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me  i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.
Frankenstein,besides  the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit  even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.
Frankenstein,and then of what use would be pursuit  who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont sal  ve  these reflections determined me  and i resolved to remain silent.
Frankenstein,it was about five in the morning when i entered my father   s house.
Frankenstein,i told the servants not to disturb the family  and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.
Frankenstein,six years had elapsed  passed in a dream but for one indelible trace  and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt.
Frankenstein,beloved and venerable parent  he still remained to me.
Frankenstein,i gazed on the picture of my mother  which stood over the mantel piece.
Frankenstein,it was an historical subject  painted at my father   s desire  and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair  kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.
Frankenstein,her garb was rustic  and her cheek pale  but there was an air of dignity and beauty  that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.
Frankenstein,below this picture was a miniature of william  and my tears flowed when i looked upon it.
Frankenstein,while i was thus engaged  ernest entered  he had heard me arrive  and hastened to welcome me     welcome  my dearest victor    said he.
Frankenstein,ah  i wish you had come three months ago  and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
Frankenstein,you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate  yet your presence will  i hope  revive our father  who seems sinking under his misfortune  and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self accusations.
Frankenstein,poor william  he was our darling and our pride     tears  unrestrained  fell from my brother   s eyes  a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.
Frankenstein,before  i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home  the reality came on me as a new  and a not less terrible  disaster.
Frankenstein,i tried to calm ernest  i enquired more minutely concerning my father  and here i named my cousin.
Frankenstein,she most of all    said ernest     requires consolation  she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother  and that made her very wretched.
Frankenstein,but since the murderer has been discovered          the murderer discovered  good god  how can that be  who could attempt to pursue him  it is impossible  one might as well try to overtake the winds  or confine a mountain stream with a straw.
Frankenstein,i saw him too  he was free last night        i do not know what you mean    replied my brother  in accents of wonder     but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.
Frankenstein,no one would believe it at first  and even now elizabeth will not be convinced  notwithstanding all the evidence.
Frankenstein,indeed  who would credit that justine moritz  who was so amiable  and fond of all the family  could suddenly become so capable of so frightful  so appalling a crime        justine moritz  poor  poor girl  is she the accused  but it is wrongfully  every one knows that  no one believes it  surely  ernest        no one did at first  but several circumstances came out  that have almost forced conviction upon us  and her own behaviour has been so confused  as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that  i fear  leaves no hope for doubt.
Frankenstein,but she will be tried today  and you will then hear all.
Frankenstein,he then related that  the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered  justine had been taken ill  and confined to her bed for several days.
Frankenstein,during this interval  one of the servants  happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder  had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother  which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.
Frankenstein,the servant instantly showed it to one of the others  who  without saying a word to any of the family  went to a magistrate  and  upon their deposition  justine was apprehended.
Frankenstein,on being charged with the fact  the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.
Frankenstein,this was a strange tale  but it did not shake my faith  and i replied earnestly     you are all mistaken  i know the murderer.
Frankenstein,justine  poor  good justine  is innocent.
Frankenstein,at that instant my father entered.
Frankenstein,i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance  but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully  and  after we had exchanged our mournful greeting  would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster  had not ernest exclaimed     good god  papa  victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william.
Frankenstein,we do also  unfortunately    replied my father     for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly.
Frankenstein,my dear father  you are mistaken  justine is innocent.
Frankenstein,if she is  god forbid that she should suffer as guilty.
Frankenstein,she is to be tried today  and i hope  i sincerely hope  that she will be acquitted.
Frankenstein,this speech calmed me.
Frankenstein,i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine  and indeed every human being  was guiltless of this murder.
Frankenstein,i had no fear  therefore  that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.
Frankenstein,my tale was not one to announce publicly  its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.
Frankenstein,did any one indeed exist  except i  the creator  who would believe  unless his senses convinced him  in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world   we were soon joined by elizabeth.
Frankenstein,time had altered her since i last beheld her  it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.
Frankenstein,there was the same candour  the same vivacity  but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
Frankenstein,she welcomed me with the greatest affection.
Frankenstein,your arrival  my dear cousin    said she     fills me with hope.
Frankenstein,you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine.
Frankenstein,alas  who is safe  if she be convicted of crime  i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own.
Frankenstein,our misfortune is doubly hard to us  we have not only lost that lovely darling boy  but this poor girl  whom i sincerely love  is to be torn away by even a worse fate.
Frankenstein,if she is condemned  i never shall know joy more.
Frankenstein,but she will not  i am sure she will not  and then i shall be happy again  even after the sad death of my little william.
Frankenstein,she is innocent  my elizabeth    said i     and that shall be proved  fear nothing  but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.
Frankenstein,how kind and generous you are  every one else believes in her guilt  and that made me wretched  for i knew that it was impossible  and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.
Frankenstein,she wept.
Frankenstein,dearest niece    said my father     dry your tears.
Frankenstein,if she is  as you believe  innocent  rely on the justice of our laws  and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.
Frankenstein,we passed a few sad hours until eleven o   clock  when the trial was to commence.
Frankenstein,my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses  i accompanied them to the court.
Frankenstein,during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture.
Frankenstein,it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings  one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy  the other far more dreadfully murdered  with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
Frankenstein,justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy  now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave  and i the cause  a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine  but i was absent when it was committed  and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.
Frankenstein,the appearance of justine was calm.
Frankenstein,she was dressed in mourning  and her countenance  always engaging  was rendered  by the solemnity of her feelings  exquisitely beautiful.
Frankenstein,yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble  although gazed on and execrated by thousands  for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.
Frankenstein,she was tranquil  yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained  and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt  she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
Frankenstein,when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.
Frankenstein,a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us  but she quickly recovered herself  and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.
Frankenstein,the trial began  and after the advocate against her had stated the charge  several witnesses were called.
Frankenstein,several strange facts combined against her  which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had.
Frankenstein,she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.
Frankenstein,the woman asked her what she did there  but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.
Frankenstein,she returned to the house about eight o   clock  and when one inquired where she had passed the night  she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.
Frankenstein,when shown the body  she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.
Frankenstein,the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket  and when elizabeth  in a faltering voice  proved that it was the same which  an hour before the child had been missed  she had placed round his neck  a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
Frankenstein,justine was called on for her defence.
Frankenstein,as the trial had proceeded  her countenance had altered.
Frankenstein,surprise  horror  and misery were strongly expressed.
Frankenstein,sometimes she struggled with her tears  but when she was desired to plead  she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.
Frankenstein,god knows    she said     how entirely i am innocent.
Frankenstein,but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me  i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me  and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.
Frankenstein,she then related that  by the permission of elizabeth  she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at ch  ne  a village situated at about a league from geneva.
Frankenstein,on her return  at about nine o   clock  she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.
Frankenstein,she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him  when the gates of geneva were shut  and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage  being unwilling to call up the inhabitants  to whom she was well known.
Frankenstein,most of the night she spent here watching  towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes  some steps disturbed her  and she awoke.
Frankenstein,it was dawn  and she quitted her asylum  that she might again endeavour to find my brother.
Frankenstein,if she had gone near the spot where his body lay  it was without her knowledge.
Frankenstein,that she had been bewildered when questioned by the market woman was not surprising  since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain.
Frankenstein,concerning the picture she could give no account.
Frankenstein,i know    continued the unhappy victim     how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me  but i have no power of explaining it  and when i have expressed my utter ignorance  i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.
Frankenstein,but here also i am checked.
Frankenstein,i believe that i have no enemy on earth  and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
Frankenstein,did the murderer place it there  i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing  or  if i had  why should he have stolen the jewel  to part with it again so soon      i commit my cause to the justice of my judges  yet i see no room for hope.
Frankenstein,i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character  and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt  i must be condemned  although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence.
Frankenstein,several witnesses were called who had known her for many years  and they spoke well of her  but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.
Frankenstein,elizabeth saw even this last resource  her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct  about to fail the accused  when  although violently agitated  she desired permission to address the court.
Frankenstein,i am    said she     the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered  or rather his sister  for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.
Frankenstein,it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion  but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends  i wish to be allowed to speak  that i may say what i know of her character.
Frankenstein,i am well acquainted with the accused.
Frankenstein,i have lived in the same house with her  at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.
Frankenstein,during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.
Frankenstein,she nursed madame frankenstein  my aunt  in her last illness  with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness  in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her  after which she again lived in my uncle   s house  where she was beloved by all the family.
Frankenstein,she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.
Frankenstein,for my own part  i do not hesitate to say that  notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her  i believe and rely on her perfect innocence.
Frankenstein,she had no temptation for such an action  as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests  if she had earnestly desired it  i should have willingly given it to her  so much do i esteem and value her.
Frankenstein,a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth   s simple and powerful appeal  but it was excited by her generous interference  and not in favour of poor justine  on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence  charging her with the blackest ingratitude.
Frankenstein,she herself wept as elizabeth spoke  but she did not answer.
Frankenstein,my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.
Frankenstein,i believed in her innocence  i knew it.
Frankenstein,could the d  mon who had  i did not for a minute doubt  murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy  i could not sustain the horror of my situation  and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim  i rushed out of the court in agony.
Frankenstein,the tortures of the accused did not equal mine  she was sustained by innocence  but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
Frankenstein,i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.
Frankenstein,in the morning i went to the court  my lips and throat were parched.
Frankenstein,i dared not ask the fatal question  but i was known  and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.
Frankenstein,the ballots had been thrown  they were all black  and justine was condemned.
Frankenstein,i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt.
Frankenstein,i had before experienced sensations of horror  and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions  but words cannot convey an idea of the heart sickening despair that i then endured.
Frankenstein,the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt.
Frankenstein,that evidence    he observed     was hardly required in so glaring a case  but i am glad of it  and  indeed  none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence  be it ever so decisive.
Frankenstein,this was strange and unexpected intelligence  what could it mean  had my eyes deceived me  and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions  i hastened to return home  and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
Frankenstein,my cousin    replied i     it is decided as you may have expected  all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.
Frankenstein,but she has confessed.
Frankenstein,this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth  who had relied with firmness upon justine   s innocence.
Frankenstein,alas    said she.
Frankenstein,how shall i ever again believe in human goodness  justine  whom i loved and esteemed as my sister  how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray  her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile  and yet she has committed a murder.
Frankenstein,soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.
Frankenstein,my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.
Frankenstein,yes    said elizabeth     i will go  although she is guilty  and you  victor  shall accompany me  i cannot go alone.
Frankenstein,the idea of this visit was torture to me  yet i could not refuse.
Frankenstein,we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end  her hands were manacled  and her head rested on her knees.
Frankenstein,she rose on seeing us enter  and when we were left alone with her  she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth  weeping bitterly.
Frankenstein,my cousin wept also.
Frankenstein,oh  justine    said she.
Frankenstein,why did you rob me of my last consolation  i relied on your innocence  and although i was then very wretched  i was not so miserable as i am now.
Frankenstein,and do you also believe that i am so very  very wicked  do you also join with my enemies to crush me  to condemn me as a murderer    her voice was suffocated with sobs.
Frankenstein,rise  my poor girl    said elizabeth     why do you kneel  if you are innocent  i am not one of your enemies  i believed you guiltless  notwithstanding every evidence  until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
Frankenstein,that report  you say  is false  and be assured  dear justine  that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment  but your own confession.
Frankenstein,i did confess  but i confessed a lie.
Frankenstein,i confessed  that i might obtain absolution  but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.
Frankenstein,the god of heaven forgive me  ever since i was condemned  my confessor has besieged me  he threatened and menaced  until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was.
Frankenstein,he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate.
Frankenstein,dear lady  i had none to support me  all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.
Frankenstein,what could i do  in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie  and now only am i truly miserable.
Frankenstein,she paused  weeping  and then continued     i thought with horror  my sweet lady  that you should believe your justine  whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured  and whom you loved  was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
Frankenstein,dear william  dearest blessed child  i soon shall see you again in heaven  where we shall all be happy  and that consoles me  going as i am to suffer ignominy and death.
Frankenstein,oh  justine  forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
Frankenstein,why did you confess  but do not mourn  dear girl.
Frankenstein,do not fear.
Frankenstein,i will proclaim  i will prove your innocence.
Frankenstein,i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.
Frankenstein,you shall not die  you  my playfellow  my companion  my sister  perish on the scaffold  no  no  i never could survive so horrible a misfortune.
Frankenstein,justine shook her head mournfully.
Frankenstein,i do not fear to die    she said     that pang is past.
Frankenstein,god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.
Frankenstein,i leave a sad and bitter world  and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned  i am resigned to the fate awaiting me.
Frankenstein,learn from me  dear lady  to submit in patience to the will of heaven     during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room  where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.
Frankenstein,despair  who dared talk of that  the poor victim  who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death  felt not  as i did  such deep and bitter agony.
Frankenstein,i gnashed my teeth and ground them together  uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.
Frankenstein,justine started.
Frankenstein,when she saw who it was  she approached me and said     dear sir  you are very kind to visit me  you  i hope  do not believe that i am guilty     i could not answer.
Frankenstein,no  justine    said elizabeth     he is more convinced of your innocence than i was  for even when he heard that you had confessed  he did not credit it.
Frankenstein,i truly thank him.
Frankenstein,in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.
Frankenstein,how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am  it removes more than half my misfortune  and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you  dear lady  and your cousin.
Frankenstein,thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.
Frankenstein,she indeed gained the resignation she desired.
Frankenstein,but i  the true murderer  felt the never dying worm alive in my bosom  which allowed of no hope or consolation.
Frankenstein,elizabeth also wept and was unhappy  but hers also was the misery of innocence  which  like a cloud that passes over the fair moon  for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.
Frankenstein,anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart  i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.
Frankenstein,we stayed several hours with justine  and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away.
Frankenstein,i wish    cried she     that i were to die with you  i cannot live in this world of misery.
Frankenstein,justine assumed an air of cheerfulness  while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.
Frankenstein,she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half suppressed emotion     farewell  sweet lady  dearest elizabeth  my beloved and only friend  may heaven  in its bounty  bless and preserve you  may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer  live  and be happy  and make others so.
Frankenstein,and on the morrow justine died.
Frankenstein,elizabeth   s heart rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.
Frankenstein,my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.
Frankenstein,and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh  unfeeling reasoning of these men  my purposed avowal died away on my lips.
Frankenstein,thus i might proclaim myself a madman  but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.
Frankenstein,she perished on the scaffold as a murderess   from the tortures of my own heart  i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth.
Frankenstein,this also was my doing  and my father   s woe  and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice accursed hands  ye weep  unhappy ones  but these are not your last tears  again shall you raise the funeral wail  and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard  frankenstein  your son  your kinsman  your early  much loved friend  he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes  who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances  who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you   he bids you weep  to shed countless tears  happy beyond his hopes  if thus inexorable fate be satisfied  and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments   thus spoke my prophetic soul  as  torn by remorse  horror  and despair  i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine  the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
Frankenstein,nothing is more painful to the human mind than  after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events  the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
Frankenstein,justine died  she rested  and i was alive.
Frankenstein,the blood flowed freely in my veins  but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.
Frankenstein,sleep fled from my eyes  i wandered like an evil spirit  for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible  and more  much more  i persuaded myself  was yet behind.
Frankenstein,yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
Frankenstein,i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.
Frankenstein,now all was blasted  instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self satisfaction  and from thence to gather promise of new hopes  i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt  which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.
Frankenstein,this state of mind preyed upon my health  which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.
Frankenstein,i shunned the face of man  all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me  solitude was my only consolation   deep  dark  deathlike solitude.
Frankenstein,my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
Frankenstein,do you think  victor    said he     that i do not suffer also  no one could love a child more than i loved your brother     tears came into his eyes as he spoke      but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief  it is also a duty owed to yourself  for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment  or even the discharge of daily usefulness  without which no man is fit for society.
Frankenstein,this advice  although good  was totally inapplicable to my case  i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness  and terror its alarm  with my other sensations.
Frankenstein,now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
Frankenstein,about this time we retired to our house at belrive.
Frankenstein,this change was particularly agreeable to me.
Frankenstein,the shutting of the gates regularly at ten o   clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me.
Frankenstein,i was now free.
Frankenstein,often  after the rest of the family had retired for the night  i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.
Frankenstein,sometimes  with my sails set  i was carried by the wind  and sometimes  after rowing into the middle of the lake  i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.
Frankenstein,i was often tempted  when all was at peace around me  and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly   if i except some bat  or the frogs  whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore   often  i say  i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake  that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.
Frankenstein,but i was restrained  when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth  whom i tenderly loved  and whose existence was bound up in mine.
Frankenstein,i thought also of my father and surviving brother  should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them   at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness.
Frankenstein,but that could not be.
Frankenstein,remorse extinguished every hope.
Frankenstein,i had been the author of unalterable evils  and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.
Frankenstein,i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime  which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
Frankenstein,there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind.
Frankenstein,my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.
Frankenstein,when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth  my eyes became inflamed  and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed.
Frankenstein,when i reflected on his crimes and malice  my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.
Frankenstein,i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes  could i  when there  have precipitated him to their base.
Frankenstein,i wished to see him again  that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine.
Frankenstein,our house was the house of mourning.
Frankenstein,my father   s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.
Frankenstein,elizabeth was sad and desponding  she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations  all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead  eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.
Frankenstein,she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.
Frankenstein,the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her  and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.
Frankenstein,when i reflect  my dear cousin    said she     on the miserable death of justine moritz  i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.
Frankenstein,before  i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils  at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination  but now misery has come home  and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other   s blood.
Frankenstein,yet i am certainly unjust.
Frankenstein,everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty  and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered  assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.
Frankenstein,for the sake of a few jewels  to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend  a child whom she had nursed from its birth  and appeared to love as if it had been her own  i could not consent to the death of any human being  but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.
Frankenstein,but she was innocent.
Frankenstein,i know  i feel she was innocent  you are of the same opinion  and that confirms me.
Frankenstein,alas  victor  when falsehood can look so like the truth  who can assure themselves of certain happiness  i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice  towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.
Frankenstein,william and justine were assassinated  and the murderer escapes  he walks about the world free  and perhaps respected.
Frankenstein,but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes  i would not change places with such a wretch.
Frankenstein,i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.
Frankenstein,i  not in deed  but in effect  was the true murderer.
Frankenstein,elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance  and kindly taking my hand  said     my dearest friend  you must calm yourself.
Frankenstein,these events have affected me  god knows how deeply  but i am not so wretched as you are.
Frankenstein,there is an expression of despair  and sometimes of revenge  in your countenance that makes me tremble.
Frankenstein,dear victor  banish these dark passions.
Frankenstein,remember the friends around you  who centre all their hopes in you.
Frankenstein,have we lost the power of rendering you happy  ah  while we love  while we are true to each other  here in this land of peace and beauty  your native country  we may reap every tranquil blessing   what can disturb our peace     and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart  even as she spoke i drew near to her  as if in terror  lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
Frankenstein,thus not the tenderness of friendship  nor the beauty of earth  nor of heaven  could redeem my soul from woe  the very accents of love were ineffectual.
Frankenstein,i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
Frankenstein,the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake  there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it  and to die  was but a type of me.
Frankenstein,sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me  but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek  by bodily exercise and by change of place  some relief from my intolerable sensations.
Frankenstein,it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home  and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys  sought in the magnificence  the eternity of such scenes  to forget myself and my ephemeral  because human  sorrows.
Frankenstein,my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix.
Frankenstein,i had visited it frequently during my boyhood.
Frankenstein,six years had passed since then  i was a wreck  but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
Frankenstein,i performed the first part of my journey on horseback.
Frankenstein,i afterwards hired a mule  as the more sure footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.
Frankenstein,the weather was fine  it was about the middle of the month of august  nearly two months after the death of justine  that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe.
Frankenstein,the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve.
Frankenstein,the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side  the sound of the river raging among the rocks  and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence   and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements  here displayed in their most terrific guise.
Frankenstein,still  as i ascended higher  the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
Frankenstein,ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains  the impetuous arve  and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.
Frankenstein,but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps  whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all  as belonging to another earth  the habitations of another race of beings.
Frankenstein,i passed the bridge of p  lissier  where the ravine  which the river forms  opened before me  and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.
Frankenstein,soon after  i entered the valley of chamounix.
Frankenstein,this valley is more wonderful and sublime  but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox  through which i had just passed.
Frankenstein,the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries  but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.
Frankenstein,immense glaciers approached the road  i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.
Frankenstein,mont blanc  the supreme and magnificent mont blanc  raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles  and its tremendous d  me overlooked the valley.
Frankenstein,a tingling long lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.
Frankenstein,some turn in the road  some new object suddenly perceived and recognised  reminded me of days gone by  and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.
Frankenstein,the very winds whispered in soothing accents  and maternal nature bade me weep no more.
Frankenstein,then again the kindly influence ceased to act   i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.
Frankenstein,then i spurred on my animal  striving so to forget the world  my fears  and more than all  myself   or  in a more desperate fashion  i alighted and threw myself on the grass  weighed down by horror and despair.
Frankenstein,at length i arrived at the village of chamounix.
Frankenstein,exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured.
Frankenstein,for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve  which pursued its noisy way beneath.
Frankenstein,the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations  when i placed my head upon my pillow  sleep crept over me  i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.
Frankenstein,i spent the following day roaming through the valley.
Frankenstein,i stood beside the sources of the arveiron  which take their rise in a glacier  that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.
Frankenstein,the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me  the icy wall of the glacier overhung me  a few shattered pines were scattered around  and the solemn silence of this glorious presence chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment  the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking  reverberated along the mountains  of the accumulated ice  which  through the silent working of immutable laws  was ever and anon rent and torn  as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.
Frankenstein,these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving.
Frankenstein,they elevated me from all littleness of feeling  and although they did not remove my grief  they subdued and tranquillised it.
Frankenstein,in some degree  also  they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.
Frankenstein,i retired to rest at night  my slumbers  as it were  waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day.
Frankenstein,they congregated round me  the unstained snowy mountain top  the glittering pinnacle  the pine woods  and ragged bare ravine  the eagle  soaring amidst the clouds   they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
Frankenstein,where had they fled when the next morning i awoke  all of soul inspiriting fled with sleep  and dark melancholy clouded every thought.
Frankenstein,the rain was pouring in torrents  and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains  so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.
Frankenstein,still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.
Frankenstein,what were rain and storm to me  my mule was brought to the door  and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert.
Frankenstein,i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it.
Frankenstein,it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
Frankenstein,the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.
Frankenstein,i determined to go without a guide  for i was well acquainted with the path  and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
Frankenstein,the ascent is precipitous  but the path is cut into continual and short windings  which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.
Frankenstein,it is a scene terrifically desolate.
Frankenstein,in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived  where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground  some entirely destroyed  others bent  leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.
Frankenstein,the path  as you ascend higher  is intersected by ravines of snow  down which stones continually roll from above  one of them is particularly dangerous  as the slightest sound  such as even speaking in a loud voice  produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.
Frankenstein,the pines are not tall or luxuriant  but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
Frankenstein,i looked on the valley beneath  vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains  whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds  while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me.
Frankenstein,alas  why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute  it only renders them more necessary beings.
Frankenstein,if our impulses were confined to hunger  thirst  and desire  we might be nearly free  but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.
Frankenstein,we rest  a dream has power to poison sleep.
Frankenstein,we rise  one wand   ring thought pollutes the day.
Frankenstein,we feel  conceive  or reason  laugh or weep      embrace fond woe  or cast our cares away  it is the same  for  be it joy or sorrow      the path of its departure still is free.
Frankenstein,man   s yesterday may ne   er be like his morrow      nought may endure but mutability   it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent.
Frankenstein,for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
Frankenstein,a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.
Frankenstein,presently a breeze dissipated the cloud  and i descended upon the glacier.
Frankenstein,the surface is very uneven  rising like the waves of a troubled sea  descending low  and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
Frankenstein,the field of ice is almost a league in width  but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it.
Frankenstein,the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.
Frankenstein,from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite  at the distance of a league  and above it rose mont blanc  in awful majesty.
Frankenstein,i remained in a recess of the rock  gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.
Frankenstein,the sea  or rather the vast river of ice  wound among its dependent mountains  whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.
Frankenstein,their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.
Frankenstein,my heart  which was before sorrowful  now swelled with something like joy  i exclaimed     wandering spirits  if indeed ye wander  and do not rest in your narrow beds  allow me this faint happiness  or take me  as your companion  away from the joys of life.
Frankenstein,as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man  at some distance  advancing towards me with superhuman speed.
Frankenstein,he bounded over the crevices in the ice  among which i had walked with caution  his stature  also  as he approached  seemed to exceed that of man.
Frankenstein,i was troubled  a mist came over my eyes  and i felt a faintness seize me  but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.
Frankenstein,i perceived  as the shape came nearer  sight tremendous and abhorred   that it was the wretch whom i had created.
Frankenstein,i trembled with rage and horror  resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.
Frankenstein,he approached  his countenance bespoke bitter anguish  combined with disdain and malignity  while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.
Frankenstein,but i scarcely observed this  rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance  and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
Frankenstein,devil    i exclaimed     do you dare approach me  and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head  begone  vile insect  or rather  stay  that i may trample you to dust  and  oh  that i could  with the extinction of your miserable existence  restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered        i expected this reception    said the d  mon.
Frankenstein,all men hate the wretched  how  then  must i be hated  who am miserable beyond all living things  yet you  my creator  detest and spurn me  thy creature  to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.
Frankenstein,you purpose to kill me.
Frankenstein,how dare you sport thus with life  do your duty towards me  and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.
Frankenstein,if you will comply with my conditions  i will leave them and you at peace  but if you refuse  i will glut the maw of death  until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.
Frankenstein,abhorred monster  fiend that thou art  the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.
Frankenstein,wretched devil  you reproach me with your creation  come on  then  that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed.
Frankenstein,my rage was without bounds  i sprang on him  impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
Frankenstein,he easily eluded me and said      be calm  i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.
Frankenstein,have i not suffered enough  that you seek to increase my misery  life  although it may only be an accumulation of anguish  is dear to me  and i will defend it.
Frankenstein,remember  thou hast made me more powerful than thyself  my height is superior to thine  my joints more supple.
Frankenstein,but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.
Frankenstein,i am thy creature  and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part  the which thou owest me.
Frankenstein,oh  frankenstein  be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone  to whom thy justice  and even thy clemency and affection  is most due.
Frankenstein,remember that i am thy creature  i ought to be thy adam  but i am rather the fallen angel  whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.
Frankenstein,everywhere i see bliss  from which i alone am irrevocably excluded.
Frankenstein,i was benevolent and good  misery made me a fiend.
Frankenstein,make me happy  and i shall again be virtuous.
Frankenstein,begone  i will not hear you.
Frankenstein,there can be no community between you and me  we are enemies.
Frankenstein,begone  or let us try our strength in a fight  in which one must fall.
Frankenstein,how can i move thee  will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature  who implores thy goodness and compassion  believe me  frankenstein  i was benevolent  my soul glowed with love and humanity  but am i not alone  miserably alone  you  my creator  abhor me  what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures  who owe me nothing  they spurn and hate me.
Frankenstein,the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.
Frankenstein,i have wandered here many days  the caves of ice  which i only do not fear  are a dwelling to me  and the only one which man does not grudge.
Frankenstein,these bleak skies i hail  for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.
Frankenstein,if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence  they would do as you do  and arm themselves for my destruction.
Frankenstein,shall i not then hate them who abhor me  i will keep no terms with my enemies.
Frankenstein,i am miserable  and they shall share my wretchedness.
Frankenstein,yet it is in your power to recompense me  and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great  that not only you and your family  but thousands of others  shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.
Frankenstein,let your compassion be moved  and do not disdain me.
Frankenstein,listen to my tale  when you have heard that  abandon or commiserate me  as you shall judge that i deserve.
Frankenstein,but hear me.
Frankenstein,the guilty are allowed  by human laws  bloody as they are  to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.
Frankenstein,listen to me  frankenstein.
Frankenstein,you accuse me of murder  and yet you would  with a satisfied conscience  destroy your own creature.
Frankenstein,oh  praise the eternal justice of man  yet i ask you not to spare me  listen to me  and then  if you can  and if you will  destroy the work of your hands.
Frankenstein,why do you call to my remembrance    i rejoined     circumstances of which i shudder to reflect  that i have been the miserable origin and author  cursed be the day  abhorred devil  in which you first saw light  cursed  although i curse myself  be the hands that formed you  you have made me wretched beyond expression.
Frankenstein,you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not.
Frankenstein,begone  relieve me from the sight of your detested form.
Frankenstein,thus i relieve thee  my creator    he said  and placed his hated hands before my eyes  which i flung from me with violence     thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor.
Frankenstein,still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.
Frankenstein,by the virtues that i once possessed  i demand this from you.
Frankenstein,hear my tale  it is long and strange  and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations  come to the hut upon the mountain.
Frankenstein,the sun is yet high in the heavens  before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world  you will have heard my story and can decide.
Frankenstein,on you it rests  whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life  or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.
Frankenstein,as he said this he led the way across the ice  i followed.
Frankenstein,my heart was full  and i did not answer him  but as i proceeded  i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.
Frankenstein,i was partly urged by curiosity  and compassion confirmed my resolution.
Frankenstein,i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother  and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
Frankenstein,for the first time  also  i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were  and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness.
Frankenstein,these motives urged me to comply with his demand.
Frankenstein,we crossed the ice  therefore  and ascended the opposite rock.
Frankenstein,the air was cold  and the rain again began to descend  we entered the hut  the fiend with an air of exultation  i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.
Frankenstein,but i consented to listen  and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted  he thus began his tale.
Frankenstein,it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being  all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
Frankenstein,a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me  and i saw  felt  heard  and smelt at the same time  and it was  indeed  a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.
Frankenstein,by degrees  i remember  a stronger light pressed upon my nerves  so that i was obliged to shut my eyes.
Frankenstein,darkness then came over me and troubled me  but hardly had i felt this when  by opening my eyes  as i now suppose  the light poured in upon me again.
Frankenstein,i walked and  i believe  descended  but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Frankenstein,before  dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me  impervious to my touch or sight  but i now found that i could wander on at liberty  with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid.
Frankenstein,the light became more and more oppressive to me  and the heat wearying me as i walked  i sought a place where i could receive shade.
Frankenstein,this was the forest near ingolstadt  and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue  until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst.
Frankenstein,this roused me from my nearly dormant state  and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.
Frankenstein,i slaked my thirst at the brook  and then lying down  was overcome by sleep.
Frankenstein,it was dark when i awoke  i felt cold also  and half frightened  as it were  instinctively  finding myself so desolate.
Frankenstein,before i had quitted your apartment  on a sensation of cold  i had covered myself with some clothes  but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.
Frankenstein,i was a poor  helpless  miserable wretch  i knew  and could distinguish  nothing  but feeling pain invade me on all sides  i sat down and wept.
Frankenstein,soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.
Frankenstein,i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.
Frankenstein,the moon  i gazed with a kind of wonder.
Frankenstein,it moved slowly  but it enlightened my path  and i again went out in search of berries.
Frankenstein,i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak  with which i covered myself  and sat down upon the ground.
Frankenstein,no distinct ideas occupied my mind  all was confused.
Frankenstein,i felt light  and hunger  and thirst  and darkness  innumerable sounds rang in my ears  and on all sides various scents saluted me  the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon  and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.
Frankenstein,several changes of day and night passed  and the orb of night had greatly lessened  when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other.
Frankenstein,i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.
Frankenstein,i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound  which often saluted my ears  proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.
Frankenstein,i began also to observe  with greater accuracy  the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.
Frankenstein,sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
Frankenstein,sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode  but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.
Frankenstein,the moon had disappeared from the night  and again  with a lessened form  showed itself  while i still remained in the forest.
Frankenstein,my sensations had by this time become distinct  and my mind received every day additional ideas.
Frankenstein,my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms  i distinguished the insect from the herb  and by degrees  one herb from another.
Frankenstein,i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes  whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.
Frankenstein,one day  when i was oppressed by cold  i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars  and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it.
Frankenstein,in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers  but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.
Frankenstein,how strange  i thought  that the same cause should produce such opposite effects  i examined the materials of the fire  and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.
Frankenstein,i quickly collected some branches  but they were wet and would not burn.
Frankenstein,i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.
Frankenstein,the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.
Frankenstein,i reflected on this  and by touching the various branches  i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood  that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.
Frankenstein,when night came on and brought sleep with it  i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.
Frankenstein,i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it  and then  spreading my cloak  i lay on the ground and sank into sleep.
Frankenstein,it was morning when i awoke  and my first care was to visit the fire.
Frankenstein,i uncovered it  and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.
Frankenstein,i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches  which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.
Frankenstein,when night came again i found  with pleasure  that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food  for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted  and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees.
Frankenstein,i tried  therefore  to dress my food in the same manner  placing it on the live embers.
Frankenstein,i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation  and the nuts and roots much improved.
Frankenstein,food  however  became scarce  and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.
Frankenstein,when i found this  i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited  to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied.
Frankenstein,in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.
Frankenstein,i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty  but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it  and wrapping myself up in my cloak  i struck across the wood towards the setting sun.
Frankenstein,i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.
Frankenstein,a great fall of snow had taken place the night before  and the fields were of one uniform white  the appearance was disconsolate  and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.
Frankenstein,it was about seven in the morning  and i longed to obtain food and shelter  at length i perceived a small hut  on a rising ground  which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.
Frankenstein,this was a new sight to me  and i examined the structure with great curiosity.
Frankenstein,finding the door open  i entered.
Frankenstein,an old man sat in it  near a fire  over which he was preparing his breakfast.
Frankenstein,he turned on hearing a noise  and perceiving me  shrieked loudly  and quitting the hut  ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.
Frankenstein,his appearance  different from any i had ever before seen  and his flight somewhat surprised me.
Frankenstein,but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut  here the snow and rain could not penetrate  the ground was dry  and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pand  monium appeared to the d  mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.
Frankenstein,i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd   s breakfast  which consisted of bread  cheese  milk  and wine  the latter  however  i did not like.
Frankenstein,then  overcome by fatigue  i lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
Frankenstein,it was noon when i awoke  and allured by the warmth of the sun  which shone brightly on the white ground  i determined to recommence my travels  and  depositing the remains of the peasant   s breakfast in a wallet i found  i proceeded across the fields for several hours  until at sunset i arrived at a village.
Frankenstein,how miraculous did this appear  the huts  the neater cottages  and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.
Frankenstein,the vegetables in the gardens  the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages  allured my appetite.
Frankenstein,one of the best of these i entered  but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked  and one of the women fainted.
Frankenstein,the whole village was roused  some fled  some attacked me  until  grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons  i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel  quite bare  and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village.
Frankenstein,this hovel however  joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance  but after my late dearly bought experience  i dared not enter it.
Frankenstein,my place of refuge was constructed of wood  but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it.
Frankenstein,no wood  however  was placed on the earth  which formed the floor  but it was dry  and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks  i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
Frankenstein,here  then  i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter  however miserable  from the inclemency of the season  and still more from the barbarity of man.
Frankenstein,as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel  that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found.
Frankenstein,it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.
Frankenstein,one part was open  and by that i had crept in  but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood  yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out  all the light i enjoyed came through the sty  and that was sufficient for me.
Frankenstein,having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw  i retired  for i saw the figure of a man at a distance  and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.
Frankenstein,i had first  however  provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread  which i purloined  and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.
Frankenstein,the floor was a little raised  so that it was kept perfectly dry  and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.
Frankenstein,being thus provided  i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.
Frankenstein,it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest  my former residence  the rain dropping branches  and dank earth.
Frankenstein,i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step  and looking through a small chink  i beheld a young creature  with a pail on her head  passing before my hovel.
Frankenstein,the girl was young and of gentle demeanour  unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.
Frankenstein,yet she was meanly dressed  a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb  her fair hair was plaited but not adorned  she looked patient yet sad.
Frankenstein,i lost sight of her  and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail  which was now partly filled with milk.
Frankenstein,as she walked along  seemingly incommoded by the burden  a young man met her  whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.
Frankenstein,uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy  he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.
Frankenstein,she followed  and they disappeared.
Frankenstein,presently i saw the young man again  with some tools in his hand  cross the field behind the cottage  and the girl was also busied  sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.
Frankenstein,on examining my dwelling  i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it  but the panes had been filled up with wood.
Frankenstein,in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
Frankenstein,through this crevice a small room was visible  whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.
Frankenstein,in one corner  near a small fire  sat an old man  leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.
Frankenstein,the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage  but presently she took something out of a drawer  which employed her hands  and she sat down beside the old man  who  taking up an instrument  began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.
Frankenstein,it was a lovely sight  even to me  poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.
Frankenstein,the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence  while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.
Frankenstein,he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion  of which the old man took no notice  until she sobbed audibly  he then pronounced a few sounds  and the fair creature  leaving her work  knelt at his feet.
Frankenstein,he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature  they were a mixture of pain and pleasure  such as i had never before experienced  either from hunger or cold  warmth or food  and i withdrew from the window  unable to bear these emotions.
Frankenstein,soon after this the young man returned  bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.
Frankenstein,the girl met him at the door  helped to relieve him of his burden  and taking some of the fuel into the cottage  placed it on the fire  then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage  and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.
Frankenstein,she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants  which she placed in water  and then upon the fire.
Frankenstein,she afterwards continued her work  whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.
Frankenstein,after he had been employed thus about an hour  the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.
Frankenstein,the old man had  in the meantime  been pensive  but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air  and they sat down to eat.
Frankenstein,the meal was quickly dispatched.
Frankenstein,the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage  the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes  leaning on the arm of the youth.
Frankenstein,nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.
Frankenstein,one was old  with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love  the younger was slight and graceful in his figure  and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry  yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.
Frankenstein,the old man returned to the cottage  and the youth  with tools different from those he had used in the morning  directed his steps across the fields.
Frankenstein,night quickly shut in  but to my extreme wonder  i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers  and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours.
Frankenstein,in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand  and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.
Frankenstein,so soon as he had finished  the youth began  not to play  but to utter sounds that were monotonous  and neither resembling the harmony of the old man   s instrument nor the songs of the birds  i since found that he read aloud  but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters.
Frankenstein,the family  after having been thus occupied for a short time  extinguished their lights and retired  as i conjectured  to rest.
Wuthering Heights,        i have just returned from a visit to my landlord   the solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with.
Wuthering Heights,this is certainly a beautiful country  in all england  i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.
Wuthering Heights,a perfect misanthropist   s heaven   and mr. heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.
Wuthering Heights,a capital fellow  he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows  as i rode up  and when his fingers sheltered themselves  with a jealous resolution  still further in his waistcoat  as i announced my name.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff    i said.
Wuthering Heights,a nod was the answer.
Wuthering Heights,mr. lockwood  your new tenant  sir.
Wuthering Heights,i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival  to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange  i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts          thrushcross grange is my own  sir    he interrupted  wincing.
Wuthering Heights,i should not allow any one to inconvenience me  if i could hinder it   walk in     the    walk in   was uttered with closed teeth  and expressed the sentiment     go to the deuce    even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words  and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation  i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.
Wuthering Heights,when he saw my horse   s breast fairly pushing the barrier  he did put out his hand to unchain it  and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway  calling  as we entered the court       joseph  take mr. lockwood   s horse  and bring up some wine.
Wuthering Heights,here we have the whole establishment of domestics  i suppose    was the reflection suggested by this compound order.
Wuthering Heights,no wonder the grass grows up between the flags  and cattle are the only hedge cutters.
Wuthering Heights,joseph was an elderly  nay  an old man  very old  perhaps  though hale and sinewy.
Wuthering Heights,the lord help us    he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure  while relieving me of my horse  looking  meantime  in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner  and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.
Wuthering Heights,wuthering heights is the name of mr. heathcliff   s dwelling.
Wuthering Heights,wuthering   being a significant provincial adjective  descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.
Wuthering Heights,pure  bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times  indeed  one may guess the power of the north wind  blowing over the edge  by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house  and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way  as if craving alms of the sun.
Wuthering Heights,happily  the architect had foresight to build it strong  the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall  and the corners defended with large jutting stones.
Wuthering Heights,before passing the threshold  i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front  and especially about the principal door  above which  among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys  i detected the date            and the name    hareton earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,i would have made a few comments  and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner  but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance  or complete departure  and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.
Wuthering Heights,one step brought us into the family sitting room  without any introductory lobby or passage  they call it here    the house   pre eminently.
Wuthering Heights,it includes kitchen and parlour  generally  but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter  at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues  and a clatter of culinary utensils  deep within  and i observed no signs of roasting  boiling  or baking  about the huge fireplace  nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.
Wuthering Heights,one end  indeed  reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes  interspersed with silver jugs and tankards  towering row after row  on a vast oak dresser  to the very roof.
Wuthering Heights,the latter had never been under drawn  its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye  except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef  mutton  and ham  concealed it.
Wuthering Heights,above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns  and a couple of horse pistols  and  by way of ornament  three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge.
Wuthering Heights,the floor was of smooth  white stone  the chairs  high backed  primitive structures  painted green  one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.
Wuthering Heights,in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge  liver coloured bitch pointer  surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies  and other dogs haunted other recesses.
Wuthering Heights,the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely  northern farmer  with a stubborn countenance  and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters.
Wuthering Heights,such an individual seated in his arm chair  his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him  is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills  if you go at the right time after dinner.
Wuthering Heights,but mr. heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.
Wuthering Heights,he is a dark skinned gipsy in aspect  in dress and manners a gentleman  that is  as much a gentleman as many a country squire  rather slovenly  perhaps  yet not looking amiss with his negligence  because he has an erect and handsome figure  and rather morose.
Wuthering Heights,possibly  some people might suspect him of a degree of under bred pride  i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort  i know  by instinct  his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling   to manifestations of mutual kindliness.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll love and hate equally under cover  and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.
Wuthering Heights,no  i   m running on too fast  i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would be acquaintance  to those which actuate me.
Wuthering Heights,let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar  my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home  and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.
Wuthering Heights,while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast  i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature  a real goddess in my eyes  as long as she took no notice of me.
Wuthering Heights,i    never told my love   vocally  still  if looks have language  the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears  she understood me at last  and looked a return   the sweetest of all imaginable looks.
Wuthering Heights,and what did i do  i confess it with shame   shrunk icily into myself  like a snail  at every glance retired colder and farther  till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses  and  overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake  persuaded her mamma to decamp.
Wuthering Heights,by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness  how undeserved  i alone can appreciate.
Wuthering Heights,i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced  and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother  who had left her nursery  and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs  her lip curled up  and her white teeth watering for a snatch.
Wuthering Heights,my caress provoked a long  guttural gnarl.
Wuthering Heights,you   d better let the dog alone    growled mr. heathcliff in unison  checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.
Wuthering Heights,she   s not accustomed to be spoiled   not kept for a pet.
Wuthering Heights,then  striding to a side door  he shouted again     joseph     joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar  but gave no intimation of ascending  so his master dived down to him  leaving me vis    vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep dogs  who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.
Wuthering Heights,not anxious to come in contact with their fangs  i sat still  but  imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults  i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio  and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam  that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees.
Wuthering Heights,i flung her back  and hastened to interpose the table between us.
Wuthering Heights,this proceeding aroused the whole hive  half a dozen four footed fiends  of various sizes and ages  issued from hidden dens to the common centre.
Wuthering Heights,i felt my heels and coat laps peculiar subjects of assault  and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker  i was constrained to demand  aloud  assistance from some of the household in re establishing peace.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm  i don   t think they moved one second faster than usual  though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.
Wuthering Heights,happily  an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch  a lusty dame  with tucked up gown  bare arms  and fire flushed cheeks  rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying pan  and used that weapon  and her tongue  to such purpose  that the storm subsided magically  and she only remained  heaving like a sea after a high wind  when her master entered on the scene.
Wuthering Heights,what the devil is the matter    he asked  eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.
Wuthering Heights,what the devil  indeed    i muttered.
Wuthering Heights,the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours  sir.
Wuthering Heights,you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers        they won   t meddle with persons who touch nothing    he remarked  putting the bottle before me  and restoring the displaced table.
Wuthering Heights,the dogs do right to be vigilant.
Wuthering Heights,take a glass of wine        no  thank you.
Wuthering Heights,not bitten  are you        if i had been  i would have set my signet on the biter.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff   s countenance relaxed into a grin.
Wuthering Heights,come  come    he said     you are flurried  mr. lockwood.
Wuthering Heights,here  take a little wine.
Wuthering Heights,guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs  i am willing to own  hardly know how to receive them.
Wuthering Heights,your health  sir     i bowed and returned the pledge  beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs  besides  i felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense  since his humour took that turn.
Wuthering Heights,he   probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant   relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs  and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me    a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.
Wuthering Heights,i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched  and before i went home  i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.
Wuthering Heights,i shall go  notwithstanding.
Wuthering Heights,it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him.
Wuthering Heights,yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.
Wuthering Heights,i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire  instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights.
Wuthering Heights,on coming up from dinner  however   n.b.
Wuthering Heights,i dine between twelve and one o   clock  the housekeeper  a matronly lady  taken as a fixture along with the house  could not  or would not  comprehend my request that i might be served at five    on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention  and stepping into the room  i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal scuttles  and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.
Wuthering Heights,this spectacle drove me back immediately  i took my hat  and  after a four miles    walk  arrived at heathcliff   s garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.
Wuthering Heights,on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost  and the air made me shiver through every limb.
Wuthering Heights,being unable to remove the chain  i jumped over  and  running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes  knocked vainly for admittance  till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.
Wuthering Heights,wretched inmates    i ejaculated  mentally     you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality.
Wuthering Heights,at least  i would not keep my doors barred in the day time.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t care   i will get in    so resolved  i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.
Wuthering Heights,vinegar faced joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.
Wuthering Heights,what are ye for    he shouted.
Wuthering Heights,t    maister   s down i    t    fowld.
Wuthering Heights,go round by th    end o    t    laith  if ye went to spake to him.
Wuthering Heights,is there nobody inside to open the door    i hallooed  responsively.
Wuthering Heights,there   s nobbut t    missis  and shoo   ll not oppen    t an ye mak    yer flaysome dins till neeght.
Wuthering Heights,why  cannot you tell her whom i am  eh  joseph        nor ne me  i   ll hae no hend wi   t    muttered the head  vanishing.
Wuthering Heights,the snow began to drive thickly.
Wuthering Heights,i seized the handle to essay another trial  when a young man without coat  and shouldering a pitchfork  appeared in the yard behind.
Wuthering Heights,he hailed me to follow him  and  after marching through a wash house  and a paved area containing a coal shed  pump  and pigeon cot  we at length arrived in the huge  warm  cheerful apartment where i was formerly received.
Wuthering Heights,it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire  compounded of coal  peat  and wood  and near the table  laid for a plentiful evening meal  i was pleased to observe the    missis    an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected.
Wuthering Heights,i bowed and waited  thinking she would bid me take a seat.
Wuthering Heights,she looked at me  leaning back in her chair  and remained motionless and mute.
Wuthering Heights,rough weather    i remarked.
Wuthering Heights,i   m afraid  mrs. heathcliff  the door must bear the consequence of your servants    leisure attendance  i had hard work to make them hear me.
Wuthering Heights,she never opened her mouth.
Wuthering Heights,i stared   she stared also  at any rate  she kept her eyes on me in a cool  regardless manner  exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.
Wuthering Heights,sit down    said the young man  gruffly.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll be in soon.
Wuthering Heights,i obeyed  and hemmed  and called the villain juno  who deigned  at this second interview  to move the extreme tip of her tail  in token of owning my acquaintance.
Wuthering Heights,a beautiful animal    i commenced again.
Wuthering Heights,do you intend parting with the little ones  madam        they are not mine    said the amiable hostess  more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied.
Wuthering Heights,ah  your favourites are among these    i continued  turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.
Wuthering Heights,a strange choice of favourites    she observed scornfully.
Wuthering Heights,unluckily  it was a heap of dead rabbits.
Wuthering Heights,i hemmed once more  and drew closer to the hearth  repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.
Wuthering Heights,you should not have come out    she said  rising and reaching from the chimney piece two of the painted canisters.
Wuthering Heights,her position before was sheltered from the light  now  i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance.
Wuthering Heights,she was slender  and apparently scarcely past girlhood  an admirable form  and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding  small features  very fair  flaxen ringlets  or rather golden  hanging loose on her delicate neck  and eyes  had they been agreeable in expression  that would have been irresistible  fortunately for my susceptible heart  the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation  singularly unnatural to be detected there.
Wuthering Heights,the canisters were almost out of her reach  i made a motion to aid her  she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t want your help    she snapped     i can get them for myself.
Wuthering Heights,i beg your pardon    i hastened to reply.
Wuthering Heights,were you asked to tea    she demanded  tying an apron over her neat black frock  and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be glad to have a cup    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,were you asked    she repeated.
Wuthering Heights,no    i said  half smiling.
Wuthering Heights,you are the proper person to ask me.
Wuthering Heights,she flung the tea back  spoon and all  and resumed her chair in a pet  her forehead corrugated  and her red under lip pushed out  like a child   s ready to cry.
Wuthering Heights,meanwhile  the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment  and  erecting himself before the blaze  looked down on me from the corner of his eyes  for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us.
Wuthering Heights,i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not  his dress and speech were both rude  entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr. and mrs. heathcliff  his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated  his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks  and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer  still his bearing was free  almost haughty  and he showed none of a domestic   s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.
Wuthering Heights,in the absence of clear proofs of his condition  i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct  and  five minutes afterwards  the entrance of heathcliff relieved me  in some measure  from my uncomfortable state.
Wuthering Heights,you see  sir  i am come  according to promise    i exclaimed  assuming the cheerful     and i fear i shall be weather bound for half an hour  if you can afford me shelter during that space.
Wuthering Heights,half an hour    he said  shaking the white flakes from his clothes     i wonder you should select the thick of a snow storm to ramble about in.
Wuthering Heights,do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes  people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings  and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.
Wuthering Heights,perhaps i can get a guide among your lads  and he might stay at the grange till morning   could you spare me one        no  i could not.
Wuthering Heights,oh  indeed  well  then  i must trust to my own sagacity.
Wuthering Heights,umph        are you going to mak    the tea    demanded he of the shabby coat  shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.
Wuthering Heights,is he to have any    she asked  appealing to heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,get it ready  will you    was the answer  uttered so savagely that i started.
Wuthering Heights,the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature.
Wuthering Heights,i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow.
Wuthering Heights,when the preparations were finished  he invited me with      now  sir  bring forward your chair.
Wuthering Heights,and we all  including the rustic youth  drew round the table  an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.
Wuthering Heights,i thought  if i had caused the cloud  it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it.
Wuthering Heights,they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn  and it was impossible  however ill tempered they might be  that the universal scowl they wore was their every day countenance.
Wuthering Heights,it is strange    i began  in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another      it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas  many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend  mr. heathcliff  yet  i   ll venture to say  that  surrounded by your family  and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart          my amiable lady    he interrupted  with an almost diabolical sneer on his face.
Wuthering Heights,where is she   my amiable lady        mrs. heathcliff  your wife  i mean.
Wuthering Heights,well  yes   oh  you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel  and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights  even when her body is gone.
Wuthering Heights,is that it     perceiving myself in a blunder  i attempted to correct it.
Wuthering Heights,i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife.
Wuthering Heights,one was about forty  a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls  that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years.
Wuthering Heights,the other did not look seventeen.
Wuthering Heights,then it flashed upon me      the clown at my elbow  who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands  may be her husband  heathcliff junior  of course.
Wuthering Heights,here is the consequence of being buried alive  she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed  a sad pity   i must beware how i cause her to regret her choice.
Wuthering Heights,the last reflection may seem conceited  it was not.
Wuthering Heights,my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive  i knew  through experience  that i was tolerably attractive.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff is my daughter in law    said heathcliff  corroborating my surmise.
Wuthering Heights,he turned  as he spoke  a peculiar look in her direction  a look of hatred  unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not  like those of other people  interpret the language of his soul.
Wuthering Heights,ah  certainly   i see now  you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy    i remarked  turning to my neighbour.
Wuthering Heights,this was worse than before  the youth grew crimson  and clenched his fist  with every appearance of a meditated assault.
Wuthering Heights,but he seemed to recollect himself presently  and smothered the storm in a brutal curse  muttered on my behalf  which  however  i took care not to notice.
Wuthering Heights,unhappy in your conjectures  sir    observed my host     we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy  her mate is dead.
Wuthering Heights,i said she was my daughter in law  therefore  she must have married my son.
Wuthering Heights,and this young man is          not my son  assuredly.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff smiled again  as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.
Wuthering Heights,my name is hareton earnshaw    growled the other     and i   d counsel you to respect it        i   ve shown no disrespect    was my reply  laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself.
Wuthering Heights,he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare  for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.
Wuthering Heights,i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.
Wuthering Heights,the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame  and more than neutralised  the glowing physical comforts round me  and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time.
Wuthering Heights,the business of eating being concluded  and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation  i approached a window to examine the weather.
Wuthering Heights,a sorrowful sight i saw  dark night coming down prematurely  and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide    i could not help exclaiming.
Wuthering Heights,the roads will be buried already  and  if they were bare  i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.
Wuthering Heights,they   ll be covered if left in the fold all night  and put a plank before them    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,how must i do    i continued  with rising irritation.
Wuthering Heights,there was no reply to my question  and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs  and mrs. heathcliff leaning over the fire  diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney piece as she restored the tea canister to its place.
Wuthering Heights,the former  when he had deposited his burden  took a critical survey of the room  and in cracked tones grated out      aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i    idleness un war  when all on    ems goan out  bud yah   re a nowt  and it   s no use talking   yah   ll niver mend o   yer ill ways  but goa raight to t    divil  like yer mother afore ye     i imagined  for a moment  that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me  and  sufficiently enraged  stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff  however  checked me by her answer.
Wuthering Heights,you scandalous old hypocrite    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,are you not afraid of being carried away bodily  whenever you mention the devil   s name  i warn you to refrain from provoking me  or i   ll ask your abduction as a special favour  stop  look here  joseph    she continued  taking a long  dark book from a shelf     i   ll show you how far i   ve progressed in the black art  i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it.
Wuthering Heights,the red cow didn   t die by chance  and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations        oh  wicked  wicked    gasped the elder     may the lord deliver us from evil        no  reprobate  you are a castaway   be off  or i   ll hurt you seriously  i   ll have you all modelled in wax and clay  and the first who passes the limits i fix shall   i   ll not say what he shall be done to   but  you   ll see  go  i   m looking at you     the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes  and joseph  trembling with sincere horror  hurried out  praying  and ejaculating    wicked   as he went.
Wuthering Heights,i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun  and  now that we were alone  i endeavoured to interest her in my distress.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff    i said earnestly     you must excuse me for troubling you.
Wuthering Heights,i presume  because  with that face  i   m sure you cannot help being good hearted.
Wuthering Heights,do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home  i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london        take the road you came    she answered  ensconcing herself in a chair  with a candle  and the long book open before her.
Wuthering Heights,it is brief advice  but as sound as i can give.
Wuthering Heights,then  if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow  your conscience won   t whisper that it is partly your fault        how so  i cannot escort you.
Wuthering Heights,they wouldn   t let me go to the end of the garden wall.
Wuthering Heights,you  i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold  for my convenience  on such a night    i cried.
Wuthering Heights,i want you to tell me my way  not to show it  or else to persuade mr. heathcliff to give me a guide.
Wuthering Heights,who  there is himself  earnshaw  zillah  joseph and i.
Wuthering Heights,which would you have        are there no boys at the farm        no  those are all.
Wuthering Heights,then  it follows that i am compelled to stay.
Wuthering Heights,that you may settle with your host.
Wuthering Heights,i have nothing to do with it.
Wuthering Heights,i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills    cried heathcliff   s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.
Wuthering Heights,as to staying here  i don   t keep accommodations for visitors  you must share a bed with hareton or joseph  if you do.
Wuthering Heights,i can sleep on a chair in this room    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,no  no  a stranger is a stranger  be he rich or poor  it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while i am off guard    said the unmannerly wretch.
Wuthering Heights,with this insult my patience was at an end.
Wuthering Heights,i uttered an expression of disgust  and pushed past him into the yard  running against earnshaw in my haste.
Wuthering Heights,it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit  and  as i wandered round  i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other.
Wuthering Heights,at first the young man appeared about to befriend me.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll go with him as far as the park    he said.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll go with him to hell    exclaimed his master  or whatever relation he bore.
Wuthering Heights,and who is to look after the horses  eh        a man   s life is of more consequence than one evening   s neglect of the horses  somebody must go    murmured mrs. heathcliff  more kindly than i expected.
Wuthering Heights,not at your command    retorted hareton.
Wuthering Heights,if you set store on him  you   d better be quiet.
Wuthering Heights,then i hope his ghost will haunt you  and i hope mr. heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin    she answered  sharply.
Wuthering Heights,hearken  hearken  shoo   s cursing on    em    muttered joseph  towards whom i had been steering.
Wuthering Heights,he sat within earshot  milking the cows by the light of a lantern  which i seized unceremoniously  and  calling out that i would send it back on the morrow  rushed to the nearest postern.
Wuthering Heights,maister  maister  he   s staling t    lanthern    shouted the ancient  pursuing my retreat.
Wuthering Heights,hey  gnasher  hey  dog  hey wolf  holld him  holld him     on opening the little door  two hairy monsters flew at my throat  bearing me down  and extinguishing the light  while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.
Wuthering Heights,fortunately  the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws  and yawning  and flourishing their tails  than devouring me alive  but they would suffer no resurrection  and i was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me  then  hatless and trembling with wrath  i ordered the miscreants to let me out   on their peril to keep me one minute longer   with several incoherent threats of retaliation that  in their indefinite depth of virulency  smacked of king lear.
Wuthering Heights,the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose  and still heathcliff laughed  and still i scolded.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t know what would have concluded the scene  had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself  and more benevolent than my entertainer.
Wuthering Heights,this was zillah  the stout housewife  who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.
Wuthering Heights,she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me  and  not daring to attack her master  she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.
Wuthering Heights,well  mr. earnshaw    she cried     i wonder what you   ll have agait next  are we going to murder folk on our very door stones  i see this house will never do for me   look at t    poor lad  he   s fair choking  wisht  wisht  you mun   n   t go on so.
Wuthering Heights,come in  and i   ll cure that  there now  hold ye still.
Wuthering Heights,with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck  and pulled me into the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff followed  his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.
Wuthering Heights,i was sick exceedingly  and dizzy  and faint  and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof.
Wuthering Heights,he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy  and then passed on to the inner room  while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament  and having obeyed his orders  whereby i was somewhat revived  ushered me to bed.
Wuthering Heights,while leading the way upstairs  she recommended that i should hide the candle  and not make a noise  for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in  and never let anybody lodge there willingly.
Wuthering Heights,i asked the reason.
Wuthering Heights,she did not know  she answered  she had only lived there a year or two  and they had so many queer goings on  she could not begin to be curious.
Wuthering Heights,too stupefied to be curious myself  i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed.
Wuthering Heights,the whole furniture consisted of a chair  a clothes press  and a large oak case  with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows.
Wuthering Heights,having approached this structure  i looked inside  and perceived it to be a singular sort of old fashioned couch  very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself.
Wuthering Heights,in fact  it formed a little closet  and the ledge of a window  which it enclosed  served as a table.
Wuthering Heights,i slid back the panelled sides  got in with my light  pulled them together again  and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff  and every one else.
Wuthering Heights,the ledge  where i placed my candle  had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner  and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.
Wuthering Heights,this writing  however  was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters  large and small   catherine earnshaw  here and there varied to catherine heathcliff  and then again to catherine linton.
Wuthering Heights,in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window  and continued spelling over catherine earnshaw   heathcliff   linton  till my eyes closed  but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark  as vivid as spectres   the air swarmed with catherines  and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name  i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes  and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf skin.
Wuthering Heights,i snuffed it off  and  very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea  sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.
Wuthering Heights,it was a testament  in lean type  and smelling dreadfully musty  a fly leaf bore the inscription      catherine earnshaw  her book    and a date some quarter of a century back.
Wuthering Heights,i shut it  and took up another and another  till i had examined all.
Wuthering Heights,catherine   s library was select  and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used  though not altogether for a legitimate purpose  scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen and ink commentary   at least the appearance of one   covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left.
Wuthering Heights,some were detached sentences  other parts took the form of a regular diary  scrawled in an unformed  childish hand.
Wuthering Heights,at the top of an extra page  quite a treasure  probably  when first lighted on  i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend joseph    rudely  yet powerfully sketched.
Wuthering Heights,an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine  and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.
Wuthering Heights,an awful sunday    commenced the paragraph beneath.
Wuthering Heights,i wish my father were back again.
Wuthering Heights,hindley is a detestable substitute   his conduct to heathcliff is atrocious   h. and i are going to rebel   we took our initiatory step this evening.
Wuthering Heights,all day had been flooding with rain  we could not go to church  so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret  and  while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire   doing anything but reading their bibles  i   ll answer for it   heathcliff  myself  and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books  and mount  we were ranged in a row  on a sack of corn  groaning and shivering  and hoping that joseph would shiver too  so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake.
Wuthering Heights,a vain idea  the service lasted precisely three hours  and yet my brother had the face to exclaim  when he saw us descending     what  done already     on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play  if we did not make much noise  now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.
Wuthering Heights,you forget you have a master here     says the tyrant.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll demolish the first who puts me out of temper  i insist on perfect sobriety and silence.
Wuthering Heights,oh  boy  was that you  frances darling  pull his hair as you go by  i heard him snap his fingers.
Wuthering Heights,frances pulled his hair heartily  and then went and seated herself on her husband   s knee  and there they were  like two babies  kissing and talking nonsense by the hour   foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.
Wuthering Heights,we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser.
Wuthering Heights,i had just fastened our pinafores together  and hung them up for a curtain  when in comes joseph  on an errand from the stables.
Wuthering Heights,he tears down my handiwork  boxes my ears  and croaks         t    maister nobbut just buried  and sabbath not o   ered  und t    sound o    t    gospel still i    yer lugs  and ye darr be laiking  shame on ye  sit ye down  ill childer  there   s good books eneugh if ye   ll read    em  sit ye down  and think o    yer sowls         saying this  he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us.
Wuthering Heights,i could not bear the employment.
Wuthering Heights,i took my dingy volume by the scroop  and hurled it into the dog kennel  vowing i hated a good book.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff kicked his to the same place.
Wuthering Heights,then there was a hubbub         maister hindley     shouted our chaplain.
Wuthering Heights,maister  coom hither  miss cathy   s riven th    back off    th    helmet o    salvation    un    heathcliff   s pawsed his fit into t    first part o       t    brooad way to destruction    it   s fair flaysome that ye let    em go on this gait.
Wuthering Heights,ech  th    owd man wad ha    laced    em properly   but he   s goan         hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth  and seizing one of us by the collar  and the other by the arm  hurled both into the back kitchen  where  joseph asseverated     owd nick    would fetch us as sure as we were living  and  so comforted  we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.
Wuthering Heights,i reached this book  and a pot of ink from a shelf  and pushed the house door ajar to give me light  and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes  but my companion is impatient  and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman   s cloak  and have a scamper on the moors  under its shelter.
Wuthering Heights,a pleasant suggestion   and then  if the surly old man come in  he may believe his prophecy verified   we cannot be damper  or colder  in the rain than we are here.
Wuthering Heights,i suppose catherine fulfilled her project  for the next sentence took up another subject  she waxed lachrymose.
Wuthering Heights,how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so    she wrote.
Wuthering Heights,my head aches  till i cannot keep it on the pillow  and still i can   t give over.
Wuthering Heights,poor heathcliff  hindley calls him a vagabond  and won   t let him sit with us  nor eat with us any more  and  he says  he and i must not play together  and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders.
Wuthering Heights,he has been blaming our father  how dared he   for treating h. too liberally  and swears he will reduce him to his right place                    i began to nod drowsily over the dim page  my eye wandered from manuscript to print.
Wuthering Heights,i saw a red ornamented title      seventy times seven  and the first of the seventy first.
Wuthering Heights,a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabez branderham  in the chapel of gimmerden sough.
Wuthering Heights,and while i was  half consciously  worrying my brain to guess what jabez branderham would make of his subject  i sank back in bed  and fell asleep.
Wuthering Heights,alas  for the effects of bad tea and bad temper  what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night  i don   t remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering.
Wuthering Heights,i began to dream  almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality.
Wuthering Heights,i thought it was morning  and i had set out on my way home  with joseph for a guide.
Wuthering Heights,the snow lay yards deep in our road  and  as we floundered on  my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a pilgrim   s staff  telling me that i could never get into the house without one  and boastfully flourishing a heavy headed cudgel  which i understood to be so denominated.
Wuthering Heights,for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.
Wuthering Heights,then a new idea flashed across me.
Wuthering Heights,i was not going there  we were journeying to hear the famous jabez branderham preach  from the text      seventy times seven    and either joseph  the preacher  or i had committed the    first of the seventy first    and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
Wuthering Heights,we came to the chapel.
Wuthering Heights,i have passed it really in my walks  twice or thrice  it lies in a hollow  between two hills  an elevated hollow  near a swamp  whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there.
Wuthering Heights,the roof has been kept whole hitherto  but as the clergyman   s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum  and a house with two rooms  threatening speedily to determine into one  no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor  especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.
Wuthering Heights,however  in my dream  jabez had a full and attentive congregation  and he preached   good god  what a sermon  divided into four hundred and ninety parts  each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit  and each discussing a separate sin  where he searched for them  i cannot tell.
Wuthering Heights,he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase  and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion.
Wuthering Heights,they were of the most curious character  odd transgressions that i never imagined previously.
Wuthering Heights,oh  how weary i grew.
Wuthering Heights,how i writhed  and yawned  and nodded  and revived  how i pinched and pricked myself  and rubbed my eyes  and stood up  and sat down again  and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done.
Wuthering Heights,i was condemned to hear all out  finally  he reached the    first of the seventy first.
Wuthering Heights,at that crisis  a sudden inspiration descended on me  i was moved to rise and denounce jabez branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon.
Wuthering Heights,sir    i exclaimed     sitting here within these four walls  at one stretch  i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse.
Wuthering Heights,seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to depart   seventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat.
Wuthering Heights,the four hundred and ninety first is too much.
Wuthering Heights,fellow martyrs  have at him  drag him down  and crush him to atoms  that the place which knows him may know him no more        thou art the man    cried jabez  after a solemn pause  leaning over his cushion.
Wuthering Heights,seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage   seventy times seven did i take counsel with my soul   lo  this is human weakness  this also may be absolved  the first of the seventy first is come.
Wuthering Heights,brethren  execute upon him the judgment written.
Wuthering Heights,such honour have all his saints     with that concluding word  the whole assembly  exalting their pilgrim   s staves  rushed round me in a body  and i  having no weapon to raise in self defence  commenced grappling with joseph  my nearest and most ferocious assailant  for his.
Wuthering Heights,in the confluence of the multitude  several clubs crossed  blows  aimed at me  fell on other sconces.
Wuthering Heights,presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings  every man   s hand was against his neighbour  and branderham  unwilling to remain idle  poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit  which responded so smartly that  at last  to my unspeakable relief  they woke me.
Wuthering Heights,and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult  what had played jabez   s part in the row  merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by  and rattled its dry cones against the panes  i listened doubtingly an instant  detected the disturber  then turned and dozed  and dreamt again  if possible  still more disagreeably than before.
Wuthering Heights,this time  i remembered i was lying in the oak closet  and i heard distinctly the gusty wind  and the driving of the snow  i heard  also  the fir bough repeat its teasing sound  and ascribed it to the right cause  but it annoyed me so much  that i resolved to silence it  if possible  and  i thought  i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.
Wuthering Heights,the hook was soldered into the staple  a circumstance observed by me when awake  but forgotten.
Wuthering Heights,i must stop it  nevertheless    i muttered  knocking my knuckles through the glass  and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch  instead of which  my fingers closed on the fingers of a little  ice cold hand   the intense horror of nightmare came over me  i tried to draw back my arm  but the hand clung to it  and a most melancholy voice sobbed      let me in   let me in        who are you    i asked  struggling  meanwhile  to disengage myself.
Wuthering Heights,catherine linton    it replied  shiveringly  why did i think of linton  i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton       i   m come home  i   d lost my way on the moor     as it spoke  i discerned  obscurely  a child   s face looking through the window.
Wuthering Heights,terror made me cruel  and  finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off  i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane  and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes  still it wailed     let me in    and maintained its tenacious gripe  almost maddening me with fear.
Wuthering Heights,how can i    i said at length.
Wuthering Heights,let me go  if you want me to let you in     the fingers relaxed  i snatched mine through the hole  hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it  and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.
Wuthering Heights,i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour  yet  the instant i listened again  there was the doleful cry moaning on      begone    i shouted.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll never let you in  not if you beg for twenty years.
Wuthering Heights,it is twenty years    mourned the voice     twenty years.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve been a waif for twenty years     thereat began a feeble scratching outside  and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.
Wuthering Heights,i tried to jump up  but could not stir a limb  and so yelled aloud  in a frenzy of fright.
Wuthering Heights,to my confusion  i discovered the yell was not ideal  hasty footsteps approached my chamber door  somebody pushed it open  with a vigorous hand  and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.
Wuthering Heights,i sat shuddering  yet  and wiping the perspiration from my forehead  the intruder appeared to hesitate  and muttered to himself.
Wuthering Heights,at last  he said  in a half whisper  plainly not expecting an answer      is any one here     i considered it best to confess my presence  for i knew heathcliff   s accents  and feared he might search further  if i kept quiet.
Wuthering Heights,with this intention  i turned and opened the panels.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff stood near the entrance  in his shirt and trousers  with a candle dripping over his fingers  and his face as white as the wall behind him.
Wuthering Heights,the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock  the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet  and his agitation was so extreme  that he could hardly pick it up.
Wuthering Heights,it is only your guest  sir    i called out  desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further.
Wuthering Heights,i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep  owing to a frightful nightmare.
Wuthering Heights,i   m sorry i disturbed you.
Wuthering Heights,oh  god confound you  mr. lockwood  i wish you were at the      commenced my host  setting the candle on a chair  because he found it impossible to hold it steady.
Wuthering Heights,and who showed you up into this room    he continued  crushing his nails into his palms  and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions.
Wuthering Heights,who was it  i   ve a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment        it was your servant zillah    i replied  flinging myself on to the floor  and rapidly resuming my garments.
Wuthering Heights,i should not care if you did  mr. heathcliff  she richly deserves it.
Wuthering Heights,i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted  at my expense.
Wuthering Heights,well  it is   swarming with ghosts and goblins  you have reason in shutting it up  i assure you.
Wuthering Heights,no one will thank you for a doze in such a den        what do you mean    asked heathcliff     and what are you doing  lie down and finish out the night  since you are here  but  for heaven   s sake  don   t repeat that horrid noise  nothing could excuse it  unless you were having your throat cut        if the little fiend had got in at the window  she probably would have strangled me    i returned.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again.
Wuthering Heights,was not the reverend jabez branderham akin to you on the mother   s side  and that minx  catherine linton  or earnshaw  or however she was called   she must have been a changeling   wicked little soul  she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years  a just punishment for her mortal transgressions  i   ve no doubt     scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of heathcliff   s with catherine   s name in the book  which had completely slipped from my memory  till thus awakened.
Wuthering Heights,i blushed at my inconsideration  but  without showing further consciousness of the offence  i hastened to add      the truth is  sir  i passed the first part of the night in      here i stopped afresh   i was about to say    perusing those old volumes    then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written  as well as their printed  contents  so  correcting myself  i went on      in spelling over the name scratched on that window ledge.
Wuthering Heights,a monotonous occupation  calculated to set me asleep  like counting  or          what can you mean by talking in this way to me    thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence.
Wuthering Heights,how   how dare you  under my roof    god  he   s mad to speak so    and he struck his forehead with rage.
Wuthering Heights,i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation  but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams  affirming i had never heard the appellation of    catherine linton   before  but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed  as i spoke  finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.
Wuthering Heights,i guessed  however  by his irregular and intercepted breathing  that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.
Wuthering Heights,not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict  i continued my toilette rather noisily  looked at my watch  and soliloquised on the length of the night     not three o   clock yet  i could have taken oath it had been six.
Wuthering Heights,time stagnates here  we must surely have retired to rest at eight        always at nine in winter  and rise at four    said my host  suppressing a groan  and  as i fancied  by the motion of his arm   s shadow  dashing a tear from his eyes.
Wuthering Heights,mr. lockwood    he added     you may go into my room  you   ll only be in the way  coming downstairs so early  and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.
Wuthering Heights,and for me  too    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll walk in the yard till daylight  and then i   ll be off  and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.
Wuthering Heights,i   m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society  be it country or town.
Wuthering Heights,a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.
Wuthering Heights,delightful company    muttered heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,take the candle  and go where you please.
Wuthering Heights,i shall join you directly.
Wuthering Heights,keep out of the yard  though  the dogs are unchained  and the house   juno mounts sentinel there  and   nay  you can only ramble about the steps and passages.
Wuthering Heights,but  away with you  i   ll come in two minutes     i obeyed  so far as to quit the chamber  when  ignorant where the narrow lobbies led  i stood still  and was witness  involuntarily  to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied  oddly  his apparent sense.
Wuthering Heights,he got on to the bed  and wrenched open the lattice  bursting  as he pulled at it  into an uncontrollable passion of tears.
Wuthering Heights,come in  come in    he sobbed.
Wuthering Heights,cathy  do come.
Wuthering Heights,oh  do   once more  oh  my heart   s darling  hear me this time  catherine  at last    the spectre showed a spectre   s ordinary caprice  it gave no sign of being  but the snow and wind whirled wildly through  even reaching my station  and blowing out the light.
Wuthering Heights,there was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving  that my compassion made me overlook its folly  and i drew off  half angry to have listened at all  and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare  since it produced that agony  though why was beyond my comprehension.
Wuthering Heights,i descended cautiously to the lower regions  and landed in the back kitchen  where a gleam of fire  raked compactly together  enabled me to rekindle my candle.
Wuthering Heights,nothing was stirring except a brindled  grey cat  which crept from the ashes  and saluted me with a querulous mew.
Wuthering Heights,two benches  shaped in sections of a circle  nearly enclosed the hearth  on one of these i stretched myself  and grimalkin mounted the other.
Wuthering Heights,we were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat  and then it was joseph  shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof  through a trap  the ascent to his garret  i suppose.
Wuthering Heights,he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs  swept the cat from its elevation  and bestowing himself in the vacancy  commenced the operation of stuffing a three inch pipe with tobacco.
Wuthering Heights,my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark  he silently applied the tube to his lips  folded his arms  and puffed away.
Wuthering Heights,i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed  and after sucking out his last wreath  and heaving a profound sigh  he got up  and departed as solemnly as he came.
Wuthering Heights,a more elastic footstep entered next  and now i opened my mouth for a    good morning    but closed it again  the salutation unachieved  for hareton earnshaw was performing his orison sotto voce  in a series of curses directed against every object he touched  while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.
Wuthering Heights,he glanced over the back of the bench  dilating his nostrils  and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.
Wuthering Heights,i guessed  by his preparations  that egress was allowed  and  leaving my hard couch  made a movement to follow him.
Wuthering Heights,he noticed this  and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade  intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go  if i changed my locality.
Wuthering Heights,it opened into the house  where the females were already astir  zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows  and mrs. heathcliff  kneeling on the hearth  reading a book by the aid of the blaze.
Wuthering Heights,she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes  and seemed absorbed in her occupation  desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks  or to push away a dog  now and then  that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.
Wuthering Heights,i was surprised to see heathcliff there also.
Wuthering Heights,he stood by the fire  his back towards me  just finishing a stormy scene with poor zillah  who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron  and heave an indignant groan.
Wuthering Heights,and you  you worthless      he broke out as i entered  turning to his daughter in law  and employing an epithet as harmless as duck  or sheep  but generally represented by a dash   .
Wuthering Heights,there you are  at your idle tricks again  the rest of them do earn their bread   you live on my charity  put your trash away  and find something to do.
Wuthering Heights,you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight   do you hear  damnable jade        i   ll put my trash away  because you can make me if i refuse    answered the young lady  closing her book  and throwing it on a chair.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ll not do anything  though you should swear your tongue out  except what i please     heathcliff lifted his hand  and the speaker sprang to a safer distance  obviously acquainted with its weight.
Wuthering Heights,having no desire to be entertained by a cat and dog combat  i stepped forward briskly  as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth  and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute.
Wuthering Heights,each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities  heathcliff placed his fists  out of temptation  in his pockets  mrs. heathcliff curled her lip  and walked to a seat far off  where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay.
Wuthering Heights,that was not long.
Wuthering Heights,i declined joining their breakfast  and  at the first gleam of dawn  took an opportunity of escaping into the free air  now clear  and still  and cold as impalpable ice.
Wuthering Heights,my landlord halloed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden  and offered to accompany me across the moor.
Wuthering Heights,it was well he did  for the whole hill back was one billowy  white ocean  the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground  many pits  at least  were filled to a level  and entire ranges of mounds  the refuse of the quarries  blotted from the chart which my yesterday   s walk left pictured in my mind.
Wuthering Heights,i had remarked on one side of the road  at intervals of six or seven yards  a line of upright stones  continued through the whole length of the barren  these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark  and also when a fall  like the present  confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path  but  excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there  all traces of their existence had vanished  and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left  when i imagined i was following  correctly  the windings of the road.
Wuthering Heights,we exchanged little conversation  and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park  saying  i could make no error there.
Wuthering Heights,our adieux were limited to a hasty bow  and then i pushed forward  trusting to my own resources  for the porter   s lodge is untenanted as yet.
Wuthering Heights,the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles  i believe i managed to make it four  what with losing myself among the trees  and sinking up to the neck in snow  a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate.
Wuthering Heights,at any rate  whatever were my wanderings  the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house  and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights.
Wuthering Heights,my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me  exclaiming  tumultuously  they had completely given me up  everybody conjectured that i perished last night  and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains.
Wuthering Heights,i bid them be quiet  now that they saw me returned  and  benumbed to my very heart  i dragged upstairs  whence  after putting on dry clothes  and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes  to restore the animal heat  i adjourned to my study  feeble as a kitten  almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.
Wuthering Heights,what vain weather cocks we are  i  who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse  and thanked my stars that  at length  i had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable   i  weak wretch  after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude  was finally compelled to strike my colours  and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment  i desired mrs. dean  when she brought in supper  to sit down while i ate it  hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip  and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.
Wuthering Heights,you have lived here a considerable time    i commenced     did you not say sixteen years        eighteen  sir  i came when the mistress was married  to wait on her  after she died  the master retained me for his housekeeper.
Wuthering Heights,indeed.
Wuthering Heights,there ensued a pause.
Wuthering Heights,she was not a gossip  i feared  unless about her own affairs  and those could hardly interest me.
Wuthering Heights,however  having studied for an interval  with a fist on either knee  and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance  she ejaculated      ah  times are greatly changed since then        yes    i remarked     you   ve seen a good many alterations  i suppose        i have  and troubles too    she said.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   ll turn the talk on my landlord   s family    i thought to myself.
Wuthering Heights,a good subject to start  and that pretty girl widow  i should like to know her history  whether she be a native of the country  or  as is more probable  an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognise for kin.
Wuthering Heights,with this intention i asked mrs. dean why heathcliff let thrushcross grange  and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior.
Wuthering Heights,is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,rich  sir    she returned.
Wuthering Heights,he has nobody knows what money  and every year it increases.
Wuthering Heights,yes  yes  he   s rich enough to live in a finer house than this  but he   s very near   close handed  and  if he had meant to flit to thrushcross grange  as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.
Wuthering Heights,it is strange people should be so greedy  when they are alone in the world        he had a son  it seems        yes  he had one   he is dead.
Wuthering Heights,and that young lady  mrs. heathcliff  is his widow        yes.
Wuthering Heights,where did she come from originally        why  sir  she is my late master   s daughter  catherine linton was her maiden name.
Wuthering Heights,i nursed her  poor thing  i did wish mr. heathcliff would remove here  and then we might have been together again.
Wuthering Heights,what  catherine linton    i exclaimed  astonished.
Wuthering Heights,but a minute   s reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine.
Wuthering Heights,then    i continued     my predecessor   s name was linton        it was.
Wuthering Heights,and who is that earnshaw  hareton earnshaw  who lives with mr. heathcliff  are they relations        no  he is the late mrs. linton   s nephew.
Wuthering Heights,the young lady   s cousin  then        yes  and her husband was her cousin also  one on the mother   s  the other on the father   s side  heathcliff married mr. linton   s sister.
Wuthering Heights,i see the house at wuthering heights has    earnshaw    carved over the front door.
Wuthering Heights,are they an old family        very old  sir  and hareton is the last of them  as our miss cathy is of us   i mean  of the lintons.
Wuthering Heights,have you been to wuthering heights  i beg pardon for asking  but i should like to hear how she is        mrs. heathcliff  she looked very well  and very handsome  yet  i think  not very happy.
Wuthering Heights,oh dear  i don   t wonder  and how did you like the master        a rough fellow  rather  mrs. dean.
Wuthering Heights,is not that his character        rough as a saw edge  and hard as whinstone  the less you meddle with him the better.
Wuthering Heights,he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.
Wuthering Heights,do you know anything of his history        it   s a cuckoo   s  sir   i know all about it  except where he was born  and who were his parents  and how he got his money at first.
Wuthering Heights,and hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock  the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.
Wuthering Heights,well  mrs. dean  it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours  i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed  so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.
Wuthering Heights,oh  certainly  sir  i   ll just fetch a little sewing  and then i   ll sit as long as you please.
Wuthering Heights,but you   ve caught cold  i saw you shivering  and you must have some gruel to drive it out.
Wuthering Heights,the worthy woman bustled off  and i crouched nearer the fire  my head felt hot  and the rest of me chill  moreover  i was excited  almost to a pitch of foolishness  through my nerves and brain.
Wuthering Heights,this caused me to feel  not uncomfortable  but rather fearful  as i am still  of serious effects from the incidents of to day and yesterday.
Wuthering Heights,she returned presently  bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work  and  having placed the former on the hob  drew in her seat  evidently pleased to find me so companionable.
Wuthering Heights,before i came to live here  she commenced   waiting no farther invitation to her story   i was almost always at wuthering heights  because my mother had nursed mr. hindley earnshaw  that was hareton   s father  and i got used to playing with the children  i ran errands too  and helped to make hay  and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to.
Wuthering Heights,one fine summer morning   it was the beginning of harvest  i remember   mr. earnshaw  the old master  came downstairs  dressed for a journey  and  after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day  he turned to hindley  and cathy  and me   for i sat eating my porridge with them   and he said  speaking to his son     now  my bonny man  i   m going to liverpool to day  what shall i bring you  you may choose what you like  only let it be little  for i shall walk there and back  sixty miles each way  that is a long spell    hindley named a fiddle  and then he asked miss cathy  she was hardly six years old  but she could ride any horse in the stable  and she chose a whip.
Wuthering Heights,he did not forget me  for he had a kind heart  though he was rather severe sometimes.
Wuthering Heights,he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears  and then he kissed his children  said good bye  and set off.
Wuthering Heights,it seemed a long while to us all   the three days of his absence   and often did little cathy ask when he would be home.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. earnshaw expected him by supper time on the third evening  and she put the meal off hour after hour  there were no signs of his coming  however  and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look.
Wuthering Heights,then it grew dark  she would have had them to bed  but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up  and  just about eleven o   clock  the door latch was raised quietly  and in stepped the master.
Wuthering Heights,he threw himself into a chair  laughing and groaning  and bid them all stand off  for he was nearly killed   he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.
Wuthering Heights,and at the end of it to be flighted to death    he said  opening his great coat  which he held bundled up in his arms.
Wuthering Heights,see here  wife  i was never so beaten with anything in my life  but you must e   en take it as a gift of god  though it   s as dark almost as if it came from the devil.
Wuthering Heights,we crowded round  and over miss cathy   s head i had a peep at a dirty  ragged  black haired child  big enough both to walk and talk  indeed  its face looked older than catherine   s  yet when it was set on its feet  it only stared round  and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand.
Wuthering Heights,i was frightened  and mrs. earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors  she did fly up  asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house  when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for  what he meant to do with it  and whether he were mad  the master tried to explain the matter  but he was really half dead with fatigue  and all that i could make out  amongst her scolding  was a tale of his seeing it starving  and houseless  and as good as dumb  in the streets of liverpool  where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.
Wuthering Heights,not a soul knew to whom it belonged  he said  and his money and time being both limited  he thought it better to take it home with him at once  than run into vain expenses there  because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it.
Wuthering Heights,well  the conclusion was  that my mistress grumbled herself calm  and mr. earnshaw told me to wash it  and give it clean things  and let it sleep with the children.
Wuthering Heights,hindley and cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored  then  both began searching their father   s pockets for the presents he had promised them.
Wuthering Heights,the former was a boy of fourteen  but when he drew out what had been a fiddle  crushed to morsels in the great coat  he blubbered aloud  and cathy  when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger  showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing  earning for her pains a sound blow from her father  to teach her cleaner manners.
Wuthering Heights,they entirely refused to have it in bed with them  or even in their room  and i had no more sense  so i put it on the landing of the stairs  hoping it might be gone on the morrow.
Wuthering Heights,by chance  or else attracted by hearing his voice  it crept to mr. earnshaw   s door  and there he found it on quitting his chamber.
Wuthering Heights,inquiries were made as to how it got there  i was obliged to confess  and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.
Wuthering Heights,this was heathcliff   s first introduction to the family.
Wuthering Heights,on coming back a few days afterwards  for i did not consider my banishment perpetual   i found they had christened him    heathcliff    it was the name of a son who died in childhood  and it has served him ever since  both for christian and surname.
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy and he were now very thick  but hindley hated him  and to say the truth i did the same  and we plagued and went on with him shamefully  for i wasn   t reasonable enough to feel my injustice  and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.
Wuthering Heights,he seemed a sullen  patient child  hardened  perhaps  to ill treatment  he would stand hindley   s blows without winking or shedding a tear  and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes  as if he had hurt himself by accident  and nobody was to blame.
Wuthering Heights,this endurance made old earnshaw furious  when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child  as he called him.
Wuthering Heights,he took to heathcliff strangely  believing all he said  for that matter  he said precious little  and generally the truth   and petting him up far above cathy  who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.
Wuthering Heights,so  from the very beginning  he bred bad feeling in the house  and at mrs. earnshaw   s death  which happened in less than two years after  the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend  and heathcliff as a usurper of his parent   s affections and his privileges  and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.
Wuthering Heights,i sympathised a while  but when the children fell ill of the measles  and i had to tend them  and take on me the cares of a woman at once  i changed my idea.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff was dangerously sick  and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow  i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him  and he hadn   t wit to guess that i was compelled to do it.
Wuthering Heights,however  i will say this  he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over.
Wuthering Heights,the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial.
Wuthering Heights,cathy and her brother harassed me terribly  he was as uncomplaining as a lamb  though hardness  not gentleness  made him give little trouble.
Wuthering Heights,he got through  and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me  and praised me for my care.
Wuthering Heights,i was vain of his commendations  and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them  and thus hindley lost his last ally  still i couldn   t dote on heathcliff  and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy  who never  to my recollection  repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.
Wuthering Heights,he was not insolent to his benefactor  he was simply insensible  though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart  and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.
Wuthering Heights,as an instance  i remember mr. earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair  and gave the lads each one.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff took the handsomest  but it soon fell lame  and when he discovered it  he said to hindley        you must exchange horses with me  i don   t like mine  and if you won   t i shall tell your father of the three thrashings you   ve given me this week  and show him my arm  which is black to the shoulder.
Wuthering Heights,hindley put out his tongue  and cuffed him over the ears.
Wuthering Heights,you   d better do it at once    he persisted  escaping to the porch  they were in the stable      you will have to  and if i speak of these blows  you   ll get them again with interest.
Wuthering Heights,off  dog    cried hindley  threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay.
Wuthering Heights,throw it    he replied  standing still     and then i   ll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died  and see whether he will not turn you out directly.
Wuthering Heights,hindley threw it  hitting him on the breast  and down he fell  but staggered up immediately  breathless and white  and  had not i prevented it  he would have gone just so to the master  and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him  intimating who had caused it.
Wuthering Heights,take my colt  gipsy  then    said young earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,and i pray that he may break your neck  take him  and be damned  you beggarly interloper  and wheedle my father out of all he has  only afterwards show him what you are  imp of satan.
Wuthering Heights,and take that  i hope he   ll kick out your brains     heathcliff had gone to loose the beast  and shift it to his own stall  he was passing behind it  when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet  and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled  ran away as fast as he could.
Wuthering Heights,i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up  and went on with his intention  exchanging saddles and all  and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned  before he entered the house.
Wuthering Heights,i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse  he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted.
Wuthering Heights,he complained so seldom  indeed  of such stirs as these  that i really thought him not vindictive  i was deceived completely  as you will hear.
Wuthering Heights,in the course of time mr. earnshaw began to fail.
Wuthering Heights,he had been active and healthy  yet his strength left him suddenly  and when he was confined to the chimney corner he grew grievously irritable.
Wuthering Heights,a nothing vexed him  and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits.
Wuthering Heights,this was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon  or domineer over  his favourite  he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him  seeming to have got into his head the notion that  because he liked heathcliff  all hated  and longed to do him an ill turn.
Wuthering Heights,it was a disadvantage to the lad  for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master  so we humoured his partiality  and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child   s pride and black tempers.
Wuthering Heights,still it became in a manner necessary  twice  or thrice  hindley   s manifestation of scorn  while his father was near  roused the old man to a fury  he seized his stick to strike him  and shook with rage that he could not do it.
Wuthering Heights,at last  our curate  we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws  and farming his bit of land himself  advised that the young man should be sent to college  and mr. earnshaw agreed  though with a heavy spirit  for he said      hindley was nought  and would never thrive as where he wandered.
Wuthering Heights,i hoped heartily we should have peace now.
Wuthering Heights,it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.
Wuthering Heights,i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements  as he would have it that it did  really  you know  sir  it was in his sinking frame.
Wuthering Heights,we might have got on tolerably  notwithstanding  but for two people   miss cathy  and joseph  the servant  you saw him  i daresay  up yonder.
Wuthering Heights,he was  and is yet most likely  the wearisomest self righteous pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours.
Wuthering Heights,by his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing  he contrived to make a great impression on mr. earnshaw  and the more feeble the master became  the more influence he gained.
Wuthering Heights,he was relentless in worrying him about his soul   s concerns  and about ruling his children rigidly.
Wuthering Heights,he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate  and  night after night  he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine  always minding to flatter earnshaw   s weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.
Wuthering Heights,certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before  and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day  from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed  we had not a minute   s security that she wouldn   t be in mischief.
Wuthering Heights,her spirits were always at high water mark  her tongue always going   singing  laughing  and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.
Wuthering Heights,a wild  wicked slip she was   but she had the bonniest eye  the sweetest smile  and lightest foot in the parish  and  after all  i believe she meant no harm  for when once she made you cry in good earnest  it seldom happened that she would not keep you company  and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her.
Wuthering Heights,she was much too fond of heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him  yet she got chided more than any of us on his account.
Wuthering Heights,in play  she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress  using her hands freely  and commanding her companions  she did so to me  but i would not bear slapping and ordering  and so i let her know.
Wuthering Heights,now  mr. earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children  he had always been strict and grave with them  and catherine  on her part  had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime.
Wuthering Heights,his peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him  she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once  and she defying us with her bold  saucy look  and her ready words  turning joseph   s religious curses into ridicule  baiting me  and doing just what her father hated most   showing how her pretended insolence  which he thought real  had more power over heathcliff than his kindness  how the boy would do her bidding in anything  and his only when it suited his own inclination.
Wuthering Heights,after behaving as badly as possible all day  she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night.
Wuthering Heights,nay  cathy    the old man would say     i cannot love thee  thou   rt worse than thy brother.
Wuthering Heights,go  say thy prayers  child  and ask god   s pardon.
Wuthering Heights,i doubt thy mother and i must rue that we ever reared thee    that made her cry  at first  and then being repulsed continually hardened her  and she laughed if i told her to say she was sorry for her faults  and beg to be forgiven.
Wuthering Heights,but the hour came  at last  that ended mr. earnshaw   s troubles on earth.
Wuthering Heights,he died quietly in his chair one october evening  seated by the fire side.
Wuthering Heights,a high wind blustered round the house  and roared in the chimney  it sounded wild and stormy  yet it was not cold  and we were all together   i  a little removed from the hearth  busy at my knitting  and joseph reading his bible near the table  for the servants generally sat in the house then  after their work was done .
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy had been sick  and that made her still  she leant against her father   s knee  and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.
Wuthering Heights,i remember the master  before he fell into a doze  stroking her bonny hair   it pleased him rarely to see her gentle   and saying     why canst thou not always be a good lass  cathy    and she turned her face up to his  and laughed  and answered     why cannot you always be a good man  father    but as soon as she saw him vexed again  she kissed his hand  and said she would sing him to sleep.
Wuthering Heights,she began singing very low  till his fingers dropped from hers  and his head sank on his breast.
Wuthering Heights,then i told her to hush  and not stir  for fear she should wake him.
Wuthering Heights,we all kept as mute as mice a full half hour  and should have done so longer  only joseph  having finished his chapter  got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed.
Wuthering Heights,he stepped forward  and called him by name  and touched his shoulder  but he would not move  so he took the candle and looked at him.
Wuthering Heights,i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light  and seizing the children each by an arm  whispered them to    frame upstairs  and make little din   they might pray alone that evening   he had summut to do.
Wuthering Heights,i shall bid father good night first    said catherine  putting her arms round his neck  before we could hinder her.
Wuthering Heights,the poor thing discovered her loss directly   she screamed out      oh  he   s dead  heathcliff  he   s dead    and they both set up a heart breaking cry.
Wuthering Heights,i joined my wail to theirs  loud and bitter  but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.
Wuthering Heights,he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.
Wuthering Heights,i could not guess the use that either would be of  then.
Wuthering Heights,however  i went  through wind and rain  and brought one  the doctor  back with me  the other said he would come in the morning.
Wuthering Heights,leaving joseph to explain matters  i ran to the children   s room  their door was ajar  i saw they had never lain down  though it was past midnight  but they were calmer  and did not need me to console them.
Wuthering Heights,the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on  no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did  in their innocent talk  and  while i sobbed and listened  i could not help wishing we were all there safe together.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hindley came home to the funeral  and   a thing that amazed us  and set the neighbours gossiping right and left   he brought a wife with him.
Wuthering Heights,what she was  and where she was born  he never informed us  probably  she had neither money nor name to recommend her  or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father.
Wuthering Heights,she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account.
Wuthering Heights,every object she saw  the moment she crossed the threshold  appeared to delight her  and every circumstance that took place about her  except the preparing for the burial  and the presence of the mourners.
Wuthering Heights,i thought she was half silly  from her behaviour while that went on  she ran into her chamber  and made me come with her  though i should have been dressing the children  and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands  and asking repeatedly      are they gone yet    then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black  and started  and trembled  and  at last  fell a weeping   and when i asked what was the matter  answered  she didn   t know  but she felt so afraid of dying  i imagined her as little likely to die as myself.
Wuthering Heights,she was rather thin  but young  and fresh complexioned  and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds.
Wuthering Heights,i did remark  to be sure  that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick  that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver  and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes  but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended  and had no impulse to sympathise with her.
Wuthering Heights,we don   t in general take to foreigners here  mr. lockwood  unless they take to us first.
Wuthering Heights,young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence.
Wuthering Heights,he had grown sparer  and lost his colour  and spoke and dressed quite differently  and  on the very day of his return  he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen  and leave the house for him.
Wuthering Heights,indeed  he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour  but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace  at the pewter dishes and delf case  and dog kennel  and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat  that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort  and so dropped the intention.
Wuthering Heights,she expressed pleasure  too  at finding a sister among her new acquaintance  and she prattled to catherine  and kissed her  and ran about with her  and gave her quantities of presents  at the beginning.
Wuthering Heights,her affection tired very soon  however  and when she grew peevish  hindley became tyrannical.
Wuthering Heights,a few words from her  evincing a dislike to heathcliff  were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.
Wuthering Heights,he drove him from their company to the servants  deprived him of the instructions of the curate  and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead  compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first  because cathy taught him what she learnt  and worked or played with him in the fields.
Wuthering Heights,they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages  the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved  and what they did  so they kept clear of him.
Wuthering Heights,he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays  only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves  and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging  and catherine a fast from dinner or supper.
Wuthering Heights,but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day  and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at.
Wuthering Heights,the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart  and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached  they forgot everything the minute they were together again  at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge  and many a time i   ve cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily  and i not daring to speak a syllable  for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures.
Wuthering Heights,one sunday evening  it chanced that they were banished from the sitting room  for making a noise  or a light offence of the kind  and when i went to call them to supper  i could discover them nowhere.
Wuthering Heights,we searched the house  above and below  and the yard and stables  they were invisible  and  at last  hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors  and swore nobody should let them in that night.
Wuthering Heights,the household went to bed  and i  too anxious to lie down  opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken  though it rained  determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition  should they return.
Wuthering Heights,in a while  i distinguished steps coming up the road  and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate.
Wuthering Heights,i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr. earnshaw by knocking.
Wuthering Heights,there was heathcliff  by himself  it gave me a start to see him alone.
Wuthering Heights,where is miss catherine    i cried hurriedly.
Wuthering Heights,no accident  i hope       at thrushcross grange    he answered     and i would have been there too  but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.
Wuthering Heights,well  you will catch it    i said     you   ll never be content till you   re sent about your business.
Wuthering Heights,what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange       let me get off my wet clothes  and i   ll tell you all about it  nelly    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,i bid him beware of rousing the master  and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle  he continued      cathy and i escaped from the wash house to have a ramble at liberty  and getting a glimpse of the grange lights  we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners  while their father and mother sat eating and drinking  and singing and laughing  and burning their eyes out before the fire.
Wuthering Heights,do you think they do  or reading sermons  and being catechised by their man servant  and set to learn a column of scripture names  if they don   t answer properly       probably not    i responded.
Wuthering Heights,they are good children  no doubt  and don   t deserve the treatment you receive  for your bad conduct.
Wuthering Heights,don   t cant  nelly    he said     nonsense  we ran from the top of the heights to the park  without stopping   catherine completely beaten in the race  because she was barefoot.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,we crept through a broken hedge  groped our way up the path  and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the drawing room window.
Wuthering Heights,the light came from thence  they had not put up the shutters  and the curtains were only half closed.
Wuthering Heights,both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement  and clinging to the ledge  and we saw   ah  it was beautiful   a splendid place carpeted with crimson  and crimson covered chairs and tables  and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold  a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre  and shimmering with little soft tapers.
Wuthering Heights,old mr. and mrs. linton were not there  edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves.
Wuthering Heights,shouldn   t they have been happy  we should have thought ourselves in heaven  and now  guess what your good children were doing  isabella   i believe she is eleven  a year younger than cathy   lay screaming at the farther end of the room  shrieking as if witches were running red hot needles into her.
Wuthering Heights,edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently  and in the middle of the table sat a little dog  shaking its paw and yelping  which  from their mutual accusations  we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.
Wuthering Heights,the idiots  that was their pleasure  to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair  and each begin to cry because both  after struggling to get it  refused to take it.
Wuthering Heights,we laughed outright at the petted things  we did despise them  when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted  or find us by ourselves  seeking entertainment in yelling  and sobbing  and rolling on the ground  divided by the whole room  i   d not exchange  for a thousand lives  my condition here  for edgar linton   s at thrushcross grange   not if i might have the privilege of flinging joseph off the highest gable  and painting the house front with hindley   s blood        hush  hush    i interrupted.
Wuthering Heights,still you have not told me  heathcliff  how catherine is left behind        i told you we laughed    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,the lintons heard us  and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door  there was silence  and then a cry     oh  mamma  mamma  oh  papa  oh  mamma  come here.
Wuthering Heights,oh  papa  oh     they really did howl out something in that way.
Wuthering Heights,we made frightful noises to terrify them still more  and then we dropped off the ledge  because somebody was drawing the bars  and we felt we had better flee.
Wuthering Heights,i had cathy by the hand  and was urging her on  when all at once she fell down.
Wuthering Heights,run  heathcliff  run     she whispered.
Wuthering Heights,they have let the bull dog loose  and he holds me     the devil had seized her ankle  nelly  i heard his abominable snorting.
Wuthering Heights,she did not yell out   no  she would have scorned to do it  if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow.
Wuthering Heights,i did  though  i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom  and i got a stone and thrust it between his jaws  and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat.
Wuthering Heights,a beast of a servant came up with a lantern  at last  shouting      keep fast  skulker  keep fast     he changed his note  however  when he saw skulker   s game.
Wuthering Heights,the dog was throttled off  his huge  purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth  and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver.
Wuthering Heights,the man took cathy up  she was sick  not from fear  i   m certain  but from pain.
Wuthering Heights,he carried her in  i followed  grumbling execrations and vengeance.
Wuthering Heights,what prey  robert     hallooed linton from the entrance.
Wuthering Heights,skulker has caught a little girl  sir     he replied     and there   s a lad here     he added  making a clutch at me     who looks an out and outer  very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep  that they might murder us at their ease.
Wuthering Heights,hold your tongue  you foul mouthed thief  you  you shall go to the gallows for this.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton  sir  don   t lay by your gun.
Wuthering Heights,no  no  robert     said the old fool.
Wuthering Heights,the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day  they thought to have me cleverly.
Wuthering Heights,come in  i   ll furnish them a reception.
Wuthering Heights,there  john  fasten the chain.
Wuthering Heights,give skulker some water  jenny.
Wuthering Heights,to beard a magistrate in his stronghold  and on the sabbath  too  where will their insolence stop  oh  my dear mary  look here  don   t be afraid  it is but a boy   yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face  would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once  before he shows his nature in acts as well as features     he pulled me under the chandelier  and mrs. linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror.
Wuthering Heights,the cowardly children crept nearer also  isabella lisping      frightful thing  put him in the cellar  papa.
Wuthering Heights,he   s exactly like the son of the fortune teller that stole my tame pheasant.
Wuthering Heights,isn   t he  edgar         while they examined me  cathy came round  she heard the last speech  and laughed.
Wuthering Heights,edgar linton  after an inquisitive stare  collected sufficient wit to recognise her.
Wuthering Heights,they see us at church  you know  though we seldom meet them elsewhere.
Wuthering Heights,that   s miss earnshaw     he whispered to his mother     and look how skulker has bitten her   how her foot bleeds            miss earnshaw  nonsense     cried the dame     miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy  and yet  my dear  the child is in mourning   surely it is   and she may be lamed for life            what culpable carelessness in her brother     exclaimed mr. linton  turning from me to catherine.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve understood from shielders       that was the curate  sir        that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.
Wuthering Heights,but who is this  where did she pick up this companion  oho  i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made  in his journey to liverpool   a little lascar  or an american or spanish castaway.
Wuthering Heights,a wicked boy  at all events     remarked the old lady     and quite unfit for a decent house  did you notice his language  linton  i   m shocked that my children should have heard it.
Wuthering Heights,i recommenced cursing   don   t be angry  nelly   and so robert was ordered to take me off.
Wuthering Heights,i refused to go without cathy  he dragged me into the garden  pushed the lantern into my hand  assured me that mr. earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour  and  bidding me march directly  secured the door again.
Wuthering Heights,the curtains were still looped up at one corner  and i resumed my station as spy  because  if catherine had wished to return  i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments  unless they let her out.
Wuthering Heights,she sat on the sofa quietly.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy maid which we had borrowed for our excursion  shaking her head and expostulating with her  i suppose  she was a young lady  and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine.
Wuthering Heights,then the woman servant brought a basin of warm water  and washed her feet  and mr. linton mixed a tumbler of negus  and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap  and edgar stood gaping at a distance.
Wuthering Heights,afterwards  they dried and combed her beautiful hair  and gave her a pair of enormous slippers  and wheeled her to the fire  and i left her  as merry as she could be  dividing her food between the little dog and skulker  whose nose she pinched as he ate  and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the lintons   a dim reflection from her own enchanting face.
Wuthering Heights,i saw they were full of stupid admiration  she is so immeasurably superior to them   to everybody on earth  is she not  nelly        there will more come of this business than you reckon on    i answered  covering him up and extinguishing the light.
Wuthering Heights,you are incurable  heathcliff  and mr. hindley will have to proceed to extremities  see if he won   t.   my words came truer than i desired.
Wuthering Heights,the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious.
Wuthering Heights,and then mr. linton  to mend matters  paid us a visit himself on the morrow  and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family  that he was stirred to look about him  in earnest.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff received no flogging  but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal  and mrs. earnshaw undertook to keep her sister in law in due restraint when she returned home  employing art  not force  with force she would have found it impossible.
Wuthering Heights,cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks  till christmas.
Wuthering Heights,by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured  and her manners much improved.
Wuthering Heights,the mistress visited her often in the interval  and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self respect with fine clothes and flattery  which she took readily  so that  instead of a wild  hatless little savage jumping into the house  and rushing to squeeze us all breathless  there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person  with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver  and a long cloth habit  which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in.
Wuthering Heights,hindley lifted her from her horse  exclaiming delightedly     why  cathy  you are quite a beauty  i should scarcely have known you  you look like a lady now.
Wuthering Heights,isabella linton is not to be compared with her  is she  frances       isabella has not her natural advantages    replied his wife     but she must mind and not grow wild again here.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  help miss catherine off with her things   stay  dear  you will disarrange your curls   let me untie your hat.
Wuthering Heights,i removed the habit  and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock  white trousers  and burnished shoes  and  while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her  she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.
Wuthering Heights,she kissed me gently  i was all flour making the christmas cake  and it would not have done to give me a hug  and then she looked round for heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,mr. and mrs. earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting  thinking it would enable them to judge  in some measure  what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff was hard to discover  at first.
Wuthering Heights,if he were careless  and uncared for  before catherine   s absence  he had been ten times more so since.
Wuthering Heights,nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy  and bid him wash himself  once a week  and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water.
Wuthering Heights,therefore  not to mention his clothes  which had seen three months    service in mire and dust  and his thick uncombed hair  the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded.
Wuthering Heights,he might well skulk behind the settle  on beholding such a bright  graceful damsel enter the house  instead of a rough headed counterpart of himself  as he expected.
Wuthering Heights,is heathcliff not here    she demanded  pulling off her gloves  and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  you may come forward    cried mr. hindley  enjoying his discomfiture  and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself.
Wuthering Heights,you may come and wish miss catherine welcome  like the other servants.
Wuthering Heights,cathy  catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment  flew to embrace him  she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second  and then stopped  and drawing back  burst into a laugh  exclaiming     why  how very black and cross you look  and how   how funny and grim  but that   s because i   m used to edgar and isabella linton.
Wuthering Heights,well  heathcliff  have you forgotten me     she had some reason to put the question  for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance  and kept him immovable.
Wuthering Heights,shake hands  heathcliff    said mr. earnshaw  condescendingly     once in a way  that is permitted.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not    replied the boy  finding his tongue at last     i shall not stand to be laughed at.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not bear it     and he would have broken from the circle  but miss cathy seized him again.
Wuthering Heights,i did not mean to laugh at you    she said     i could not hinder myself  heathcliff  shake hands at least  what are you sulky for  it was only that you looked odd.
Wuthering Heights,if you wash your face and brush your hair  it will be all right  but you are so dirty     she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own  and also at her dress  which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his.
Wuthering Heights,you needn   t have touched me    he answered  following her eye and snatching away his hand.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be as dirty as i please  and i like to be dirty  and i will be dirty.
Wuthering Heights,with that he dashed headforemost out of the room  amid the merriment of the master and mistress  and to the serious disturbance of catherine  who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper.
Wuthering Heights,after playing lady   s maid to the new comer  and putting my cakes in the oven  and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires  befitting christmas eve  i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols  all alone  regardless of joseph   s affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs.
Wuthering Heights,he had retired to private prayer in his chamber  and mr. and mrs. earnshaw were engaging missy   s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons  as an acknowledgment of their kindness.
Wuthering Heights,they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights  and the invitation had been accepted  on one condition  mrs. linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that    naughty swearing boy.
Wuthering Heights,under these circumstances i remained solitary.
Wuthering Heights,i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices  and admired the shining kitchen utensils  the polished clock  decked in holly  the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper  and above all  the speckless purity of my particular care   the scoured and well swept floor.
Wuthering Heights,i gave due inward applause to every object  and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied  and call me a cant lass  and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box  and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff  and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him  and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad   s situation now  and from singing i changed my mind to crying.
Wuthering Heights,it struck me soon  however  there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them  i got up and walked into the court to seek him.
Wuthering Heights,he was not far  i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable  and feeding the other beasts  according to custom.
Wuthering Heights,make haste  heathcliff    i said     the kitchen is so comfortable  and joseph is upstairs  make haste  and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out  and then you can sit together  with the whole hearth to yourselves  and have a long chatter till bedtime.
Wuthering Heights,he proceeded with his task  and never turned his head towards me.
Wuthering Heights,come   are you coming    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a little cake for each of you  nearly enough  and you   ll need half an hour   s donning.
Wuthering Heights,i waited five minutes  but getting no answer left him.
Wuthering Heights,catherine supped with her brother and sister in law  joseph and i joined at an unsociable meal  seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.
Wuthering Heights,his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.
Wuthering Heights,he managed to continue work till nine o   clock  and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber.
Wuthering Heights,cathy sat up late  having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends  she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one  but he was gone  and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him  and then went back.
Wuthering Heights,in the morning he rose early  and  as it was a holiday  carried his ill humour on to the moors  not re appearing till the family were departed for church.
Wuthering Heights,fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.
Wuthering Heights,he hung about me for a while  and having screwed up his courage  exclaimed abruptly      nelly  make me decent  i   m going to be good.
Wuthering Heights,high time  heathcliff    i said     you have grieved catherine  she   s sorry she ever came home  i daresay  it looks as if you envied her  because she is more thought of than you.
Wuthering Heights,the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him  but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.
Wuthering Heights,did she say she was grieved    he inquired  looking very serious.
Wuthering Heights,she cried when i told her you were off again this morning.
Wuthering Heights,well  i cried last night    he returned     and i had more reason to cry than she.
Wuthering Heights,yes  you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach    said i.
Wuthering Heights,proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.
Wuthering Heights,but  if you be ashamed of your touchiness  you must ask pardon  mind  when she comes in.
Wuthering Heights,you must go up and offer to kiss her  and say   you know best what to say  only do it heartily  and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress.
Wuthering Heights,and now  though i have dinner to get ready  i   ll steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you  and that he does.
Wuthering Heights,you are younger  and yet  i   ll be bound  you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders  you could knock him down in a twinkling  don   t you feel that you could     heathcliff   s face brightened a moment  then it was overcast afresh  and he sighed.
Wuthering Heights,but  nelly  if i knocked him down twenty times  that wouldn   t make him less handsome or me more so.
Wuthering Heights,i wish i had light hair and a fair skin  and was dressed and behaved as well  and had a chance of being as rich as he will be        and cried for mamma at every turn    i added     and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you  and sat at home all day for a shower of rain.
Wuthering Heights,oh  heathcliff  you are showing a poor spirit  come to the glass  and i   ll let you see what you should wish.
Wuthering Heights,do you mark those two lines between your eyes  and those thick brows  that  instead of rising arched  sink in the middle  and that couple of black fiends  so deeply buried  who never open their windows boldly  but lurk glinting under them  like devil   s spies  wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles  to raise your lids frankly  and change the fiends to confident  innocent angels  suspecting and doubting nothing  and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes.
Wuthering Heights,don   t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert  and yet hates all the world  as well as the kicker  for what it suffers.
Wuthering Heights,in other words  i must wish for edgar linton   s great blue eyes and even forehead    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,i do   and that won   t help me to them.
Wuthering Heights,a good heart will help you to a bonny face  my lad    i continued     if you were a regular black  and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly.
Wuthering Heights,and now that we   ve done washing  and combing  and sulking   tell me whether you don   t think yourself rather handsome  i   ll tell you  i do.
Wuthering Heights,you   re fit for a prince in disguise.
Wuthering Heights,who knows but your father was emperor of china  and your mother an indian queen  each of them able to buy up  with one week   s income  wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together  and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england.
Wuthering Heights,were i in your place  i would frame high notions of my birth  and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer     so i chattered on  and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant  when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.
Wuthering Heights,he ran to the window and i to the door  just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage  smothered in cloaks and furs  and the earnshaws dismount from their horses  they often rode to church in winter.
Wuthering Heights,catherine took a hand of each of the children  and brought them into the house and set them before the fire  which quickly put colour into their white faces.
Wuthering Heights,i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour  and he willingly obeyed  but ill luck would have it that  as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side  hindley opened it on the other.
Wuthering Heights,they met  and the master  irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful  or  perhaps  eager to keep his promise to mrs. linton  shoved him back with a sudden thrust  and angrily bade joseph    keep the fellow out of the room   send him into the garret till dinner is over.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit  if left alone with them a minute.
Wuthering Heights,nay  sir    i could not avoid answering     he   ll touch nothing  not he  and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.
Wuthering Heights,he shall have his share of my hand  if i catch him downstairs till dark    cried hindley.
Wuthering Heights,begone  you vagabond  what  you are attempting the coxcomb  are you  wait till i get hold of those elegant locks   see if i won   t pull them a bit longer        they are long enough already    observed master linton  peeping from the doorway     i wonder they don   t make his head ache.
Wuthering Heights,it   s like a colt   s mane over his eyes     he ventured this remark without any intention to insult  but heathcliff   s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate  even then  as a rival.
Wuthering Heights,he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce  the first thing that came under his gripe  and dashed it full against the speaker   s face and neck  who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber  where  doubtless  he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion  for he appeared red and breathless.
Wuthering Heights,i got the dish cloth  and rather spitefully scrubbed edgar   s nose and mouth  affirming it served him right for meddling.
Wuthering Heights,his sister began weeping to go home  and cathy stood by confounded  blushing for all.
Wuthering Heights,you should not have spoken to him    she expostulated with master linton.
Wuthering Heights,he was in a bad temper  and now you   ve spoilt your visit  and he   ll be flogged  i hate him to be flogged  i can   t eat my dinner.
Wuthering Heights,why did you speak to him  edgar        i didn   t    sobbed the youth  escaping from my hands  and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief.
Wuthering Heights,i promised mamma that i wouldn   t say one word to him  and i didn   t.       well  don   t cry    replied catherine  contemptuously     you   re not killed.
Wuthering Heights,don   t make more mischief  my brother is coming  be quiet  hush  isabella  has anybody hurt you        there  there  children   to your seats    cried hindley  bustling in.
Wuthering Heights,that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.
Wuthering Heights,next time  master edgar  take the law into your own fists   it will give you an appetite     the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.
Wuthering Heights,they were hungry after their ride  and easily consoled  since no real harm had befallen them.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls  and the mistress made them merry with lively talk.
Wuthering Heights,i waited behind her chair  and was pained to behold catherine  with dry eyes and an indifferent air  commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.
Wuthering Heights,an unfeeling child    i thought to myself     how lightly she dismisses her old playmate   s troubles.
Wuthering Heights,i could not have imagined her to be so selfish.
Wuthering Heights,she lifted a mouthful to her lips  then she set it down again  her cheeks flushed  and the tears gushed over them.
Wuthering Heights,she slipped her fork to the floor  and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.
Wuthering Heights,i did not call her unfeeling long  for i perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day  and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself  or paying a visit to heathcliff  who had been locked up by the master  as i discovered  on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals.
Wuthering Heights,in the evening we had a dance.
Wuthering Heights,cathy begged that he might be liberated then  as isabella linton had no partner  her entreaties were vain  and i was appointed to supply the deficiency.
Wuthering Heights,we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise  and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band  mustering fifteen strong  a trumpet  a trombone  clarionets  bassoons  french horns  and a bass viol  besides singers.
Wuthering Heights,they go the rounds of all the respectable houses  and receive contributions every christmas  and we esteemed it a first rate treat to hear them.
Wuthering Heights,after the usual carols had been sung  we set them to songs and glees.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. earnshaw loved the music  and so they gave us plenty.
Wuthering Heights,catherine loved it too  but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps  and she went up in the dark  i followed.
Wuthering Heights,they shut the house door below  never noting our absence  it was so full of people.
Wuthering Heights,she made no stay at the stairs    head  but mounted farther  to the garret where heathcliff was confined  and called him.
Wuthering Heights,he stubbornly declined answering for a while  she persevered  and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards.
Wuthering Heights,i let the poor things converse unmolested  till i supposed the songs were going to cease  and the singers to get some refreshment  then i clambered up the ladder to warn her.
Wuthering Heights,instead of finding her outside  i heard her voice within.
Wuthering Heights,the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret  along the roof  into the skylight of the other  and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again.
Wuthering Heights,when she did come  heathcliff came with her  and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen  as my fellow servant had gone to a neighbour   s  to be removed from the sound of our    devil   s psalmody    as it pleased him to call it.
Wuthering Heights,i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks  but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday   s dinner  i would wink at his cheating mr. hindley that once.
Wuthering Heights,he went down  i set him a stool by the fire  and offered him a quantity of good things  but he was sick and could eat little  and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away.
Wuthering Heights,he leant his two elbows on his knees  and his chin on his hands  and remained rapt in dumb meditation.
Wuthering Heights,on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts  he answered gravely      i   m trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t care how long i wait  if i can only do it at last.
Wuthering Heights,i hope he will not die before i do        for shame  heathcliff    said i.
Wuthering Heights,it is for god to punish wicked people  we should learn to forgive.
Wuthering Heights,no  god won   t have the satisfaction that i shall    he returned.
Wuthering Heights,i only wish i knew the best way  let me alone  and i   ll plan it out  while i   m thinking of that i don   t feel pain.
Wuthering Heights,but  mr. lockwood  i forget these tales cannot divert you.
Wuthering Heights,i   m annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate  and your gruel cold  and you nodding for bed  i could have told heathcliff   s history  all that you need hear  in half a dozen words.
Wuthering Heights,thus interrupting herself  the housekeeper rose  and proceeded to lay aside her sewing  but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth  and i was very far from nodding.
Wuthering Heights,sit still  mrs. dean    i cried     do sit still another half hour.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve done just right to tell the story leisurely.
Wuthering Heights,that is the method i like  and you must finish it in the same style.
Wuthering Heights,i am interested in every character you have mentioned  more or less.
Wuthering Heights,the clock is on the stroke of eleven  sir.
Wuthering Heights,no matter   i   m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.
Wuthering Heights,one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.
Wuthering Heights,you shouldn   t lie till ten.
Wuthering Heights,there   s the very prime of the morning gone long before that time.
Wuthering Heights,a person who has not done one half his day   s work by ten o   clock  runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.
Wuthering Heights,nevertheless  mrs. dean  resume your chair  because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon.
Wuthering Heights,i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold  at least.
Wuthering Heights,i hope not  sir.
Wuthering Heights,well  you must allow me to leap over some three years  during that space mrs. earnshaw          no  no  i   ll allow nothing of the sort  are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which  if you were seated alone  and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you  you would watch the operation so intently that puss   s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper        a terribly lazy mood  i should say.
Wuthering Heights,on the contrary  a tiresomely active one.
Wuthering Heights,it is mine  at present  and  therefore  continue minutely.
Wuthering Heights,i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage  to their various occupants  and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker on.
Wuthering Heights,they do live more in earnest  more in themselves  and less in surface  change  and frivolous external things.
Wuthering Heights,i could fancy a love for life here almost possible  and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year   s standing.
Wuthering Heights,one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish  on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice  the other  introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks  he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole  but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.
Wuthering Heights,oh  here we are the same as anywhere else  when you get to know us    observed mrs. dean  somewhat puzzled at my speech.
Wuthering Heights,excuse me    i responded     you  my good friend  are a striking evidence against that assertion.
Wuthering Heights,excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence  you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class.
Wuthering Heights,i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think.
Wuthering Heights,you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. dean laughed.
Wuthering Heights,i certainly esteem myself a steady  reasonable kind of body    she said     not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces  and one series of actions  from year   s end to year   s end  but i have undergone sharp discipline  which has taught me wisdom  and then  i have read more than you would fancy  mr. lockwood.
Wuthering Heights,you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into  and got something out of also  unless it be that range of greek and latin  and that of french  and those i know one from another  it is as much as you can expect of a poor man   s daughter.
Wuthering Heights,however  if i am to follow my story in true gossip   s fashion  i had better go on  and instead of leaping three years  i will be content to pass to the next summer   the summer of       that is nearly twenty three years ago.
Wuthering Heights,on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling  and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock  was born.
Wuthering Heights,we were busy with the hay in a far away field  when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane  calling me as she ran.
Wuthering Heights,oh  such a grand bairn    she panted out.
Wuthering Heights,the finest lad that ever breathed  but the doctor says missis must go  he says she   s been in a consumption these many months.
Wuthering Heights,i heard him tell mr. hindley  and now she has nothing to keep her  and she   ll be dead before winter.
Wuthering Heights,you must come home directly.
Wuthering Heights,you   re to nurse it  nelly  to feed it with sugar and milk  and take care of it day and night.
Wuthering Heights,i wish i were you  because it will be all yours when there is no missis        but is she very ill    i asked  flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet.
Wuthering Heights,i guess she is  yet she looks bravely    replied the girl     and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.
Wuthering Heights,she   s out of her head for joy  it   s such a beauty  if i were her i   m certain i should not die  i should get better at the bare sight of it  in spite of kenneth.
Wuthering Heights,i was fairly mad at him.
Wuthering Heights,dame archer brought the cherub down to master  in the house  and his face just began to light up  when the old croaker steps forward  and says he      earnshaw  it   s a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son.
Wuthering Heights,when she came  i felt convinced we shouldn   t keep her long  and now  i must tell you  the winter will probably finish her.
Wuthering Heights,don   t take on  and fret about it too much  it can   t be helped.
Wuthering Heights,and besides  you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass           and what did the master answer    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,i think he swore  but i didn   t mind him  i was straining to see the bairn    and she began again to describe it rapturously.
Wuthering Heights,i  as zealous as herself  hurried eagerly home to admire  on my part  though i was very sad for hindley   s sake.
Wuthering Heights,he had room in his heart only for two idols   his wife and himself  he doted on both  and adored one  and i couldn   t conceive how he would bear the loss.
Wuthering Heights,when we got to wuthering heights  there he stood at the front door  and  as i passed in  i asked     how was the baby        nearly ready to run about  nell    he replied  putting on a cheerful smile.
Wuthering Heights,and the mistress    i ventured to inquire     the doctor says she   s          damn the doctor    he interrupted  reddening.
Wuthering Heights,frances is quite right  she   ll be perfectly well by this time next week.
Wuthering Heights,are you going upstairs  will you tell her that i   ll come  if she   ll promise not to talk.
Wuthering Heights,i left her because she would not hold her tongue  and she must   tell her mr. kenneth says she must be quiet.
Wuthering Heights,i delivered this message to mrs. earnshaw  she seemed in flighty spirits  and replied merrily     i hardly spoke a word  ellen  and there he has gone out twice  crying.
Wuthering Heights,well  say i promise i won   t speak  but that does not bind me not to laugh at him     poor soul  till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her  and her husband persisted doggedly  nay  furiously  in affirming her health improved every day.
Wuthering Heights,when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady  and he needn   t put him to further expense by attending her  he retorted     i know you need not   she   s well   she does not want any more attendance from you  she never was in a consumption.
Wuthering Heights,it was a fever  and it is gone  her pulse is as slow as mine now  and her cheek as cool.
Wuthering Heights,he told his wife the same story  and she seemed to believe him  but one night  while leaning on his shoulder  in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to morrow  a fit of coughing took her   a very slight one   he raised her in his arms  she put her two hands about his neck  her face changed  and she was dead.
Wuthering Heights,as the girl had anticipated  the child hareton fell wholly into my hands.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw  provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry  was contented  as far as regarded him.
Wuthering Heights,for himself  he grew desperate  his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.
Wuthering Heights,he neither wept nor prayed  he cursed and defied  execrated god and man  and gave himself up to reckless dissipation.
Wuthering Heights,the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long  joseph and i were the only two that would stay.
Wuthering Heights,i had not the heart to leave my charge  and besides  you know  i had been his foster sister  and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would.
Wuthering Heights,joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers  and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.
Wuthering Heights,the master   s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint.
Wuthering Heights,and  truly  it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period.
Wuthering Heights,he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption  and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.
Wuthering Heights,i could not half tell what an infernal house we had.
Wuthering Heights,the curate dropped calling  and nobody decent came near us  at last  unless edgar linton   s visits to miss cathy might be an exception.
Wuthering Heights,at fifteen she was the queen of the country side  she had no peer  and she did turn out a haughty  headstrong creature  i own i did not like her  after infancy was past  and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance  she never took an aversion to me  though.
Wuthering Heights,she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments  even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably  and young linton  with all his superiority  found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.
Wuthering Heights,he was my late master  that is his portrait over the fireplace.
Wuthering Heights,it used to hang on one side  and his wife   s on the other  but hers has been removed  or else you might see something of what she was.
Wuthering Heights,can you make that out   mrs. dean raised the candle  and i discerned a soft featured face  exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights  but more pensive and amiable in expression.
Wuthering Heights,it formed a sweet picture.
Wuthering Heights,the long light hair curled slightly on the temples  the eyes were large and serious  the figure almost too graceful.
Wuthering Heights,i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual.
Wuthering Heights,i marvelled much how he  with a mind to correspond with his person  could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,a very agreeable portrait    i observed to the house keeper.
Wuthering Heights,is it like        yes    she answered     but he looked better when he was animated  that is his everyday countenance  he wanted spirit in general.
Wuthering Heights,catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks    residence among them  and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company  and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy  she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality  gained the admiration of isabella  and the heart and soul of her brother  acquisitions that flattered her from the first   for she was full of ambition   and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one.
Wuthering Heights,in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a    vulgar young ruffian    and    worse than a brute    she took care not to act like him  but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at  and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.
Wuthering Heights,mr. edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly.
Wuthering Heights,he had a terror of earnshaw   s reputation  and shrunk from encountering him  and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility  the master himself avoided offending him  knowing why he came  and if he could not be gracious  kept out of the way.
Wuthering Heights,i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine  she was not artful  never played the coquette  and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all  for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence  she could not half coincide  as she did in his absence  and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff  she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference  as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles  which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery.
Wuthering Heights,that sounds ill natured  but she was so proud  it became really impossible to pity her distresses  till she should be chastened into more humility.
Wuthering Heights,she did bring herself  finally  to confess  and to confide in me  there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hindley had gone from home one afternoon  and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it.
Wuthering Heights,he had reached the age of sixteen then  i think  and without having bad features  or being deficient in intellect  he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.
Wuthering Heights,in the first place  he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education  continual hard work  begun soon and concluded late  had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge  and any love for books or learning.
Wuthering Heights,his childhood   s sense of superiority  instilled into him by the favours of old mr. earnshaw  was faded away.
Wuthering Heights,he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies  and yielded with poignant though silent regret  but he yielded completely  and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward  when he found he must  necessarily  sink beneath his former level.
Wuthering Heights,then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration  he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look  his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness  and he took a grim pleasure  apparently  in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.
Wuthering Heights,catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour  but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words  and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses  as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him.
Wuthering Heights,on the before named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing  while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress  she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle  and imagining she would have the whole place to herself  she managed  by some means  to inform mr. edgar of her brother   s absence  and was then preparing to receive him.
Wuthering Heights,cathy  are you busy this afternoon    asked heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,are you going anywhere        no  it is raining    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,why have you that silk frock on  then    he said.
Wuthering Heights,nobody coming here  i hope        not that i know of    stammered miss     but you should be in the field now  heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,it is an hour past dinner time  i thought you were gone.
Wuthering Heights,hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence    observed the boy.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not work any more to day  i   ll stay with you.
Wuthering Heights,oh  but joseph will tell    she suggested     you   d better go        joseph is loading lime on the further side of penistone crags  it will take him till dark  and he   ll never know.
Wuthering Heights,so saying  he lounged to the fire  and sat down.
Wuthering Heights,catherine reflected an instant  with knitted brows   she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion.
Wuthering Heights,isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon    she said  at the conclusion of a minute   s silence.
Wuthering Heights,as it rains  i hardly expect them  but they may come  and if they do  you run the risk of being scolded for no good.
Wuthering Heights,order ellen to say you are engaged  cathy    he persisted     don   t turn me out for those pitiful  silly friends of yours  i   m on the point  sometimes  of complaining that they   but i   ll not          that they what    cried catherine  gazing at him with a troubled countenance.
Wuthering Heights,oh  nelly    she added petulantly  jerking her head away from my hands     you   ve combed my hair quite out of curl  that   s enough  let me alone.
Wuthering Heights,what are you on the point of complaining about  heathcliff        nothing   only look at the almanack on that wall    he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window  and continued     the crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons  the dots for those spent with me.
Wuthering Heights,do you see  i   ve marked every day.
Wuthering Heights,yes   very foolish  as if i took notice    replied catherine  in a peevish tone.
Wuthering Heights,and where is the sense of that        to show that i do take notice    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,and should i always be sitting with you    she demanded  growing more irritated.
Wuthering Heights,what good do i get  what do you talk about  you might be dumb  or a baby  for anything you say to amuse me  or for anything you do  either        you never told me before that i talked too little  or that you disliked my company  cathy    exclaimed heathcliff  in much agitation.
Wuthering Heights,it   s no company at all  when people know nothing and say nothing    she muttered.
Wuthering Heights,her companion rose up  but he hadn   t time to express his feelings further  for a horse   s feet were heard on the flags  and having knocked gently  young linton entered  his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received.
Wuthering Heights,doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends  as one came in and the other went out.
Wuthering Heights,the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak  hilly  coal country for a beautiful fertile valley  and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.
Wuthering Heights,he had a sweet  low manner of speaking  and pronounced his words as you do  that   s less gruff than we talk here  and softer.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not come too soon  am i    he said  casting a look at me  i had begun to wipe the plate  and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.
Wuthering Heights,no    answered catherine.
Wuthering Heights,what are you doing there  nelly        my work  miss    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits linton chose to pay.
Wuthering Heights,she stepped behind me and whispered crossly     take yourself and your dusters off  when company are in the house  servants don   t commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are        it   s a good opportunity  now that master is away    i answered aloud     he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.
Wuthering Heights,i   m sure mr. edgar will excuse me.
Wuthering Heights,i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence    exclaimed the young lady imperiously  not allowing her guest time to speak  she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i   m sorry for it  miss catherine    was my response  and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation.
Wuthering Heights,she  supposing edgar could not see her  snatched the cloth from my hand  and pinched me  with a prolonged wrench  very spitefully on the arm.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve said i did not love her  and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then  besides  she hurt me extremely  so i started up from my knees  and screamed out     oh  miss  that   s a nasty trick  you have no right to nip me  and i   m not going to bear it.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t touch you  you lying creature    cried she  her fingers tingling to repeat the act  and her ears red with rage.
Wuthering Heights,she never had power to conceal her passion  it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.
Wuthering Heights,what   s that  then    i retorted  showing a decided purple witness to refute her.
Wuthering Heights,she stamped her foot  wavered a moment  and then  irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her  slapped me on the cheek  a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  love  catherine    interposed linton  greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.
Wuthering Heights,leave the room  ellen    she repeated  trembling all over.
Wuthering Heights,little hareton  who followed me everywhere  and was sitting near me on the floor  at seeing my tears commenced crying himself  and sobbed out complaints against    wicked aunt cathy    which drew her fury on to his unlucky head  she seized his shoulders  and shook him till the poor child waxed livid  and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him.
Wuthering Heights,in an instant one was wrung free  and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.
Wuthering Heights,he drew back in consternation.
Wuthering Heights,i lifted hareton in my arms  and walked off to the kitchen with him  leaving the door of communication open  for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement.
Wuthering Heights,the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat  pale and with a quivering lip.
Wuthering Heights,that   s right    i said to myself.
Wuthering Heights,take warning and begone  it   s a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.
Wuthering Heights,where are you going    demanded catherine  advancing to the door.
Wuthering Heights,he swerved aside  and attempted to pass.
Wuthering Heights,you must not go    she exclaimed  energetically.
Wuthering Heights,i must and shall    he replied in a subdued voice.
Wuthering Heights,no    she persisted  grasping the handle     not yet  edgar linton  sit down  you shall not leave me in that temper.
Wuthering Heights,i should be miserable all night  and i won   t be miserable for you        can i stay after you have struck me    asked linton.
Wuthering Heights,catherine was mute.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve made me afraid and ashamed of you    he continued     i   ll not come here again     her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.
Wuthering Heights,and you told a deliberate untruth    he said.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t    she cried  recovering her speech     i did nothing deliberately.
Wuthering Heights,well  go  if you please   get away  and now i   ll cry   i   ll cry myself sick     she dropped down on her knees by a chair  and set to weeping in serious earnest.
Wuthering Heights,edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court  there he lingered.
Wuthering Heights,i resolved to encourage him.
Wuthering Heights,miss is dreadfully wayward  sir    i called out.
Wuthering Heights,as bad as any marred child  you   d better be riding home  or else she will be sick  only to grieve us.
Wuthering Heights,the soft thing looked askance through the window  he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed  or a bird half eaten.
Wuthering Heights,ah  i thought  there will be no saving him  he   s doomed  and flies to his fate  and so it was  he turned abruptly  hastened into the house again  shut the door behind him  and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk  ready to pull the whole place about our ears  his ordinary frame of mind in that condition   i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy   had broken the outworks of youthful timidity  and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship  and confess themselves lovers.
Wuthering Heights,intelligence of mr. hindley   s arrival drove linton speedily to his horse  and catherine to her chamber.
Wuthering Heights,i went to hide little hareton  and to take the shot out of the master   s fowling piece  which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement  to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked  or even attracted his notice too much  and i had hit upon the plan of removing it  that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.
Wuthering Heights,he entered  vociferating oaths dreadful to hear  and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.
Wuthering Heights,hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast   s fondness or his madman   s rage  for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death  and in the other of being flung into the fire  or dashed against the wall  and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever i chose to put him.
Wuthering Heights,there  i   ve found it out at last    cried hindley  pulling me back by the skin of my neck  like a dog.
Wuthering Heights,by heaven and hell  you   ve sworn between you to murder that child  i know how it is  now  that he is always out of my way.
Wuthering Heights,but  with the help of satan  i shall make you swallow the carving knife  nelly  you needn   t laugh  for i   ve just crammed kenneth  head downmost  in the black horse marsh  and two is the same as one   and i want to kill some of you  i shall have no rest till i do        but i don   t like the carving knife  mr. hindley    i answered     it has been cutting red herrings.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather be shot  if you please.
Wuthering Heights,you   d rather be damned    he said     and so you shall.
Wuthering Heights,no law in england can hinder a man from keeping his house decent  and mine   s abominable  open your mouth.
Wuthering Heights,he held the knife in his hand  and pushed its point between my teeth  but  for my part  i was never much afraid of his vagaries.
Wuthering Heights,i spat out  and affirmed it tasted detestably   i would not take it on any account.
Wuthering Heights,oh    said he  releasing me     i see that hideous little villain is not hareton  i beg your pardon  nell.
Wuthering Heights,if it be  he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me  and for screaming as if i were a goblin.
Wuthering Heights,unnatural cub  come hither  i   ll teach thee to impose on a good hearted  deluded father.
Wuthering Heights,now  don   t you think the lad would be handsomer cropped  it makes a dog fiercer  and i love something fierce   get me a scissors   something fierce and trim  besides  it   s infernal affectation   devilish conceit it is  to cherish our ears   we   re asses enough without them.
Wuthering Heights,hush  child  hush  well then  it is my darling  wisht  dry thy eyes   there   s a joy  kiss me.
Wuthering Heights,what  it won   t  kiss me  hareton  damn thee  kiss me  by god  as if i would rear such a monster  as sure as i   m living  i   ll break the brat   s neck.
Wuthering Heights,poor hareton was squalling and kicking in his father   s arms with all his might  and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the banister.
Wuthering Heights,i cried out that he would frighten the child into fits  and ran to rescue him.
Wuthering Heights,as i reached them  hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below  almost forgetting what he had in his hands.
Wuthering Heights,who is that    he asked  hearing some one approaching the stairs    foot.
Wuthering Heights,i leant forward also  for the purpose of signing to heathcliff  whose step i recognised  not to come further  and  at the instant when my eye quitted hareton  he gave a sudden spring  delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him  and fell.
Wuthering Heights,there was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment  by a natural impulse he arrested his descent  and setting him on his feet  looked up to discover the author of the accident.
Wuthering Heights,a miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings  and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds  could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of mr. earnshaw above.
Wuthering Heights,it expressed  plainer than words could do  the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge.
Wuthering Heights,had it been dark  i daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing hareton   s skull on the steps  but  we witnessed his salvation  and i was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart.
Wuthering Heights,hindley descended more leisurely  sobered and abashed.
Wuthering Heights,it is your fault  ellen    he said     you should have kept him out of sight  you should have taken him from me  is he injured anywhere        injured    i cried angrily     if he is not killed  he   ll be an idiot  oh  i wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.
Wuthering Heights,you   re worse than a heathen   treating your own flesh and blood in that manner     he attempted to touch the child  who  on finding himself with me  sobbed off his terror directly.
Wuthering Heights,at the first finger his father laid on him  however  he shrieked again louder than before  and struggled as if he would go into convulsions.
Wuthering Heights,you shall not meddle with him    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,he hates you   they all hate you   that   s the truth  a happy family you have  and a pretty state you   re come to        i shall come to a prettier  yet  nelly    laughed the misguided man  recovering his hardness.
Wuthering Heights,at present  convey yourself and him away.
Wuthering Heights,and hark you  heathcliff  clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.
Wuthering Heights,i wouldn   t murder you to night  unless  perhaps  i set the house on fire  but that   s as my fancy goes.
Wuthering Heights,while saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser  and poured some into a tumbler.
Wuthering Heights,nay  don   t    i entreated.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hindley  do take warning.
Wuthering Heights,have mercy on this unfortunate boy  if you care nothing for yourself        any one will do better for him than i shall    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,have mercy on your own soul    i said  endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.
Wuthering Heights,not i  on the contrary  i shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its maker    exclaimed the blasphemer.
Wuthering Heights,here   s to its hearty damnation     he drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go  terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink    observed heathcliff  muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.
Wuthering Heights,he   s doing his very utmost  but his constitution defies him.
Wuthering Heights,mr. kenneth says he would wager his mare that he   ll outlive any man on this side gimmerton  and go to the grave a hoary sinner  unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.
Wuthering Heights,i went into the kitchen  and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  as i thought  walked through to the barn.
Wuthering Heights,it turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle  when he flung himself on a bench by the wall  removed from the fire  and remained silent.
Wuthering Heights,i was rocking hareton on my knee  and humming a song that began      it was far in the night  and the bairnies grat  the mither beneath the mools heard that   when miss cathy  who had listened to the hubbub from her room  put her head in  and whispered       are you alone  nelly        yes  miss    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,she entered and approached the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,i  supposing she was going to say something  looked up.
Wuthering Heights,the expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious.
Wuthering Heights,her lips were half asunder  as if she meant to speak  and she drew a breath  but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.
Wuthering Heights,i resumed my song  not having forgotten her recent behaviour.
Wuthering Heights,where   s heathcliff    she said  interrupting me.
Wuthering Heights,about his work in the stable    was my answer.
Wuthering Heights,he did not contradict me  perhaps he had fallen into a doze.
Wuthering Heights,there followed another long pause  during which i perceived a drop or two trickle from catherine   s cheek to the flags.
Wuthering Heights,is she sorry for her shameful conduct    i asked myself.
Wuthering Heights,that will be a novelty  but she may come to the point as she will   i sha   n   t help her  no  she felt small trouble regarding any subject  save her own concerns.
Wuthering Heights,oh  dear    she cried at last.
Wuthering Heights,i   m very unhappy        a pity    observed i.
Wuthering Heights,you   re hard to please  so many friends and so few cares  and can   t make yourself content        nelly  will you keep a secret for me    she pursued  kneeling down by me  and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper  even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it.
Wuthering Heights,is it worth keeping    i inquired  less sulkily.
Wuthering Heights,yes  and it worries me  and i must let it out  i want to know what i should do.
Wuthering Heights,to day  edgar linton has asked me to marry him  and i   ve given him an answer.
Wuthering Heights,now  before i tell you whether it was a consent or denial  you tell me which it ought to have been.
Wuthering Heights,really  miss catherine  how can i know    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,to be sure  considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon  i might say it would be wise to refuse him  since he asked you after that  he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.
Wuthering Heights,if you talk so  i won   t tell you any more    she returned  peevishly rising to her feet.
Wuthering Heights,i accepted him  nelly.
Wuthering Heights,be quick  and say whether i was wrong        you accepted him  then what good is it discussing the matter  you have pledged your word  and cannot retract.
Wuthering Heights,but say whether i should have done so   do    she exclaimed in an irritated tone  chafing her hands together  and frowning.
Wuthering Heights,there are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly    i said  sententiously.
Wuthering Heights,first and foremost  do you love mr. edgar        who can help it  of course i do    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,then i put her through the following catechism  for a girl of twenty two it was not injudicious.
Wuthering Heights,why do you love him  miss cathy        nonsense  i do   that   s sufficient.
Wuthering Heights,by no means  you must say why        well  because he is handsome  and pleasant to be with.
Wuthering Heights,bad    was my commentary.
Wuthering Heights,and because he is young and cheerful.
Wuthering Heights,bad  still.
Wuthering Heights,and because he loves me.
Wuthering Heights,indifferent  coming there.
Wuthering Heights,and he will be rich  and i shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood  and i shall be proud of having such a husband.
Wuthering Heights,worst of all.
Wuthering Heights,and now  say how you love him        as everybody loves   you   re silly  nelly.
Wuthering Heights,not at all   answer.
Wuthering Heights,i love the ground under his feet  and the air over his head  and everything he touches  and every word he says.
Wuthering Heights,i love all his looks  and all his actions  and him entirely and altogether.
Wuthering Heights,there now        and why        nay  you are making a jest of it  it is exceedingly ill natured  it   s no jest to me    said the young lady  scowling  and turning her face to the fire.
Wuthering Heights,i   m very far from jesting  miss catherine    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,you love mr. edgar because he is handsome  and young  and cheerful  and rich  and loves you.
Wuthering Heights,the last  however  goes for nothing  you would love him without that  probably  and with it you wouldn   t  unless he possessed the four former attractions.
Wuthering Heights,no  to be sure not  i should only pity him   hate him  perhaps  if he were ugly  and a clown.
Wuthering Heights,but there are several other handsome  rich young men in the world  handsomer  possibly  and richer than he is.
Wuthering Heights,what should hinder you from loving them        if there be any  they are out of my way  i   ve seen none like edgar.
Wuthering Heights,you may see some  and he won   t always be handsome  and young  and may not always be rich.
Wuthering Heights,he is now  and i have only to do with the present.
Wuthering Heights,i wish you would speak rationally.
Wuthering Heights,well  that settles it  if you have only to do with the present  marry mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t want your permission for that   i shall marry him  and yet you have not told me whether i   m right.
Wuthering Heights,perfectly right  if people be right to marry only for the present.
Wuthering Heights,and now  let us hear what you are unhappy about.
Wuthering Heights,your brother will be pleased  the old lady and gentleman will not object  i think  you will escape from a disorderly  comfortless home into a wealthy  respectable one  and you love edgar  and edgar loves you.
Wuthering Heights,all seems smooth and easy  where is the obstacle        here  and here    replied catherine  striking one hand on her forehead  and the other on her breast     in whichever place the soul lives.
Wuthering Heights,in my soul and in my heart  i   m convinced i   m wrong        that   s very strange  i cannot make it out.
Wuthering Heights,it   s my secret.
Wuthering Heights,but if you will not mock at me  i   ll explain it  i can   t do it distinctly  but i   ll give you a feeling of how i feel.
Wuthering Heights,she seated herself by me again  her countenance grew sadder and graver  and her clasped hands trembled.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  do you never dream queer dreams    she said  suddenly  after some minutes    reflection.
Wuthering Heights,yes  now and then    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,and so do i. i   ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after  and changed my ideas  they   ve gone through and through me  like wine through water  and altered the colour of my mind.
Wuthering Heights,and this is one  i   m going to tell it   but take care not to smile at any part of it.
Wuthering Heights,oh  don   t  miss catherine    i cried.
Wuthering Heights,we   re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.
Wuthering Heights,come  come  be merry and like yourself  look at little hareton  he   s dreaming nothing dreary.
Wuthering Heights,how sweetly he smiles in his sleep        yes  and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude  you remember him  i daresay  when he was just such another as that chubby thing  nearly as young and innocent.
Wuthering Heights,however  nelly  i shall oblige you to listen  it   s not long  and i   ve no power to be merry to night.
Wuthering Heights,i won   t hear it  i won   t hear it    i repeated  hastily.
Wuthering Heights,i was superstitious about dreams then  and am still  and catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect  that made me dread something from which i might shape a prophecy  and foresee a fearful catastrophe.
Wuthering Heights,she was vexed  but she did not proceed.
Wuthering Heights,apparently taking up another subject  she recommenced in a short time.
Wuthering Heights,if i were in heaven  nelly  i should be extremely miserable.
Wuthering Heights,because you are not fit to go there    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,all sinners would be miserable in heaven.
Wuthering Heights,but it is not for that.
Wuthering Heights,i dreamt once that i was there.
Wuthering Heights,i tell you i won   t hearken to your dreams  miss catherine  i   ll go to bed    i interrupted again.
Wuthering Heights,she laughed  and held me down  for i made a motion to leave my chair.
Wuthering Heights,this is nothing    cried she     i was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home  and i broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth  and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of wuthering heights  where i woke sobbing for joy.
Wuthering Heights,that will do to explain my secret  as well as the other.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve no more business to marry edgar linton than i have to be in heaven  and if the wicked man in there had not brought heathcliff so low  i shouldn   t have thought of it.
Wuthering Heights,it would degrade me to marry heathcliff now  so he shall never know how i love him  and that  not because he   s handsome  nelly  but because he   s more myself than i am.
Wuthering Heights,whatever our souls are made of  his and mine are the same  and linton   s is as different as a moonbeam from lightning  or frost from fire.
Wuthering Heights,ere this speech ended i became sensible of heathcliff   s presence.
Wuthering Heights,having noticed a slight movement  i turned my head  and saw him rise from the bench  and steal out noiselessly.
Wuthering Heights,he had listened till he heard catherine say it would degrade her to marry him  and then he stayed to hear no further.
Wuthering Heights,my companion  sitting on the ground  was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure  but i started  and bade her hush      why    she asked  gazing nervously round.
Wuthering Heights,joseph is here    i answered  catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road     and heathcliff will come in with him.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.
Wuthering Heights,oh  he couldn   t overhear me at the door    said she.
Wuthering Heights,give me hareton  while you get the supper  and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.
Wuthering Heights,i want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience  and be convinced that heathcliff has no notion of these things.
Wuthering Heights,he has not  has he  he does not know what being in love is        i see no reason that he should not know  as well as you    i returned     and if you are his choice  he   ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born  as soon as you become mrs. linton  he loses friend  and love  and all  have you considered how you   ll bear the separation  and how he   ll bear to be quite deserted in the world  because  miss catherine          he quite deserted  we separated    she exclaimed  with an accent of indignation.
Wuthering Heights,who is to separate us  pray  they   ll meet the fate of milo  not as long as i live  ellen  for no mortal creature.
Wuthering Heights,every linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before i could consent to forsake heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,oh  that   s not what i intend   that   s not what i mean  i shouldn   t be mrs. linton were such a price demanded  he   ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.
Wuthering Heights,edgar must shake off his antipathy  and tolerate him  at least.
Wuthering Heights,he will  when he learns my true feelings towards him.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  i see now you think me a selfish wretch  but did it never strike you that if heathcliff and i married  we should be beggars  whereas  if i marry linton i can aid heathcliff to rise  and place him out of my brother   s power.
Wuthering Heights,with your husband   s money  miss catherine    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon  and  though i   m hardly a judge  i think that   s the worst motive you   ve given yet for being the wife of young linton.
Wuthering Heights,it is not    retorted she     it is the best  the others were the satisfaction of my whims  and for edgar   s sake  too  to satisfy him.
Wuthering Heights,this is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to edgar and myself.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot express it  but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you.
Wuthering Heights,what were the use of my creation  if i were entirely contained here  my great miseries in this world have been heathcliff   s miseries  and i watched and felt each from the beginning  my great thought in living is himself.
Wuthering Heights,if all else perished  and he remained  i should still continue to be  and if all else remained  and he were annihilated  the universe would turn to a mighty stranger  i should not seem a part of it.
Wuthering Heights,my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods  time will change it  i   m well aware  as winter changes the trees.
Wuthering Heights,my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath  a source of little visible delight  but necessary.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  i am heathcliff  he   s always  always in my mind  not as a pleasure  any more than i am always a pleasure to myself  but as my own being.
Wuthering Heights,so don   t talk of our separation again  it is impracticable  and       she paused  and hid her face in the folds of my gown  but i jerked it forcibly away.
Wuthering Heights,i was out of patience with her folly      if i can make any sense of your nonsense  miss    i said     it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying  or else that you are a wicked  unprincipled girl.
Wuthering Heights,but trouble me with no more secrets  i   ll not promise to keep them.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll keep that    she asked  eagerly.
Wuthering Heights,no  i   ll not promise    i repeated.
Wuthering Heights,she was about to insist  when the entrance of joseph finished our conversation  and catherine removed her seat to a corner  and nursed hareton  while i made the supper.
Wuthering Heights,after it was cooked  my fellow servant and i began to quarrel who should carry some to mr. hindley  and we didn   t settle it till all was nearly cold.
Wuthering Heights,then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask  if he wanted any  for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.
Wuthering Heights,and how isn   t that nowt comed in fro    th    field  be this time  what is he about  girt idle seeght    demanded the old man  looking round for heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll call him    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,he   s in the barn  i   ve no doubt.
Wuthering Heights,i went and called  but got no answer.
Wuthering Heights,on returning  i whispered to catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said  i was sure  and told how i saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother   s conduct regarding him.
Wuthering Heights,she jumped up in a fine fright  flung hareton on to the settle  and ran to seek for her friend herself  not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried  or how her talk would have affected him.
Wuthering Heights,she was absent such a while that joseph proposed we should wait no longer.
Wuthering Heights,he cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.
Wuthering Heights,they were    ill eneugh for ony fahl manners    he affirmed.
Wuthering Heights,and on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter of an hour   s supplication before meat  and would have tacked another to the end of the grace  had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road  and  wherever heathcliff had rambled  find and make him re enter directly      i want to speak to him  and i must  before i go upstairs    she said.
Wuthering Heights,and the gate is open  he is somewhere out of hearing  for he would not reply  though i shouted at the top of the fold as loud as i could.
Wuthering Heights,joseph objected at first  she was too much in earnest  however  to suffer contradiction  and at last he placed his hat on his head  and walked grumbling forth.
Wuthering Heights,meantime  catherine paced up and down the floor  exclaiming      i wonder where he is   i wonder where he can be  what did i say  nelly  i   ve forgotten.
Wuthering Heights,was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon  dear  tell me what i   ve said to grieve him  i do wish he   d come.
Wuthering Heights,i do wish he would        what a noise for nothing    i cried  though rather uneasy myself.
Wuthering Heights,what a trifle scares you  it   s surely no great cause of alarm that heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors  or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay loft.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll engage he   s lurking there.
Wuthering Heights,see if i don   t ferret him out     i departed to renew my search  its result was disappointment  and joseph   s quest ended in the same.
Wuthering Heights,yon lad gets war und war    observed he on re entering.
Wuthering Heights,he   s left th    gate at t    full swing  and miss   s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o    corn  and plottered through  raight o   er into t    meadow  hahsomdiver  t    maister    ull play t    devil to morn  and he   ll do weel.
Wuthering Heights,he   s patience itsseln wi    sich careless  offald craters   patience itsseln he is  bud he   ll not be soa allus   yah   s see  all on ye  yah mun   n   t drive him out of his heead for nowt        have you found heathcliff  you ass    interrupted catherine.
Wuthering Heights,have you been looking for him  as i ordered        i sud more likker look for th    horse    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,it    ud be to more sense.
Wuthering Heights,bud i can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this   as black as t    chimbley  und heathcliff   s noan t    chap to coom at my whistle   happen he   ll be less hard o    hearing wi    ye     it was a very dark evening for summer  the clouds appeared inclined to thunder  and i said we had better all sit down  the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble.
Wuthering Heights,however  catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.
Wuthering Heights,she kept wandering to and fro  from the gate to the door  in a state of agitation which permitted no repose  and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall  near the road  where  heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder  and the great drops that began to plash around her  she remained  calling at intervals  and then listening  and then crying outright.
Wuthering Heights,she beat hareton  or any child  at a good passionate fit of crying.
Wuthering Heights,about midnight  while we still sat up  the storm came rattling over the heights in full fury.
Wuthering Heights,there was a violent wind  as well as thunder  and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building  a huge bough fell across the roof  and knocked down a portion of the east chimney stack  sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen fire.
Wuthering Heights,we thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us  and joseph swung on to his knees  beseeching the lord to remember the patriarchs noah and lot  and  as in former times  spare the righteous  though he smote the ungodly.
Wuthering Heights,i felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also.
Wuthering Heights,the jonah  in my mind  was mr. earnshaw  and i shook the handle of his den that i might ascertain if he were yet living.
Wuthering Heights,he replied audibly enough  in a fashion which made my companion vociferate  more clamorously than before  that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.
Wuthering Heights,but the uproar passed away in twenty minutes  leaving us all unharmed  excepting cathy  who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter  and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes.
Wuthering Heights,she came in and lay down on the settle  all soaked as she was  turning her face to the back  and putting her hands before it.
Wuthering Heights,well  miss    i exclaimed  touching her shoulder     you are not bent on getting your death  are you  do you know what o   clock it is  half past twelve.
Wuthering Heights,come  come to bed  there   s no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy  he   ll be gone to gimmerton  and he   ll stay there now.
Wuthering Heights,he guesses we shouldn   t wait for him till this late hour  at least  he guesses that only mr. hindley would be up  and he   d rather avoid having the door opened by the master.
Wuthering Heights,nay  nay  he   s noan at gimmerton    said joseph.
Wuthering Heights,i   s niver wonder but he   s at t    bothom of a bog hoile.
Wuthering Heights,this visitation worn   t for nowt  and i wod hev    ye to look out  miss   yah muh be t    next.
Wuthering Heights,thank hivin for all  all warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen  and piked out fro    th    rubbidge  yah knaw whet t    scripture ses.
Wuthering Heights,and he began quoting several texts  referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them.
Wuthering Heights,i  having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things  left him preaching and her shivering  and betook myself to bed with little hareton  who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him.
Wuthering Heights,i heard joseph read on a while afterwards  then i distinguished his slow step on the ladder  and then i dropped asleep.
Wuthering Heights,coming down somewhat later than usual  i saw  by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters  miss catherine still seated near the fireplace.
Wuthering Heights,the house door was ajar  too  light entered from its unclosed windows  hindley had come out  and stood on the kitchen hearth  haggard and drowsy.
Wuthering Heights,what ails you  cathy    he was saying when i entered     you look as dismal as a drowned whelp.
Wuthering Heights,why are you so damp and pale  child        i   ve been wet    she answered reluctantly     and i   m cold  that   s all.
Wuthering Heights,oh  she is naughty    i cried  perceiving the master to be tolerably sober.
Wuthering Heights,she got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening  and there she has sat the night through  and i couldn   t prevail on her to stir.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw stared at us in surprise.
Wuthering Heights,the night through    he repeated.
Wuthering Heights,what kept her up  not fear of the thunder  surely  that was over hours since.
Wuthering Heights,neither of us wished to mention heathcliff   s absence  as long as we could conceal it  so i replied  i didn   t know how she took it into her head to sit up  and she said nothing.
Wuthering Heights,the morning was fresh and cool  i threw back the lattice  and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden  but catherine called peevishly to me     ellen  shut the window.
Wuthering Heights,i   m starving    and her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers.
Wuthering Heights,she   s ill    said hindley  taking her wrist     i suppose that   s the reason she would not go to bed.
Wuthering Heights,damn it  i don   t want to be troubled with more sickness here.
Wuthering Heights,what took you into the rain        running after t    lads  as usuald    croaked joseph  catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.
Wuthering Heights,if i war yah  maister  i   d just slam t    boards i    their faces all on    em  gentle and simple  never a day ut yah   re off  but yon cat o    linton comes sneaking hither  and miss nelly  shoo   s a fine lass  shoo sits watching for ye i    t    kitchen  and as yah   re in at one door  he   s out at t   other  and  then  wer grand lady goes a courting of her side  it   s bonny behaviour  lurking amang t    fields  after twelve o    t    night  wi    that fahl  flaysome divil of a gipsy  heathcliff  they think i   m blind  but i   m noan  nowt ut t    soart    i seed young linton boath coming and going  and i seed yah    directing his discourse to me      yah gooid fur nowt  slattenly witch  nip up and bolt into th    house  t    minute yah heard t    maister   s horse fit clatter up t    road.
Wuthering Heights,silence  eavesdropper    cried catherine     none of your insolence before me  edgar linton came yesterday by chance  hindley  and it was i who told him to be off  because i knew you would not like to have met him as you were.
Wuthering Heights,you lie  cathy  no doubt    answered her brother     and you are a confounded simpleton  but never mind linton at present  tell me  were you not with heathcliff last night  speak the truth  now.
Wuthering Heights,you need not be afraid of harming him  though i hate him as much as ever  he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck.
Wuthering Heights,to prevent it  i shall send him about his business this very morning  and after he   s gone  i   d advise you all to look sharp  i shall only have the more humour for you.
Wuthering Heights,i never saw heathcliff last night    answered catherine  beginning to sob bitterly     and if you do turn him out of doors  i   ll go with him.
Wuthering Heights,but  perhaps  you   ll never have an opportunity  perhaps  he   s gone.
Wuthering Heights,here she burst into uncontrollable grief  and the remainder of her words were inarticulate.
Wuthering Heights,hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse  and bade her get to her room immediately  or she shouldn   t cry for nothing  i obliged her to obey  and i shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber  it terrified me.
Wuthering Heights,i thought she was going mad  and i begged joseph to run for the doctor.
Wuthering Heights,it proved the commencement of delirium  mr. kenneth  as soon as he saw her  pronounced her dangerously ill  she had a fever.
Wuthering Heights,he bled her  and he told me to let her live on whey and water gruel  and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window  and then he left  for he had enough to do in the parish  where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.
Wuthering Heights,though i cannot say i made a gentle nurse  and joseph and the master were no better  and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be  she weathered it through.
Wuthering Heights,old mrs. linton paid us several visits  to be sure  and set things to rights  and scolded and ordered us all  and when catherine was convalescent  she insisted on conveying her to thrushcross grange  for which deliverance we were very grateful.
Wuthering Heights,but the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness  she and her husband both took the fever  and died within a few days of each other.
Wuthering Heights,our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate  and haughtier than ever.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder storm  and  one day  i had the misfortune  when she had provoked me exceedingly  to lay the blame of his disappearance on her  where indeed it belonged  as she well knew.
Wuthering Heights,from that period  for several months  she ceased to hold any communication with me  save in the relation of a mere servant.
Wuthering Heights,joseph fell under a ban also  he would speak his mind  and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl  and she esteemed herself a woman  and our mistress  and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.
Wuthering Heights,then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much  she ought to have her own way  and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her.
Wuthering Heights,from mr. earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof  and tutored by kenneth  and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages  her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand  and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.
Wuthering Heights,he was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices  not from affection  but from pride  he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the lintons  and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves  for aught he cared  edgar linton  as multitudes have been before and will be after him  was infatuated  and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to gimmerton chapel  three years subsequent to his father   s death.
Wuthering Heights,much against my inclination  i was persuaded to leave wuthering heights and accompany her here.
Wuthering Heights,little hareton was nearly five years old  and i had just begun to teach him his letters.
Wuthering Heights,we made a sad parting  but catherine   s tears were more powerful than ours.
Wuthering Heights,when i refused to go  and when she found her entreaties did not move me  she went lamenting to her husband and brother.
Wuthering Heights,the former offered me munificent wages  the latter ordered me to pack up  he wanted no women in the house  he said  now that there was no mistress  and as to hareton  the curate should take him in hand  by and by.
Wuthering Heights,and so i had but one choice left  to do as i was ordered.
Wuthering Heights,i told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster  i kissed hareton  said good by  and since then he has been a stranger  and it   s very queer to think it  but i   ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about ellen dean  and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him              at this point of the housekeeper   s story she chanced to glance towards the time piece over the chimney  and was in amazement on seeing the minute hand measure half past one.
Wuthering Heights,she would not hear of staying a second longer  in truth  i felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself.
Wuthering Heights,and now that she is vanished to her rest  and i have meditated for another hour or two  i shall summon courage to go also  in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.
Wuthering Heights,a charming introduction to a hermit   s life  four weeks    torture  tossing  and sickness  oh  these bleak winds and bitter northern skies  and impassable roads  and dilatory country surgeons  and oh  this dearth of the human physiognomy  and  worse than all  the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring   mr. heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.
Wuthering Heights,about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse   the last of the season.
Wuthering Heights,scoundrel  he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine  and that i had a great mind to tell him.
Wuthering Heights,but  alas  how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour  and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts  blisters and leeches  this is quite an easy interval.
Wuthering Heights,i am too weak to read  yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting.
Wuthering Heights,why not have up mrs. dean to finish her tale  i can recollect its chief incidents  as far as she had gone.
Wuthering Heights,yes  i remember her hero had run off  and never been heard of for three years  and the heroine was married.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll ring  she   ll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. dean came.
Wuthering Heights,it wants twenty minutes  sir  to taking the medicine    she commenced.
Wuthering Heights,away  away with it    i replied     i desire to have          the doctor says you must drop the powders.
Wuthering Heights,with all my heart  don   t interrupt me.
Wuthering Heights,come and take your seat here.
Wuthering Heights,keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.
Wuthering Heights,draw your knitting out of your pocket   that will do   now continue the history of mr. heathcliff  from where you left off  to the present day.
Wuthering Heights,did he finish his education on the continent  and come back a gentleman  or did he get a sizar   s place at college  or escape to america  and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster country  or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways        he may have done a little in all these vocations  mr. lockwood  but i couldn   t give my word for any.
Wuthering Heights,i stated before that i didn   t know how he gained his money  neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk  but  with your leave  i   ll proceed in my own fashion  if you think it will amuse and not weary you.
Wuthering Heights,are you feeling better this morning        much.
Wuthering Heights,that   s good news.
Wuthering Heights,i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange  and  to my agreeable disappointment  she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect.
Wuthering Heights,she seemed almost over fond of mr. linton  and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.
Wuthering Heights,they were both very attentive to her comfort  certainly.
Wuthering Heights,it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles  but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.
Wuthering Heights,there were no mutual concessions  one stood erect  and the others yielded  and who can be ill natured and bad tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference  i observed that mr. edgar had a deep rooted fear of ruffling her humour.
Wuthering Heights,he concealed it from her  but if ever he heard me answer sharply  or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers  he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account.
Wuthering Heights,he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness  and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.
Wuthering Heights,not to grieve a kind master  i learned to be less touchy  and  for the space of half a year  the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand  because no fire came near to explode it.
Wuthering Heights,catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then  they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband  who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution  produced by her perilous illness  as she was never subject to depression of spirits before.
Wuthering Heights,the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him.
Wuthering Heights,i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.
Wuthering Heights,it ended.
Wuthering Heights,well  we must be for ourselves in the long run  the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering  and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one   s interest was not the chief consideration in the other   s thoughts.
Wuthering Heights,on a mellow evening in september  i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering.
Wuthering Heights,it had got dusk  and the moon looked over the high wall of the court  causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.
Wuthering Heights,i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door  and lingered to rest  and drew in a few more breaths of the soft  sweet air  my eyes were on the moon  and my back to the entrance  when i heard a voice behind me say       nelly  is that you     it was a deep voice  and foreign in tone  yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.
Wuthering Heights,i turned about to discover who spoke  fearfully  for the doors were shut  and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps.
Wuthering Heights,something stirred in the porch  and  moving nearer  i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes  with dark face and hair.
Wuthering Heights,he leant against the side  and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.
Wuthering Heights,who can it be    i thought.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw  oh  no  the voice has no resemblance to his.
Wuthering Heights,i have waited here an hour    he resumed  while i continued staring     and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.
Wuthering Heights,i dared not enter.
Wuthering Heights,you do not know me  look  i   m not a stranger     a ray fell on his features  the cheeks were sallow  and half covered with black whiskers  the brows lowering  the eyes deep set and singular.
Wuthering Heights,i remembered the eyes.
Wuthering Heights,what    i cried  uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor  and i raised my hands in amazement.
Wuthering Heights,what  you come back  is it really you  is it        yes  heathcliff    he replied  glancing from me up to the windows  which reflected a score of glittering moons  but showed no lights from within.
Wuthering Heights,are they at home  where is she  nelly  you are not glad  you needn   t be so disturbed.
Wuthering Heights,is she here  speak  i want to have one word with her   your mistress.
Wuthering Heights,go  and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her.
Wuthering Heights,how will she take it    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,what will she do  the surprise bewilders me   it will put her out of her head  and you are heathcliff  but altered  nay  there   s no comprehending it.
Wuthering Heights,have you been for a soldier        go and carry my message    he interrupted  impatiently.
Wuthering Heights,i   m in hell till you do     he lifted the latch  and i entered  but when i got to the parlour where mr. and mrs. linton were  i could not persuade myself to proceed.
Wuthering Heights,at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted  and i opened the door.
Wuthering Heights,they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall  and displayed  beyond the garden trees  and the wild green park  the valley of gimmerton  with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top  for very soon after you pass the chapel  as you may have noticed  the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen .
Wuthering Heights,wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour  but our old house was invisible  it rather dips down on the other side.
Wuthering Heights,both the room and its occupants  and the scene they gazed on  looked wondrously peaceful.
Wuthering Heights,i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand  and was actually going away leaving it unsaid  after having put my question about the candles  when a sense of my folly compelled me to return  and mutter     a person from gimmerton wishes to see you ma   am.
Wuthering Heights,what does he want    asked mrs. linton.
Wuthering Heights,i did not question him    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,well  close the curtains  nelly    she said     and bring up tea.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll be back again directly.
Wuthering Heights,she quitted the apartment  mr. edgar inquired  carelessly  who it was.
Wuthering Heights,some one mistress does not expect    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,that heathcliff   you recollect him  sir   who used to live at mr. earnshaw   s.       what  the gipsy   the ploughboy    he cried.
Wuthering Heights,why did you not say so to catherine        hush  you must not call him by those names  master    i said.
Wuthering Heights,she   d be sadly grieved to hear you.
Wuthering Heights,she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.
Wuthering Heights,i guess his return will make a jubilee to her.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court.
Wuthering Heights,he unfastened it  and leant out.
Wuthering Heights,i suppose they were below  for he exclaimed quickly     don   t stand there  love  bring the person in  if it be anyone particular.
Wuthering Heights,ere long  i heard the click of the latch  and catherine flew upstairs  breathless and wild  too excited to show gladness  indeed  by her face  you would rather have surmised an awful calamity.
Wuthering Heights,oh  edgar  edgar    she panted  flinging her arms round his neck.
Wuthering Heights,oh  edgar darling  heathcliff   s come back   he is    and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze.
Wuthering Heights,well  well    cried her husband  crossly     don   t strangle me for that  he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.
Wuthering Heights,there is no need to be frantic        i know you didn   t like him    she answered  repressing a little the intensity of her delight.
Wuthering Heights,yet  for my sake  you must be friends now.
Wuthering Heights,shall i tell him to come up        here    he said     into the parlour        where else    she asked.
Wuthering Heights,he looked vexed  and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton eyed him with a droll expression   half angry  half laughing at his fastidiousness.
Wuthering Heights,no    she added  after a while     i cannot sit in the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,set two tables here  ellen  one for your master and miss isabella  being gentry  the other for heathcliff and myself  being of the lower orders.
Wuthering Heights,will that please you  dear  or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere  if so  give directions.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll run down and secure my guest.
Wuthering Heights,i   m afraid the joy is too great to be real     she was about to dart off again  but edgar arrested her.
Wuthering Heights,you bid him step up    he said  addressing me     and  catherine  try to be glad  without being absurd.
Wuthering Heights,the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.
Wuthering Heights,i descended  and found heathcliff waiting under the porch  evidently anticipating an invitation to enter.
Wuthering Heights,he followed my guidance without waste of words  and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress  whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.
Wuthering Heights,but the lady   s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door  she sprang forward  took both his hands  and led him to linton  and then she seized linton   s reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.
Wuthering Heights,now  fully revealed by the fire and candlelight  i was amazed  more than ever  to behold the transformation of heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,he had grown a tall  athletic  well formed man  beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth like.
Wuthering Heights,his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army.
Wuthering Heights,his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr. linton   s  it looked intelligent  and retained no marks of former degradation.
Wuthering Heights,a half civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire  but it was subdued  and his manner was even dignified  quite divested of roughness  though too stern for grace.
Wuthering Heights,my master   s surprise equalled or exceeded mine  he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy  as he had called him.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff dropped his slight hand  and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.
Wuthering Heights,sit down  sir    he said  at length.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton  recalling old times  would have me give you a cordial reception  and  of course  i am gratified when anything occurs to please her.
Wuthering Heights,and i also    answered heathcliff     especially if it be anything in which i have a part.
Wuthering Heights,i shall stay an hour or two willingly.
Wuthering Heights,he took a seat opposite catherine  who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.
Wuthering Heights,he did not raise his to her often  a quick glance now and then sufficed  but it flashed back  each time more confidently  the undisguised delight he drank from hers.
Wuthering Heights,they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.
Wuthering Heights,not so mr. edgar  he grew pale with pure annoyance  a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose  and stepping across the rug  seized heathcliff   s hands again  and laughed like one beside herself.
Wuthering Heights,i shall think it a dream to morrow    she cried.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not be able to believe that i have seen  and touched  and spoken to you once more.
Wuthering Heights,and yet  cruel heathcliff  you don   t deserve this welcome.
Wuthering Heights,to be absent and silent for three years  and never to think of me        a little more than you have thought of me    he murmured.
Wuthering Heights,i heard of your marriage  cathy  not long since  and  while waiting in the yard below  i meditated this plan   just to have one glimpse of your face  a stare of surprise  perhaps  and pretended pleasure  afterwards settle my score with hindley  and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself.
Wuthering Heights,your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind  but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time  nay  you   ll not drive me off again.
Wuthering Heights,you were really sorry for me  were you  well  there was cause.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice  and you must forgive me  for i struggled only for you        catherine  unless we are to have cold tea  please to come to the table    interrupted linton  striving to preserve his ordinary tone  and a due measure of politeness.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff will have a long walk  wherever he may lodge to night  and i   m thirsty.
Wuthering Heights,she took her post before the urn  and miss isabella came  summoned by the bell  then  having handed their chairs forward  i left the room.
Wuthering Heights,the meal hardly endured ten minutes.
Wuthering Heights,catherine   s cup was never filled  she could neither eat nor drink.
Wuthering Heights,edgar had made a slop in his saucer  and scarcely swallowed a mouthful.
Wuthering Heights,their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer.
Wuthering Heights,i asked  as he departed  if he went to gimmerton      no  to wuthering heights    he answered     mr. earnshaw invited me  when i called this morning.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw invited him  and he called on mr. earnshaw  i pondered this sentence painfully  after he was gone.
Wuthering Heights,is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite  and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak  i mused  i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away.
Wuthering Heights,about the middle of the night  i was wakened from my first nap by mrs. linton gliding into my chamber  taking a seat on my bedside  and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot rest  ellen    she said  by way of apology.
Wuthering Heights,and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness  edgar is sulky  because i   m glad of a thing that does not interest him  he refuses to open his mouth  except to utter pettish  silly speeches  and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy.
Wuthering Heights,he always contrives to be sick at the least cross  i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff  and he  either for a headache or a pang of envy  began to cry  so i got up and left him.
Wuthering Heights,what use is it praising heathcliff to him    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,as lads they had an aversion to each other  and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised  it   s human nature.
Wuthering Heights,let mr. linton alone about him  unless you would like an open quarrel between them.
Wuthering Heights,but does it not show great weakness    pursued she.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not envious  i never feel hurt at the brightness of isabella   s yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin  at her dainty elegance  and the fondness all the family exhibit for her.
Wuthering Heights,even you  nelly  if we have a dispute sometimes  you back isabella at once  and i yield like a foolish mother  i call her a darling  and flatter her into a good temper.
Wuthering Heights,it pleases her brother to see us cordial  and that pleases me.
Wuthering Heights,but they are very much alike  they are spoiled children  and fancy the world was made for their accommodation  and though i humour both  i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same.
Wuthering Heights,you   re mistaken  mrs. linton    said i.
Wuthering Heights,they humour you  i know what there would be to do if they did not.
Wuthering Heights,you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires.
Wuthering Heights,you may  however  fall out  at last  over something of equal consequence to both sides  and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.
Wuthering Heights,and then we shall fight to the death  sha   n   t we  nelly    she returned  laughing.
Wuthering Heights,no  i tell you  i have such faith in linton   s love  that i believe i might kill him  and he wouldn   t wish to retaliate.
Wuthering Heights,i advised her to value him the more for his affection.
Wuthering Heights,i do    she answered     but he needn   t resort to whining for trifles.
Wuthering Heights,it is childish  and  instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of anyone   s regard  and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend  he ought to have said it for me  and been delighted from sympathy.
Wuthering Heights,he must get accustomed to him  and he may as well like him  considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him  i   m sure he behaved excellently        what do you think of his going to wuthering heights    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,he is reformed in every respect  apparently  quite a christian  offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around        he explained it    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,i wonder as much as you.
Wuthering Heights,he said he called to gather information concerning me from you  supposing you resided there still  and joseph told hindley  who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing  and how he had been living  and finally  desired him to walk in.
Wuthering Heights,there were some persons sitting at cards  heathcliff joined them  my brother lost some money to him  and  finding him plentifully supplied  he requested that he would come again in the evening  to which he consented.
Wuthering Heights,hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently  he doesn   t trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.
Wuthering Heights,but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange  and an attachment to the house where we lived together  and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton.
Wuthering Heights,he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights  and doubtless my brother   s covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms  he was always greedy  though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in    said i.
Wuthering Heights,have you no fear of the consequences  mrs. linton        none for my friend    she replied     his strong head will keep him from danger  a little for hindley  but he can   t be made morally worse than he is  and i stand between him and bodily harm.
Wuthering Heights,the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity  i had risen in angry rebellion against providence.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   ve endured very  very bitter misery  nelly  if that creature knew how bitter  he   d be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance.
Wuthering Heights,it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone  had i expressed the agony i frequently felt  he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as i.
Wuthering Heights,however  it   s over  and i   ll take no revenge on his folly  i can afford to suffer anything hereafter  should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek  i   d not only turn the other  but i   d ask pardon for provoking it  and  as a proof  i   ll go make my peace with edgar instantly.
Wuthering Heights,good night  i   m an angel     in this self complacent conviction she departed  and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow  mr. linton had not only abjured his peevishness  though his spirits seemed still subdued by catherine   s exuberance of vivacity   but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon  and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days  both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff   mr. heathcliff i should say in future   used the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously  at first  he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  also  deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him  and he gradually established his right to be expected.
Wuthering Heights,he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable  and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.
Wuthering Heights,my master   s uneasiness experienced a lull  and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.
Wuthering Heights,his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest.
Wuthering Heights,she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen  infantile in manners  though possessed of keen wit  keen feelings  and a keen temper  too  if irritated.
Wuthering Heights,her brother  who loved her tenderly  was appalled at this fantastic preference.
Wuthering Heights,leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man  and the possible fact that his property  in default of heirs male  might pass into such a one   s power  he had sense to comprehend heathcliff   s disposition  to know that  though his exterior was altered  his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.
Wuthering Heights,and he dreaded that mind  it revolted him  he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to its keeping.
Wuthering Heights,he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited  and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment  for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on heathcliff   s deliberate designing.
Wuthering Heights,we had all remarked  during some time  that miss linton fretted and pined over something.
Wuthering Heights,she grew cross and wearisome  snapping at and teasing catherine continually  at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience.
Wuthering Heights,we excused her  to a certain extent  on the plea of ill health  she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.
Wuthering Heights,but one day  when she had been peculiarly wayward  rejecting her breakfast  complaining that the servants did not do what she told them  that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house  and edgar neglected her  that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open  and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her  with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations  mrs. linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed  and  having scolded her heartily  threatened to send for the doctor.
Wuthering Heights,mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim  instantly  that her health was perfect  and it was only catherine   s harshness which made her unhappy.
Wuthering Heights,how can you say i am harsh  you naughty fondling    cried the mistress  amazed at the unreasonable assertion.
Wuthering Heights,you are surely losing your reason.
Wuthering Heights,when have i been harsh  tell me        yesterday    sobbed isabella     and now        yesterday    said her sister in law.
Wuthering Heights,on what occasion        in our walk along the moor  you told me to ramble where i pleased  while you sauntered on with mr. heathcliff        and that   s your notion of harshness    said catherine  laughing.
Wuthering Heights,it was no hint that your company was superfluous  we didn   t care whether you kept with us or not  i merely thought heathcliff   s talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.
Wuthering Heights,oh  no    wept the young lady     you wished me away  because you knew i liked to be there        is she sane    asked mrs. linton  appealing to me.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll repeat our conversation  word for word  isabella  and you point out any charm it could have had for you.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t mind the conversation    she answered     i wanted to be with          well    said catherine  perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.
Wuthering Heights,with him  and i won   t be always sent off    she continued  kindling up.
Wuthering Heights,you are a dog in the manger  cathy  and desire no one to be loved but yourself        you are an impertinent little monkey    exclaimed mrs. linton  in surprise.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ll not believe this idiocy  it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of heathcliff   that you consider him an agreeable person  i hope i have misunderstood you  isabella        no  you have not    said the infatuated girl.
Wuthering Heights,i love him more than ever you loved edgar  and he might love me  if you would let him        i wouldn   t be you for a kingdom  then    catherine declared  emphatically  and she seemed to speak sincerely.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  help me to convince her of her madness.
Wuthering Heights,tell her what heathcliff is  an unreclaimed creature  without refinement  without cultivation  an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone.
Wuthering Heights,i   d as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter   s day  as recommend you to bestow your heart on him  it is deplorable ignorance of his character  child  and nothing else  which makes that dream enter your head.
Wuthering Heights,pray  don   t imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior  he   s not a rough diamond   a pearl containing oyster of a rustic  he   s a fierce  pitiless  wolfish man.
Wuthering Heights,i never say to him     let this or that enemy alone  because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them     i say     let them alone  because i should hate them to be wronged     and he   d crush you like a sparrow   s egg  isabella  if he found you a troublesome charge.
Wuthering Heights,i know he couldn   t love a linton  and yet he   d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations  avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.
Wuthering Heights,there   s my picture  and i   m his friend   so much so  that had he thought seriously to catch you  i should  perhaps  have held my tongue  and let you fall into his trap.
Wuthering Heights,miss linton regarded her sister in law with indignation.
Wuthering Heights,for shame  for shame    she repeated  angrily.
Wuthering Heights,you are worse than twenty foes  you poisonous friend        ah  you won   t believe me  then    said catherine.
Wuthering Heights,you think i speak from wicked selfishness        i   m certain you do    retorted isabella     and i shudder at you        good    cried the other.
Wuthering Heights,try for yourself  if that be your spirit  i have done  and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.
Wuthering Heights,and i must suffer for her egotism    she sobbed  as mrs. linton left the room.
Wuthering Heights,all  all is against me  she has blighted my single consolation.
Wuthering Heights,but she uttered falsehoods  didn   t she  mr. heathcliff is not a fiend  he has an honourable soul  and a true one  or how could he remember her        banish him from your thoughts  miss    i said.
Wuthering Heights,he   s a bird of bad omen  no mate for you.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton spoke strongly  and yet i can   t contradict her.
Wuthering Heights,she is better acquainted with his heart than i  or any one besides  and she never would represent him as worse than he is.
Wuthering Heights,honest people don   t hide their deeds.
Wuthering Heights,how has he been living  how has he got rich  why is he staying at wuthering heights  the house of a man whom he abhors  they say mr. earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.
Wuthering Heights,they sit up all night together continually  and hindley has been borrowing money on his land  and does nothing but play and drink  i heard only a week ago   it was joseph who told me   i met him at gimmerton     nelly     he said     we   s hae a crowner   s    quest enow  at ahr folks   .
Wuthering Heights,one on    em    s a   most getten his finger cut off wi    hauding t    other fro    stickin    hisseln loike a cawlf.
Wuthering Heights,that   s maister  yah knaw     at    s soa up o    going tuh t    grand    sizes.

Wuthering Heights,he can girn a laugh as well    s onybody at a raight divil   s jest.
Wuthering Heights,does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us  when he goes to t    grange  this is t    way on    t    up at sun down  dice  brandy  cloised shutters  und can   le light till next day at noon  then  t    fooil gangs banning un raving to his cham   er  makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i    thur lugs fur varry shame  un    the knave  why he can caint his brass  un    ate  un    sleep  un    off to his neighbour   s to gossip wi    t    wife.
Wuthering Heights,i    course  he tells dame catherine how her fathur   s goold runs into his pocket  and her fathur   s son gallops down t    broad road  while he flees afore to oppen t    pikes     now  miss linton  joseph is an old rascal  but no liar  and  if his account of heathcliff   s conduct be true  you would never think of desiring such a husband  would you        you are leagued with the rest  ellen    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not listen to your slanders.
Wuthering Heights,what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world     whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself  or persevered in nursing it perpetually  i cannot say  she had little time to reflect.
Wuthering Heights,the day after  there was a justice meeting at the next town  my master was obliged to attend  and mr. heathcliff  aware of his absence  called rather earlier than usual.
Wuthering Heights,catherine and isabella were sitting in the library  on hostile terms  but silent  the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion  and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion  the former  on mature consideration  really offended with her companion  and  if she laughed again at her pertness  inclined to make it no laughing matter to her.
Wuthering Heights,she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window.
Wuthering Heights,i was sweeping the hearth  and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.
Wuthering Heights,isabella  absorbed in her meditations  or a book  remained till the door opened  and it was too late to attempt an escape  which she would gladly have done had it been practicable.
Wuthering Heights,come in  that   s right    exclaimed the mistress  gaily  pulling a chair to the fire.
Wuthering Heights,here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them  and you are the very one we should both of us choose.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  i   m proud to show you  at last  somebody that dotes on you more than myself.
Wuthering Heights,i expect you to feel flattered.
Wuthering Heights,nay  it   s not nelly  don   t look at her  my poor little sister in law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.
Wuthering Heights,it lies in your own power to be edgar   s brother  no  no  isabella  you sha   n   t run off    she continued  arresting  with feigned playfulness  the confounded girl  who had risen indignantly.
Wuthering Heights,we were quarrelling like cats about you  heathcliff  and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration  and  moreover  i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside  my rival  as she will have herself to be  would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever  and send my image into eternal oblivion        catherine    said isabella  calling up her dignity  and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her     i   d thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me  even in joke  mr. heathcliff  be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me  she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances  and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.
Wuthering Heights,as the guest answered nothing  but took his seat  and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him  she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.
Wuthering Heights,by no means    cried mrs. linton in answer.
Wuthering Heights,i won   t be named a dog in the manger again.
Wuthering Heights,you shall stay  now then  heathcliff  why don   t you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news  isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.
Wuthering Heights,i   m sure she made some speech of the kind  did she not  ellen  and she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday   s walk  from sorrow and rage that i despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.
Wuthering Heights,i think you belie her    said heathcliff  twisting his chair to face them.
Wuthering Heights,she wishes to be out of my society now  at any rate     and he stared hard at the object of discourse  as one might do at a strange repulsive animal  a centipede from the indies  for instance  which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.
Wuthering Heights,the poor thing couldn   t bear that  she grew white and red in rapid succession  and  while tears beaded her lashes  bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine  and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down  and she could not remove the whole together  she began to make use of her nails  and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer   s with crescents of red.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a tigress    exclaimed mrs. linton  setting her free  and shaking her hand with pain.
Wuthering Heights,begone  for god   s sake  and hide your vixen face  how foolish to reveal those talons to him.
Wuthering Heights,can   t you fancy the conclusions he   ll draw  look  heathcliff  they are instruments that will do execution   you must beware of your eyes.
Wuthering Heights,i   d wrench them off her fingers  if they ever menaced me    he answered  brutally  when the door had closed after her.
Wuthering Heights,but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner  cathy  you were not speaking the truth  were you        i assure you i was    she returned.
Wuthering Heights,she has been dying for your sake several weeks  and raving about you this morning  and pouring forth a deluge of abuse  because i represented your failings in a plain light  for the purpose of mitigating her adoration.
Wuthering Heights,but don   t notice it further  i wished to punish her sauciness  that   s all.
Wuthering Heights,i like her too well  my dear heathcliff  to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.
Wuthering Heights,and i like her too ill to attempt it    said he     except in a very ghoulish fashion.
Wuthering Heights,you   d hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish  waxen face  the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow  and turning the blue eyes black  every day or two  they detestably resemble linton   s.       delectably    observed catherine.
Wuthering Heights,they are dove   s eyes   angel   s        she   s her brother   s heir  is she not    he asked  after a brief silence.
Wuthering Heights,i should be sorry to think so    returned his companion.
Wuthering Heights,half a dozen nephews shall erase her title  please heaven  abstract your mind from the subject at present  you are too prone to covet your neighbour   s goods  remember this neighbour   s goods are mine.
Wuthering Heights,if they were mine  they would be none the less that    said heathcliff     but though isabella linton may be silly  she is scarcely mad  and  in short  we   ll dismiss the matter  as you advise.
Wuthering Heights,from their tongues they did dismiss it  and catherine  probably  from her thoughts.
Wuthering Heights,the other  i felt certain  recalled it often in the course of the evening.
Wuthering Heights,i saw him smile to himself   grin rather   and lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs. linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment.
Wuthering Heights,i determined to watch his movements.
Wuthering Heights,my heart invariably cleaved to the master   s  in preference to catherine   s side  with reason i imagined  for he was kind  and trustful  and honourable  and she   she could not be called the opposite  yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude  that i had little faith in her principles  and still less sympathy for her feelings.
Wuthering Heights,i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr. heathcliff  quietly  leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.
Wuthering Heights,his visits were a continual nightmare to me  and  i suspected  to my master also.
Wuthering Heights,his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining.
Wuthering Heights,i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings  and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold  waiting his time to spring and destroy.
Wuthering Heights,sometimes  while meditating on these things in solitude  i   ve got up in a sudden terror  and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways  and then i   ve recollected his confirmed bad habits  and  hopeless of benefiting him  have flinched from re entering the dismal house  doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word.
Wuthering Heights,one time i passed the old gate  going out of my way  on a journey to gimmerton.
Wuthering Heights,it was about the period that my narrative has reached  a bright frosty afternoon  the ground bare  and the road hard and dry.
Wuthering Heights,i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand  a rough sand pillar  with the letters w. h. cut on its north side  on the east  g.  and on the south west  t. g. it serves as a guide post to the grange  the heights  and village.
Wuthering Heights,the sun shone yellow on its grey head  reminding me of summer  and i cannot say why  but all at once a gush of child   s sensations flowed into my heart.
Wuthering Heights,hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty years before.
Wuthering Heights,i gazed long at the weather worn block  and  stooping down  perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail shells and pebbles  which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things  and  as fresh as reality  it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf  his dark  square head bent forward  and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.
Wuthering Heights,poor hindley    i exclaimed  involuntarily.
Wuthering Heights,i started  my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine  it vanished in a twinkling  but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights.
Wuthering Heights,superstition urged me to comply with this impulse  supposing he should be dead  i thought   or should die soon    supposing it were a sign of death  the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew  and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb.
Wuthering Heights,the apparition had outstripped me  it stood looking through the gate.
Wuthering Heights,that was my first idea on observing an elf locked  brown eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars.
Wuthering Heights,further reflection suggested this must be hareton  my hareton  not altered greatly since i left him  ten months since.
Wuthering Heights,god bless thee  darling    i cried  forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  it   s nelly  nelly  thy nurse.
Wuthering Heights,he retreated out of arm   s length  and picked up a large flint.
Wuthering Heights,i am come to see thy father  hareton    i added  guessing from the action that nelly  if she lived in his memory at all  was not recognised as one with me.
Wuthering Heights,he raised his missile to hurl it  i commenced a soothing speech  but could not stay his hand  the stone struck my bonnet  and then ensued  from the stammering lips of the little fellow  a string of curses  which  whether he comprehended them or not  were delivered with practised emphasis  and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity.
Wuthering Heights,you may be certain this grieved more than angered me.
Wuthering Heights,fit to cry  i took an orange from my pocket  and offered it to propitiate him.
Wuthering Heights,he hesitated  and then snatched it from my hold  as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him.
Wuthering Heights,i showed another  keeping it out of his reach.
Wuthering Heights,who has taught you those fine words  my bairn    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,the curate        damn the curate  and thee  gie me that    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,tell us where you got your lessons  and you shall have it    said i.
Wuthering Heights,who   s your master        devil daddy    was his answer.
Wuthering Heights,and what do you learn from daddy    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,he jumped at the fruit  i raised it higher.
Wuthering Heights,what does he teach you    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,naught    said he     but to keep out of his gait.
Wuthering Heights,daddy cannot bide me  because i swear at him.
Wuthering Heights,ah  and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy    i observed.
Wuthering Heights,ay   nay    he drawled.
Wuthering Heights,who  then        heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i asked if he liked mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,ay    he answered again.
Wuthering Heights,desiring to have his reasons for liking him  i could only gather the sentences      i known   t  he pays dad back what he gies to me   he curses daddy for cursing me.
Wuthering Heights,he says i mun do as i will.
Wuthering Heights,and the curate does not teach you to read and write  then    i pursued.
Wuthering Heights,no  i was told the curate should have his        teeth dashed down his        throat  if he stepped over the threshold   heathcliff had promised that     i put the orange in his hand  and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly dean was waiting to speak with him  by the garden gate.
Wuthering Heights,he went up the walk  and entered the house  but  instead of hindley  heathcliff appeared on the door stones  and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race  making no halt till i gained the guide post  and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin.
Wuthering Heights,this is not much connected with miss isabella   s affair  except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard  and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange  even though i should wake a domestic storm  by thwarting mrs. linton   s pleasure.
Wuthering Heights,the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court.
Wuthering Heights,she had never spoken a word to her sister in law for three days  but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining  and we found it a great comfort.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss linton  i knew.
Wuthering Heights,now  as soon as he beheld her  his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front.
Wuthering Heights,i was standing by the kitchen window  but i drew out of sight.
Wuthering Heights,he then stepped across the pavement to her  and said something  she seemed embarrassed  and desirous of getting away  to prevent it  he laid his hand on her arm.
Wuthering Heights,she averted her face  he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer.
Wuthering Heights,there was another rapid glance at the house  and supposing himself unseen  the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.
Wuthering Heights,judas  traitor    i ejaculated.
Wuthering Heights,you are a hypocrite  too  are you  a deliberate deceiver.
Wuthering Heights,who is  nelly    said catherine   s voice at my elbow  i had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.
Wuthering Heights,your worthless friend    i answered  warmly     the sneaking rascal yonder.
Wuthering Heights,ah  he has caught a glimpse of us   he is coming in  i wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss  when he told you he hated her     mrs. linton saw isabella tear herself free  and run into the garden  and a minute after  heathcliff opened the door.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t withhold giving some loose to my indignation  but catherine angrily insisted on silence  and threatened to order me out of the kitchen  if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.
Wuthering Heights,to hear you  people might think you were the mistress    she cried.
Wuthering Heights,you want setting down in your right place  heathcliff  what are you about  raising this stir  i said you must let isabella alone    i beg you will  unless you are tired of being received here  and wish linton to draw the bolts against you        god forbid that he should try    answered the black villain.
Wuthering Heights,i detested him just then.
Wuthering Heights,god keep him meek and patient  every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven        hush    said catherine  shutting the inner door.
Wuthering Heights,don   t vex me.
Wuthering Heights,why have you disregarded my request  did she come across you on purpose        what is it to you    he growled.
Wuthering Heights,i have a right to kiss her  if she chooses  and you have no right to object.
Wuthering Heights,i am not your husband  you needn   t be jealous of me        i   m not jealous of you    replied the mistress     i   m jealous for you.
Wuthering Heights,clear your face  you sha   n   t scowl at me  if you like isabella  you shall marry her.
Wuthering Heights,but do you like her  tell the truth  heathcliff  there  you won   t answer.
Wuthering Heights,i   m certain you don   t.       and would mr. linton approve of his sister marrying that man    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton should approve    returned my lady  decisively.
Wuthering Heights,he might spare himself the trouble    said heathcliff     i could do as well without his approbation.
Wuthering Heights,and as to you  catherine  i have a mind to speak a few words now  while we are at it.
Wuthering Heights,i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me infernally   infernally  do you hear  and if you flatter yourself that i don   t perceive it  you are a fool  and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words  you are an idiot  and if you fancy i   ll suffer unrevenged  i   ll convince you of the contrary  in a very little while  meantime  thank you for telling me your sister in law   s secret  i swear i   ll make the most of it.
Wuthering Heights,and stand you aside        what new phase of his character is this    exclaimed mrs. linton  in amazement.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve treated you infernally   and you   ll take your revenge  how will you take it  ungrateful brute  how have i treated you infernally        i seek no revenge on you    replied heathcliff  less vehemently.
Wuthering Heights,that   s not the plan.
Wuthering Heights,the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don   t turn against him  they crush those beneath them.
Wuthering Heights,you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement  only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style  and refrain from insult as much as you are able.
Wuthering Heights,having levelled my palace  don   t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home.
Wuthering Heights,if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel  i   d cut my throat        oh  the evil is that i am not jealous  is it    cried catherine.
Wuthering Heights,well  i won   t repeat my offer of a wife  it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul.
Wuthering Heights,your bliss lies  like his  in inflicting misery.
Wuthering Heights,you prove it.
Wuthering Heights,edgar is restored from the ill temper he gave way to at your coming  i begin to be secure and tranquil  and you  restless to know us at peace  appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.
Wuthering Heights,quarrel with edgar  if you please  heathcliff  and deceive his sister  you   ll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.
Wuthering Heights,the conversation ceased.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton sat down by the fire  flushed and gloomy.
Wuthering Heights,the spirit which served her was growing intractable  she could neither lay nor control it.
Wuthering Heights,he stood on the hearth with folded arms  brooding on his evil thoughts  and in this position i left them to seek the master  who was wondering what kept catherine below so long.
Wuthering Heights,ellen    said he  when i entered     have you seen your mistress        yes  she   s in the kitchen  sir    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,she   s sadly put out by mr. heathcliff   s behaviour  and  indeed  i do think it   s time to arrange his visits on another footing.
Wuthering Heights,there   s harm in being too soft  and now it   s come to this   .
Wuthering Heights,and i related the scene in the court  and  as near as i dared  the whole subsequent dispute.
Wuthering Heights,i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs. linton  unless she made it so afterwards  by assuming the defensive for her guest.
Wuthering Heights,edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close.
Wuthering Heights,his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.
Wuthering Heights,this is insufferable    he exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend  and force his company on me  call me two men out of the hall  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian   i have humoured her enough.
Wuthering Heights,he descended  and bidding the servants wait in the passage  went  followed by me  to the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion  mrs. linton  at least  was scolding with renewed vigour  heathcliff had moved to the window  and hung his head  somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently.
Wuthering Heights,he saw the master first  and made a hasty motion that she should be silent  which she obeyed  abruptly  on discovering the reason of his intimation.
Wuthering Heights,how is this    said linton  addressing her     what notion of propriety must you have to remain here  after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard  i suppose  because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it  you are habituated to his baseness  and  perhaps  imagine i can get used to it too        have you been listening at the door  edgar    asked the mistress  in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband  implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  who had raised his eyes at the former speech  gave a sneering laugh at the latter  on purpose  it seemed  to draw mr. linton   s attention to him.
Wuthering Heights,he succeeded  but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve been so far forbearing with you  sir    he said quietly     not that i was ignorant of your miserable  degraded character  but i felt you were only partly responsible for that  and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance  i acquiesced   foolishly.
Wuthering Heights,your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous  for that cause  and to prevent worse consequences  i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house  and give notice now that i require your instant departure.
Wuthering Heights,three minutes    delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision.
Wuthering Heights,cathy  this lamb of yours threatens like a bull    he said.
Wuthering Heights,it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.
Wuthering Heights,by god  mr. linton  i   m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down     my master glanced towards the passage  and signed me to fetch the men  he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.
Wuthering Heights,i obeyed the hint  but mrs. linton  suspecting something  followed  and when i attempted to call them  she pulled me back  slammed the door to  and locked it.
Wuthering Heights,fair means    she said  in answer to her husband   s look of angry surprise.
Wuthering Heights,if you have not courage to attack him  make an apology  or allow yourself to be beaten.
Wuthering Heights,it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess.
Wuthering Heights,no  i   ll swallow the key before you shall get it  i   m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each  after constant indulgence of one   s weak nature  and the other   s bad one  i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude  stupid to absurdity  edgar  i was defending you and yours  and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick  for daring to think an evil thought of me     it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master.
Wuthering Heights,he tried to wrest the key from catherine   s grasp  and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire  whereupon mr. edgar was taken with a nervous trembling  and his countenance grew deadly pale.
Wuthering Heights,for his life he could not avert that excess of emotion  mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.
Wuthering Heights,he leant on the back of a chair  and covered his face.
Wuthering Heights,oh  heavens  in old days this would win you knighthood    exclaimed mrs. linton.
Wuthering Heights,we are vanquished  we are vanquished  heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice.
Wuthering Heights,cheer up  you sha   n   t be hurt  your type is not a lamb  it   s a sucking leveret.
Wuthering Heights,i wish you joy of the milk blooded coward  cathy    said her friend.
Wuthering Heights,i compliment you on your taste.
Wuthering Heights,and that is the slavering  shivering thing you preferred to me  i would not strike him with my fist  but i   d kick him with my foot  and experience considerable satisfaction.
Wuthering Heights,is he weeping  or is he going to faint for fear     the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push.
Wuthering Heights,he   d better have kept his distance  my master quickly sprang erect  and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man.
Wuthering Heights,it took his breath for a minute  and while he choked  mr. linton walked out by the back door into the yard  and from thence to the front entrance.
Wuthering Heights,there  you   ve done with coming here    cried catherine.
Wuthering Heights,get away  now  he   ll return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants.
Wuthering Heights,if he did overhear us  of course he   d never forgive you.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve played me an ill turn  heathcliff  but go   make haste  i   d rather see edgar at bay than you.
Wuthering Heights,do you suppose i   m going with that blow burning in my gullet    he thundered.
Wuthering Heights,by hell  no  i   ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold  if i don   t floor him now  i shall murder him some time  so  as you value his existence  let me get at him        he is not coming    i interposed  framing a bit of a lie.
Wuthering Heights,there   s the coachman and the two gardeners  you   ll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them  each has a bludgeon  and master will  very likely  be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders.
Wuthering Heights,the gardeners and coachman were there  but linton was with them.
Wuthering Heights,they had already entered the court.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  on the second thoughts  resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings  he seized the poker  smashed the lock from the inner door  and made his escape as they tramped in.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton  who was very much excited  bade me accompany her upstairs.
Wuthering Heights,she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance  and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance.
Wuthering Heights,i   m nearly distracted  nelly    she exclaimed  throwing herself on the sofa.
Wuthering Heights,a thousand smiths    hammers are beating in my head  tell isabella to shun me  this uproar is owing to her  and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present  i shall get wild.
Wuthering Heights,and  nelly  say to edgar  if you see him again to night  that i   m in danger of being seriously ill.
Wuthering Heights,i wish it may prove true.
Wuthering Heights,he has startled and distressed me shockingly  i want to frighten him.
Wuthering Heights,besides  he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings  i   m certain i should recriminate  and god knows where we should end  will you do so  my good nelly  you are aware that i am no way blamable in this matter.
Wuthering Heights,what possessed him to turn listener  heathcliff   s talk was outrageous  after you left us  but i could soon have diverted him from isabella  and the rest meant nothing.
Wuthering Heights,now all is dashed wrong  by the fool   s craving to hear evil of self  that haunts some people like a demon  had edgar never gathered our conversation  he would never have been the worse for it.
Wuthering Heights,really  when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him  i did not care hardly what they did to each other  especially as i felt that  however the scene closed  we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long  well  if i cannot keep heathcliff for my friend   if edgar will be mean and jealous  i   ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.
Wuthering Heights,that will be a prompt way of finishing all  when i am pushed to extremity  but it   s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope  i   d not take linton by surprise with it.
Wuthering Heights,to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me  you must represent the peril of quitting that policy  and remind him of my passionate temper  verging  when kindled  on frenzy.
Wuthering Heights,i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance  and look rather more anxious about me.
Wuthering Heights,the stolidity with which i received these instructions was  no doubt  rather exasperating  for they were delivered in perfect sincerity  but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account  beforehand  might  by exerting her will  manage to control herself tolerably  even while under their influence  and i did not wish to    frighten   her husband  as she said  and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness.
Wuthering Heights,therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour  but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.
Wuthering Heights,he began to speak first.
Wuthering Heights,remain where you are  catherine    he said  without any anger in his voice  but with much sorrowful despondency.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not stay.
Wuthering Heights,i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled  but i wish just to learn whether  after this evening   s events  you intend to continue your intimacy with          oh  for mercy   s sake    interrupted the mistress  stamping her foot     for mercy   s sake  let us hear no more of it now  your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever  your veins are full of ice water  but mine are boiling  and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.
Wuthering Heights,to get rid of me  answer my question    persevered mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,you must answer it  and that violence does not alarm me.
Wuthering Heights,i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone  when you please.
Wuthering Heights,will you give up heathcliff hereafter  or will you give up me  it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time  and i absolutely require to know which you choose.
Wuthering Heights,i require to be let alone    exclaimed catherine  furiously.
Wuthering Heights,i demand it  don   t you see i can scarcely stand  edgar  you   you leave me     she rang the bell till it broke with a twang  i entered leisurely.
Wuthering Heights,it was enough to try the temper of a saint  such senseless  wicked rages  there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa  and grinding her teeth  so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters  mr. linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.
Wuthering Heights,he told me to fetch some water.
Wuthering Heights,she had no breath for speaking.
Wuthering Heights,i brought a glass full  and as she would not drink  i sprinkled it on her face.
Wuthering Heights,in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff  and turned up her eyes  while her cheeks  at once blanched and livid  assumed the aspect of death.
Wuthering Heights,linton looked terrified.
Wuthering Heights,there is nothing in the world the matter    i whispered.
Wuthering Heights,i did not want him to yield  though i could not help being afraid in my heart.
Wuthering Heights,she has blood on her lips    he said  shuddering.
Wuthering Heights,never mind    i answered  tartly.
Wuthering Heights,and i told him how she had resolved  previous to his coming  on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.
Wuthering Heights,i incautiously gave the account aloud  and she heard me  for she started up   her hair flying over her shoulders  her eyes flashing  the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally.
Wuthering Heights,i made up my mind for broken bones  at least  but she only glared about her for an instant  and then rushed from the room.
Wuthering Heights,the master directed me to follow  i did  to her chamber door  she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.
Wuthering Heights,as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning  i went to ask whether she would have some carried up.
Wuthering Heights,no    she replied  peremptorily.
Wuthering Heights,the same question was repeated at dinner and tea  and again on the morrow after  and received the same answer.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton  on his part  spent his time in the library  and did not inquire concerning his wife   s occupations.
Wuthering Heights,isabella and he had had an hour   s interview  during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for heathcliff   s advances  but he could make nothing of her evasive replies  and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily  adding  however  a solemn warning  that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor  it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.
Wuthering Heights,while miss linton moped about the park and garden  always silent  and almost always in tears  and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened   wearying  i guessed  with a continual vague expectation that catherine  repenting her conduct  would come of her own accord to ask pardon  and seek a reconciliation   and she fasted pertinaciously  under the idea  probably  that at every meal edgar was ready to choke for her absence  and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet  i went about my household duties  convinced that the grange had but one sensible soul in its walls  and that lodged in my body.
Wuthering Heights,i wasted no condolences on miss  nor any expostulations on my mistress  nor did i pay much attention to the sighs of my master  who yearned to hear his lady   s name  since he might not hear her voice.
Wuthering Heights,i determined they should come about as they pleased for me  and though it was a tiresomely slow process  i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress  as i thought at first.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton  on the third day  unbarred her door  and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter  desired a renewed supply  and a basin of gruel  for she believed she was dying.
Wuthering Heights,that i set down as a speech meant for edgar   s ears  i believed no such thing  so i kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast.
Wuthering Heights,she ate and drank eagerly  and sank back on her pillow again  clenching her hands and groaning.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i will die    she exclaimed     since no one cares anything about me.
Wuthering Heights,i wish i had not taken that.
Wuthering Heights,then a good while after i heard her murmur     no  i   ll not die   he   d be glad   he does not love me at all   he would never miss me        did you want anything  ma   am    i inquired  still preserving my external composure  in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange  exaggerated manner.
Wuthering Heights,what is that apathetic being doing    she demanded  pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face.
Wuthering Heights,has he fallen into a lethargy  or is he dead        neither    replied i     if you mean mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,he   s tolerably well  i think  though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought  he is continually among his books  since he has no other society.
Wuthering Heights,i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition  but i could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.
Wuthering Heights,among his books    she cried  confounded.
Wuthering Heights,and i dying  i on the brink of the grave  my god  does he know how i   m altered    continued she  staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.
Wuthering Heights,is that catherine linton  he imagines me in a pet   in play  perhaps.
Wuthering Heights,cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest  nelly  if it be not too late  as soon as i learn how he feels  i   ll choose between these two  either to starve at once   that would be no punishment unless he had a heart   or to recover  and leave the country.
Wuthering Heights,are you speaking the truth about him now  take care.
Wuthering Heights,is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life        why  ma   am    i answered     the master has no idea of your being deranged  and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.
Wuthering Heights,you think not  cannot you tell him i will    she returned.
Wuthering Heights,persuade him  speak of your own mind  say you are certain i will        no  you forget  mrs. linton    i suggested     that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening  and to morrow you will perceive its good effects.
Wuthering Heights,if i were only sure it would kill him    she interrupted     i   d kill myself directly  these three awful nights i   ve never closed my lids   and oh  i   ve been tormented  i   ve been haunted  nelly  but i begin to fancy you don   t like me.
Wuthering Heights,how strange  i thought  though everybody hated and despised each other  they could not avoid loving me.
Wuthering Heights,and they have all turned to enemies in a few hours.
Wuthering Heights,they have  i   m positive  the people here.
Wuthering Heights,how dreary to meet death  surrounded by their cold faces  isabella  terrified and repelled  afraid to enter the room  it would be so dreadful to watch catherine go.
Wuthering Heights,and edgar standing solemnly by to see it over  then offering prayers of thanks to god for restoring peace to his house  and going back to his books  what in the name of all that feels has he to do with books  when i am dying     she could not bear the notion which i had put into her head of mr. linton   s philosophical resignation.
Wuthering Heights,tossing about  she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness  and tore the pillow with her teeth  then raising herself up all burning  desired that i would open the window.
Wuthering Heights,we were in the middle of winter  the wind blew strong from the north east  and i objected.
Wuthering Heights,both the expressions flitting over her face  and the changes of her moods  began to alarm me terribly  and brought to my recollection her former illness  and the doctor   s injunction that she should not be crossed.
Wuthering Heights,a minute previously she was violent  now  supported on one arm  and not noticing my refusal to obey her  she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made  and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species  her mind had strayed to other associations.
Wuthering Heights,that   s a turkey   s    she murmured to herself     and this is a wild duck   s  and this is a pigeon   s. ah  they put pigeons    feathers in the pillows   no wonder i couldn   t die  let me take care to throw it on the floor when i lie down.
Wuthering Heights,and here is a moor cock   s  and this   i should know it among a thousand   it   s a lapwing   s. bonny bird  wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.
Wuthering Heights,it wanted to get to its nest  for the clouds had touched the swells  and it felt rain coming.
Wuthering Heights,this feather was picked up from the heath  the bird was not shot  we saw its nest in the winter  full of little skeletons.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff set a trap over it  and the old ones dared not come.
Wuthering Heights,i made him promise he   d never shoot a lapwing after that  and he didn   t. yes  here are more  did he shoot my lapwings  nelly  are they red  any of them  let me look.
Wuthering Heights,give over with that baby work    i interrupted  dragging the pillow away  and turning the holes towards the mattress  for she was removing its contents by handfuls.
Wuthering Heights,lie down and shut your eyes  you   re wandering.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a mess  the down is flying about like snow.
Wuthering Heights,i went here and there collecting it.
Wuthering Heights,i see in you  nelly    she continued dreamily     an aged woman  you have grey hair and bent shoulders.
Wuthering Heights,this bed is the fairy cave under penistone crags  and you are gathering elf bolts to hurt our heifers  pretending  while i am near  that they are only locks of wool.
Wuthering Heights,that   s what you   ll come to fifty years hence  i know you are not so now.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not wandering  you   re mistaken  or else i should believe you really were that withered hag  and i should think i was under penistone crags  and i   m conscious it   s night  and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet.
Wuthering Heights,the black press  where is that    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,you are talking in your sleep        it   s against the wall  as it always is    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,it does appear odd   i see a face in it        there   s no press in the room  and never was    said i  resuming my seat  and looping up the curtain that i might watch her.
Wuthering Heights,don   t you see that face    she inquired  gazing earnestly at the mirror.
Wuthering Heights,and say what i could  i was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own  so i rose and covered it with a shawl.
Wuthering Heights,it   s behind there still    she pursued  anxiously.
Wuthering Heights,and it stirred.
Wuthering Heights,who is it  i hope it will not come out when you are gone  oh  nelly  the room is haunted  i   m afraid of being alone     i took her hand in mine  and bid her be composed  for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame  and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass.
Wuthering Heights,there   s nobody here    i insisted.
Wuthering Heights,it was yourself  mrs. linton  you knew it a while since.
Wuthering Heights,myself    she gasped     and the clock is striking twelve  it   s true  then  that   s dreadful     her fingers clutched the clothes  and gathered them over her eyes.
Wuthering Heights,i attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband  but i was summoned back by a piercing shriek   the shawl had dropped from the frame.
Wuthering Heights,why  what is the matter    cried i.
Wuthering Heights,who is coward now  wake up  that is the glass   the mirror  mrs. linton  and you see yourself in it  and there am i too by your side.
Wuthering Heights,trembling and bewildered  she held me fast  but the horror gradually passed from her countenance  its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.
Wuthering Heights,oh  dear  i thought i was at home    she sighed.
Wuthering Heights,i thought i was lying in my chamber at wuthering heights.
Wuthering Heights,because i   m weak  my brain got confused  and i screamed unconsciously.
Wuthering Heights,don   t say anything  but stay with me.
Wuthering Heights,i dread sleeping  my dreams appal me.
Wuthering Heights,a sound sleep would do you good  ma   am    i answered     and i hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.
Wuthering Heights,oh  if i were but in my own bed in the old house    she went on bitterly  wringing her hands.
Wuthering Heights,and that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.
Wuthering Heights,do let me feel it   it comes straight down the moor   do let me have one breath     to pacify her i held the casement ajar a few seconds.
Wuthering Heights,a cold blast rushed through  i closed it  and returned to my post.
Wuthering Heights,she lay still now  her face bathed in tears.
Wuthering Heights,exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit  our fiery catherine was no better than a wailing child.
Wuthering Heights,how long is it since i shut myself in here    she asked  suddenly reviving.
Wuthering Heights,it was monday evening    i replied     and this is thursday night  or rather friday morning  at present.
Wuthering Heights,what  of the same week    she exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,only that brief time        long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill temper    observed i.
Wuthering Heights,well  it seems a weary number of hours    she muttered doubtfully     it must be more.
Wuthering Heights,i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled  and edgar being cruelly provoking  and me running into this room desperate.
Wuthering Heights,as soon as ever i had barred the door  utter blackness overwhelmed me  and i fell on the floor.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t explain to edgar how certain i felt of having a fit  or going raging mad  if he persisted in teasing me  i had no command of tongue  or brain  and he did not guess my agony  perhaps  it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice.
Wuthering Heights,before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear  it began to be dawn  and  nelly  i   ll tell you what i thought  and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason.
Wuthering Heights,i thought as i lay there  with my head against that table leg  and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window  that i was enclosed in the oak panelled bed at home  and my heart ached with some great grief which  just waking  i could not recollect.
Wuthering Heights,i pondered  and worried myself to discover what it could be  and  most strangely  the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank  i did not recall that they had been at all.
Wuthering Heights,i was a child  my father was just buried  and my misery arose from the separation that hindley had ordered between me and heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i was laid alone  for the first time  and  rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping  i lifted my hand to push the panels aside  it struck the table top  i swept it along the carpet  and then memory burst in  my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched  it must have been temporary derangement  for there is scarcely cause.
Wuthering Heights,but  supposing at twelve years old i had been wrenched from the heights  and every early association  and my all in all  as heathcliff was at that time  and been converted at a stroke into mrs. linton  the lady of thrushcross grange  and the wife of a stranger  an exile  and outcast  thenceforth  from what had been my world.
Wuthering Heights,you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled  shake your head as you will  nelly  you have helped to unsettle me  you should have spoken to edgar  indeed you should  and compelled him to leave me quiet  oh  i   m burning  i wish i were out of doors  i wish i were a girl again  half savage and hardy  and free  and laughing at injuries  not maddening under them  why am i so changed  why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words  i   m sure i should be myself were i once among the heather on those hills.
Wuthering Heights,open the window again wide  fasten it open  quick  why don   t you move        because i won   t give you your death of cold    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,you won   t give me a chance of life  you mean    she said sullenly.
Wuthering Heights,however  i   m not helpless yet  i   ll open it myself.
Wuthering Heights,and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her  she crossed the room  walking very uncertainly  threw it back  and bent out  careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.
Wuthering Heights,i entreated  and finally attempted to force her to retire.
Wuthering Heights,but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine  she was delirious  i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings .
Wuthering Heights,there was no moon  and everything beneath lay in misty darkness  not a light gleamed from any house  far or near  all had been extinguished long ago  and those at wuthering heights were never visible   still she asserted she caught their shining.
Wuthering Heights,look    she cried eagerly     that   s my room with the candle in it  and the trees swaying before it  and the other candle is in joseph   s garret.
Wuthering Heights,joseph sits up late  doesn   t he  he   s waiting till i come home that he may lock the gate.
Wuthering Heights,well  he   ll wait a while yet.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a rough journey  and a sad heart to travel it  and we must pass by gimmerton kirk to go that journey  we   ve braved its ghosts often together  and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.
Wuthering Heights,but  heathcliff  if i dare you now  will you venture  if you do  i   ll keep you.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not lie there by myself  they may bury me twelve feet deep  and throw the church down over me  but i won   t rest till you are with me.
Wuthering Heights,i never will     she paused  and resumed with a strange smile.
Wuthering Heights,he   s considering   he   d rather i   d come to him  find a way  then  not through that kirkyard.
Wuthering Heights,you are slow  be content  you always followed me     perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity  i was planning how i could reach something to wrap about her  without quitting my hold of herself  for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice   when  to my consternation  i heard the rattle of the door handle  and mr. linton entered.
Wuthering Heights,he had only then come from the library  and  in passing through the lobby  had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity  or fear  to examine what it signified  at that late hour.
Wuthering Heights,oh  sir    i cried  checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him  and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.
Wuthering Heights,my poor mistress is ill  and she quite masters me  i cannot manage her at all  pray  come and persuade her to go to bed.
Wuthering Heights,forget your anger  for she   s hard to guide any way but her own.
Wuthering Heights,catherine ill    he said  hastening to us.
Wuthering Heights,shut the window  ellen  catherine  why       he was silent.
Wuthering Heights,the haggardness of mrs. linton   s appearance smote him speechless  and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment.
Wuthering Heights,she   s been fretting here    i continued     and eating scarcely anything  and never complaining  she would admit none of us till this evening  and so we couldn   t inform you of her state  as we were not aware of it ourselves  but it is nothing.
Wuthering Heights,i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly  the master frowned.
Wuthering Heights,it is nothing  is it  ellen dean    he said sternly.
Wuthering Heights,you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this    and he took his wife in his arms  and looked at her with anguish.
Wuthering Heights,at first she gave him no glance of recognition  he was invisible to her abstracted gaze.
Wuthering Heights,the delirium was not fixed  however  having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness  by degrees she centred her attention on him  and discovered who it was that held her.
Wuthering Heights,ah  you are come  are you  edgar linton    she said  with angry animation.
Wuthering Heights,you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted  and when you are wanted  never  i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now   i see we shall   but they can   t keep me from my narrow home out yonder  my resting place  where i   m bound before spring is over  there it is  not among the lintons  mind  under the chapel roof  but in the open air  with a head stone  and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me        catherine  what have you done    commenced the master.
Wuthering Heights,am i nothing to you any more  do you love that wretch heath          hush    cried mrs. linton.
Wuthering Heights,hush  this moment  you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window  what you touch at present you may have  but my soul will be on that hill top before you lay hands on me again.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t want you  edgar  i   m past wanting you.
Wuthering Heights,return to your books.
Wuthering Heights,i   m glad you possess a consolation  for all you had in me is gone.
Wuthering Heights,her mind wanders  sir    i interposed.
Wuthering Heights,she has been talking nonsense the whole evening  but let her have quiet  and proper attendance  and she   ll rally.
Wuthering Heights,hereafter  we must be cautious how we vex her.
Wuthering Heights,i desire no further advice from you    answered mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,you knew your mistress   s nature  and you encouraged me to harass her.
Wuthering Heights,and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days  it was heartless  months of sickness could not cause such a change     i began to defend myself  thinking it too bad to be blamed for another   s wicked waywardness.
Wuthering Heights,i knew mrs. linton   s nature to be headstrong and domineering    cried i     but i didn   t know that you wished to foster her fierce temper  i didn   t know that  to humour her  i should wink at mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you  and i have got a faithful servant   s wages  well  it will teach me to be careful next time.
Wuthering Heights,next time you may gather intelligence for yourself        the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service  ellen dean    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,you   d rather hear nothing about it  i suppose  then  mr. linton    said i.    heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to miss  and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers  on purpose to poison the mistress against you     confused as catherine was  her wits were alert at applying our conversation.
Wuthering Heights,ah  nelly has played traitor    she exclaimed  passionately.
Wuthering Heights,nelly is my hidden enemy.
Wuthering Heights,you witch  so you do seek elf bolts to hurt us  let me go  and i   ll make her rue  i   ll make her howl a recantation     a maniac   s fury kindled under her brows  she struggled desperately to disengage herself from linton   s arms.
Wuthering Heights,i felt no inclination to tarry the event  and  resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility  i quitted the chamber.
Wuthering Heights,in passing the garden to reach the road  at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall  i saw something white moved irregularly  evidently by another agent than the wind.
Wuthering Heights,notwithstanding my hurry  i stayed to examine it  lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.
Wuthering Heights,my surprise and perplexity were great on discovering  by touch more than vision  miss isabella   s springer  fanny  suspended by a handkerchief  and nearly at its last gasp.
Wuthering Heights,i quickly released the animal  and lifted it into the garden.
Wuthering Heights,i had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed  and wondered much how it could have got out there  and what mischievous person had treated it so.
Wuthering Heights,while untying the knot round the hook  it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses    feet galloping at some distance  but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought  though it was a strange sound  in that place  at two o   clock in the morning.
Wuthering Heights,mr. kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street  and my account of catherine linton   s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.
Wuthering Heights,he was a plain rough man  and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack  unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before.
Wuthering Heights,nelly dean    said he     i can   t help fancying there   s an extra cause for this.
Wuthering Heights,what has there been to do at the grange  we   ve odd reports up here.
Wuthering Heights,a stout  hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a trifle  and that sort of people should not either.
Wuthering Heights,it   s hard work bringing them through fevers  and such things.
Wuthering Heights,how did it begin        the master will inform you    i answered     but you are acquainted with the earnshaws    violent dispositions  and mrs. linton caps them all.
Wuthering Heights,i may say this  it commenced in a quarrel.
Wuthering Heights,she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit.
Wuthering Heights,that   s her account  at least  for she flew off in the height of it  and locked herself up.
Wuthering Heights,afterwards  she refused to eat  and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream  knowing those about her  but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton will be sorry    observed kenneth  interrogatively.
Wuthering Heights,sorry  he   ll break his heart should anything happen    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,don   t alarm him more than necessary.
Wuthering Heights,well  i told him to beware    said my companion     and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning  hasn   t he been intimate with mr. heathcliff lately        heathcliff frequently visits at the grange    answered i     though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy  than because the master likes his company.
Wuthering Heights,at present he   s discharged from the trouble of calling  owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss linton which he manifested.
Wuthering Heights,i hardly think he   ll be taken in again.
Wuthering Heights,and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him    was the doctor   s next question.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not in her confidence    returned i  reluctant to continue the subject.
Wuthering Heights,no  she   s a sly one    he remarked  shaking his head.
Wuthering Heights,she keeps her own counsel  but she   s a real little fool.
Wuthering Heights,i have it from good authority that last night  and a pretty night it was   she and heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours  and he pressed her not to go in again  but just mount his horse and away with him  my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that  when it was to be he didn   t hear  but you urge mr. linton to look sharp     this news filled me with fresh fears  i outstripped kenneth  and ran most of the way back.
Wuthering Heights,the little dog was yelping in the garden yet.
Wuthering Heights,i spared a minute to open the gate for it  but instead of going to the house door  it coursed up and down snuffing the grass  and would have escaped to the road  had i not seized it and conveyed it in with me.
Wuthering Heights,on ascending to isabella   s room  my suspicions were confirmed  it was empty.
Wuthering Heights,had i been a few hours sooner mrs. linton   s illness might have arrested her rash step.
Wuthering Heights,but what could be done now  there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly.
Wuthering Heights,i could not pursue them  however  and i dared not rouse the family  and fill the place with confusion  still less unfold the business to my master  absorbed as he was in his present calamity  and having no heart to spare for a second grief  i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue  and suffer matters to take their course  and kenneth being arrived  i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him.
Wuthering Heights,catherine lay in a troubled sleep  her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy  he now hung over her pillow  watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features.
Wuthering Heights,the doctor  on examining the case for himself  spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination  if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.
Wuthering Heights,to me  he signified the threatening danger was not so much death  as permanent alienation of intellect.
Wuthering Heights,i did not close my eyes that night  nor did mr. linton  indeed  we never went to bed  and the servants were all up long before the usual hour  moving through the house with stealthy tread  and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations.
Wuthering Heights,every one was active but miss isabella  and they began to remark how sound she slept  her brother  too  asked if she had risen  and seemed impatient for her presence  and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister in law.
Wuthering Heights,i trembled lest he should send me to call her  but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight.
Wuthering Heights,one of the maids  a thoughtless girl  who had been on an early errand to gimmerton  came panting upstairs  open mouthed  and dashed into the chamber  crying     oh  dear  dear  what mun we have next  master  master  our young lady          hold your noise    cried i hastily  enraged at her clamorous manner.
Wuthering Heights,speak lower  mary   what is the matter    said mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,what ails your young lady        she   s gone  she   s gone  yon    heathcliff   s run off wi    her    gasped the girl.
Wuthering Heights,that is not true    exclaimed linton  rising in agitation.
Wuthering Heights,it cannot be  how has the idea entered your head  ellen dean  go and seek her.
Wuthering Heights,it is incredible  it cannot be.
Wuthering Heights,as he spoke he took the servant to the door  and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.
Wuthering Heights,why  i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here    she stammered     and he asked whether we weren   t in trouble at the grange.
Wuthering Heights,i thought he meant for missis   s sickness  so i answered  yes.
Wuthering Heights,then says he     there   s somebody gone after    em  i guess     i stared.
Wuthering Heights,he saw i knew nought about it  and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse   s shoe fastened at a blacksmith   s shop  two miles out of gimmerton  not very long after midnight  and how the blacksmith   s lass had got up to spy who they were  she knew them both directly.
Wuthering Heights,and she noticed the man   heathcliff it was  she felt certain  nob   dy could mistake him  besides   put a sovereign in her father   s hand for payment.
Wuthering Heights,the lady had a cloak about her face  but having desired a sup of water  while she drank it fell back  and she saw her very plain.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on  and they set their faces from the village  and went as fast as the rough roads would let them.
Wuthering Heights,the lass said nothing to her father  but she told it all over gimmerton this morning.
Wuthering Heights,i ran and peeped  for form   s sake  into isabella   s room  confirming  when i returned  the servant   s statement.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton had resumed his seat by the bed  on my re entrance  he raised his eyes  read the meaning of my blank aspect  and dropped them without giving an order  or uttering a word.
Wuthering Heights,are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,how should we do        she went of her own accord    answered the master     she had a right to go if she pleased.
Wuthering Heights,trouble me no more about her.
Wuthering Heights,hereafter she is only my sister in name  not because i disown her  but because she has disowned me.
Wuthering Heights,and that was all he said on the subject  he did not make a single inquiry further  or mention her in any way  except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home  wherever it was  when i knew it.
Wuthering Heights,for two months the fugitives remained absent  in those two months  mrs. linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever.
Wuthering Heights,no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her.
Wuthering Heights,day and night he was watching  and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict  and  though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety   in fact  that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity   he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when catherine   s life was declared out of danger  and hour after hour he would sit beside her  tracing the gradual return to bodily health  and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also  and she would soon be entirely her former self.
Wuthering Heights,the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton had put on her pillow  in the morning  a handful of golden crocuses  her eye  long stranger to any gleam of pleasure  caught them in waking  and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.
Wuthering Heights,these are the earliest flowers at the heights    she exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,they remind me of soft thaw winds  and warm sunshine  and nearly melted snow.
Wuthering Heights,edgar  is there not a south wind  and is not the snow almost gone        the snow is quite gone down here  darling    replied her husband     and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors  the sky is blue  and the larks are singing  and the becks and brooks are all brim full.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  last spring at this time  i was longing to have you under this roof  now  i wish you were a mile or two up those hills  the air blows so sweetly  i feel that it would cure you.
Wuthering Heights,i shall never be there but once more    said the invalid     and then you   ll leave me  and i shall remain for ever.
Wuthering Heights,next spring you   ll long again to have me under this roof  and you   ll look back and think you were happy to day.
Wuthering Heights,linton lavished on her the kindest caresses  and tried to cheer her by the fondest words  but  vaguely regarding the flowers  she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.
Wuthering Heights,we knew she was really better  and  therefore  decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency  and it might be partially removed by a change of scene.
Wuthering Heights,the master told me to light a fire in the many weeks    deserted parlour  and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window  and then he brought her down  and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat  and  as we expected  revived by the objects round her  which  though familiar  were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber.
Wuthering Heights,by evening she seemed greatly exhausted  yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment  and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed  till another room could be prepared.
Wuthering Heights,to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs  we fitted up this  where you lie at present   on the same floor with the parlour  and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other  leaning on edgar   s arm.
Wuthering Heights,ah  i thought myself  she might recover  so waited on as she was.
Wuthering Heights,and there was double cause to desire it  for on her existence depended that of another  we cherished the hope that in a little while mr. linton   s heart would be gladdened  and his lands secured from a stranger   s gripe  by the birth of an heir.
Wuthering Heights,i should mention that isabella sent to her brother  some six weeks from her departure  a short note  announcing her marriage with heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,it appeared dry and cold  but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology  and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation  if her proceeding had offended him  asserting that she could not help it then  and being done  she had now no power to repeal it.
Wuthering Heights,linton did not reply to this  i believe  and  in a fortnight more  i got a long letter  which i considered odd  coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll read it  for i keep it yet.
Wuthering Heights,any relic of the dead is precious  if they were valued living.
Wuthering Heights,dear ellen  it begins    i came last night to wuthering heights  and heard  for the first time  that catherine has been  and is yet  very ill.
Wuthering Heights,i must not write to her  i suppose  and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him.
Wuthering Heights,still  i must write to somebody  and the only choice left me is you.
Wuthering Heights,inform edgar that i   d give the world to see his face again   that my heart returned to thrushcross grange in twenty four hours after i left it  and is there at this moment  full of warm feelings for him  and catherine  i can   t follow it though    these words are underlined    they need not expect me  and they may draw what conclusions they please  taking care  however  to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection.
Wuthering Heights,the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.
Wuthering Heights,i want to ask you two questions  the first is    how did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here  i cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.
Wuthering Heights,the second question i have great interest in  it is this   is mr. heathcliff a man  if so  is he mad  and if not  is he a devil  i sha   n   t tell my reasons for making this inquiry  but i beseech you to explain  if you can  what i have married  that is  when you call to see me  and you must call  ellen  very soon.
Wuthering Heights,don   t write  but come  and bring me something from edgar.
Wuthering Heights,now  you shall hear how i have been received in my new home  as i am led to imagine the heights will be.
Wuthering Heights,it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts  they never occupy my thoughts  except at the moment when i miss them.
Wuthering Heights,i should laugh and dance for joy  if i found their absence was the total of my miseries  and the rest was an unnatural dream   the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors  by that  i judged it to be six o   clock  and my companion halted half an hour  to inspect the park  and the gardens  and  probably  the place itself  as well as he could  so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse  and your old fellow servant  joseph  issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle.
Wuthering Heights,he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit.
Wuthering Heights,his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face  squint malignantly  project his under lip  and turn away.
Wuthering Heights,then he took the two horses  and led them into the stables  reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate  as if we lived in an ancient castle.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff stayed to speak to him  and i entered the kitchen   a dingy  untidy hole  i daresay you would not know it  it is so changed since it was in your charge.
Wuthering Heights,by the fire stood a ruffianly child  strong in limb and dirty in garb  with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.
Wuthering Heights,this is edgar   s legal nephew    i reflected      mine in a manner  i must shake hands  and   yes   i must kiss him.
Wuthering Heights,it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning.
Wuthering Heights,i approached  and  attempting to take his chubby fist  said      how do you do  my dear     he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend.
Wuthering Heights,shall you and i be friends  hareton    was my next essay at conversation.
Wuthering Heights,an oath  and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not    frame off   rewarded my perseverance.
Wuthering Heights,hey  throttler  lad    whispered the little wretch  rousing a half bred bull dog from its lair in a corner.
Wuthering Heights,now  wilt thou be ganging    he asked authoritatively.
Wuthering Heights,love for my life urged a compliance  i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff was nowhere visible  and joseph  whom i followed to the stables  and requested to accompany me in  after staring and muttering to himself  screwed up his nose and replied      mim  mim  mim  did iver christian body hear aught like it  mincing un    munching  how can i tell whet ye say        i say  i wish you to come with me into the house    i cried  thinking him deaf  yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.
Wuthering Heights,none o    me  i getten summut else to do    he answered  and continued his work  moving his lantern jaws meanwhile  and surveying my dress and countenance  the former a great deal too fine  but the latter  i   m sure  as sad as he could desire  with sovereign contempt.
Wuthering Heights,i walked round the yard  and through a wicket  to another door  at which i took the liberty of knocking  in hopes some more civil servant might show himself.
Wuthering Heights,after a short suspense  it was opened by a tall  gaunt man  without neckerchief  and otherwise extremely slovenly  his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders  and his eyes  too  were like a ghostly catherine   s with all their beauty annihilated.
Wuthering Heights,what   s your business here    he demanded  grimly.
Wuthering Heights,who are you        my name was isabella linton    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve seen me before  sir.
Wuthering Heights,i   m lately married to mr. heathcliff  and he has brought me here   i suppose by your permission.
Wuthering Heights,is he come back  then    asked the hermit  glaring like a hungry wolf.
Wuthering Heights,yes   we came just now    i said     but he left me by the kitchen door  and when i would have gone in  your little boy played sentinel over the place  and frightened me off by the help of a bull dog.
Wuthering Heights,it   s well the hellish villain has kept his word    growled my future host  searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff  and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations  and threats of what he would have done had the    fiend   deceived him.
Wuthering Heights,i repented having tried this second entrance  and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing  but ere i could execute that intention  he ordered me in  and shut and re fastened the door.
Wuthering Heights,there was a great fire  and that was all the light in the huge apartment  whose floor had grown a uniform grey  and the once brilliant pewter dishes  which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl  partook of a similar obscurity  created by tarnish and dust.
Wuthering Heights,i inquired whether i might call the maid  and be conducted to a bedroom  mr. earnshaw vouchsafed no answer.
Wuthering Heights,he walked up and down  with his hands in his pockets  apparently quite forgetting my presence  and his abstraction was evidently so deep  and his whole aspect so misanthropical  that i shrank from disturbing him again.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll not be surprised  ellen  at my feeling particularly cheerless  seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth  and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home  containing the only people i loved on earth  and there might as well be the atlantic to part us  instead of those four miles  i could not overpass them  i questioned with myself   where must i turn for comfort  and   mind you don   t tell edgar  or catherine   above every sorrow beside  this rose pre eminent  despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff  i had sought shelter at wuthering heights  almost gladly  because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him  but he knew the people we were coming amongst  and he did not fear their intermeddling.
Wuthering Heights,i sat and thought a doleful time  the clock struck eight  and nine  and still my companion paced to and fro  his head bent on his breast  and perfectly silent  unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.
Wuthering Heights,i listened to detect a woman   s voice in the house  and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations  which  at last  spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.
Wuthering Heights,i was not aware how openly i grieved  till earnshaw halted opposite  in his measured walk  and gave me a stare of newly awakened surprise.
Wuthering Heights,taking advantage of his recovered attention  i exclaimed      i   m tired with my journey  and i want to go to bed  where is the maid servant  direct me to her  as she won   t come to me        we have none    he answered     you must wait on yourself        where must i sleep  then    i sobbed  i was beyond regarding self respect  weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.
Wuthering Heights,joseph will show you heathcliff   s chamber    said he     open that door   he   s in there.
Wuthering Heights,i was going to obey  but he suddenly arrested me  and added in the strangest tone      be so good as to turn your lock  and draw your bolt   don   t omit it        well    i said.
Wuthering Heights,but why  mr. earnshaw    i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,look here    he replied  pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol  having a double edged spring knife attached to the barrel.
Wuthering Heights,that   s a great tempter to a desperate man  is it not  i cannot resist going up with this every night  and trying his door.
Wuthering Heights,if once i find it open he   s done for  i do it invariably  even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain  it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him.
Wuthering Heights,you fight against that devil for love as long as you may  when the time comes  not all the angels in heaven shall save him     i surveyed the weapon inquisitively.
Wuthering Heights,a hideous notion struck me  how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument  i took it from his hand  and touched the blade.
Wuthering Heights,he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second  it was not horror  it was covetousness.
Wuthering Heights,he snatched the pistol back  jealously  shut the knife  and returned it to its concealment.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t care if you tell him    said he.
Wuthering Heights,put him on his guard  and watch for him.
Wuthering Heights,you know the terms we are on  i see  his danger does not shock you.
Wuthering Heights,what has heathcliff done to you    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,in what has he wronged you  to warrant this appalling hatred  wouldn   t it be wiser to bid him quit the house        no    thundered earnshaw     should he offer to leave me  he   s a dead man  persuade him to attempt it  and you are a murderess  am i to lose all  without a chance of retrieval  is hareton to be a beggar  oh  damnation  i will have it back  and i   ll have his gold too  and then his blood  and hell shall have his soul  it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before     you   ve acquainted me  ellen  with your old master   s habits.
Wuthering Heights,he is clearly on the verge of madness  he was so last night at least.
Wuthering Heights,i shuddered to be near him  and thought on the servant   s ill bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable.
Wuthering Heights,he now recommenced his moody walk  and i raised the latch  and escaped into the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,joseph was bending over the fire  peering into a large pan that swung above it  and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.
Wuthering Heights,the contents of the pan began to boil  and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl  i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper  and  being hungry  i resolved it should be eatable  so  crying out sharply     i   ll make the porridge    i removed the vessel out of his reach  and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw    i continued     directs me to wait on myself  i will.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not going to act the lady among you  for fear i should starve.
Wuthering Heights,gooid lord    he muttered  sitting down  and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle.
Wuthering Heights,if there   s to be fresh ortherings   just when i getten used to two maisters  if i mun hev    a mistress set o   er my heead  it   s like time to be flitting.
Wuthering Heights,i niver did think to see t    day that i mud lave th    owld place   but i doubt it   s nigh at hand     this lamentation drew no notice from me  i went briskly to work  sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun  but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance.
Wuthering Heights,it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition  the quicker the thible ran round  and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water.
Wuthering Heights,joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation.
Wuthering Heights,thear    he ejaculated.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  thou willn   t sup thy porridge to neeght  they   ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.
Wuthering Heights,thear  agean  i   d fling in bowl un    all  if i wer ye  there  pale t    guilp off  un    then ye   ll hae done wi   t. bang  bang.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a mercy t    bothom isn   t deaved out     it was rather a rough mess  i own  when poured into the basins  four had been provided  and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy  which hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip.
Wuthering Heights,i expostulated  and desired that he should have his in a mug  affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.
Wuthering Heights,the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety  assuring me  repeatedly  that    the barn was every bit as good   as i     and every bit as wollsome    and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited.
Wuthering Heights,meanwhile  the infant ruffian continued sucking  and glowered up at me defyingly  as he slavered into the jug.
Wuthering Heights,i shall have my supper in another room    i said.
Wuthering Heights,have you no place you call a parlour        parlour    he echoed  sneeringly     parlour  nay  we   ve noa parlours.
Wuthering Heights,if yah dunnut loike wer company  there   s maister   s  un    if yah dunnut loike maister  there   s us.
Wuthering Heights,then i shall go upstairs    i answered     show me a chamber.
Wuthering Heights,i put my basin on a tray  and went myself to fetch some more milk.
Wuthering Heights,with great grumblings  the fellow rose  and preceded me in my ascent  we mounted to the garrets  he opened a door  now and then  to look into the apartments we passed.
Wuthering Heights,here   s a rahm    he said  at last  flinging back a cranky board on hinges.
Wuthering Heights,it   s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a pack o    corn i    t    corner  thear  meeterly clane  if ye   re feared o    muckying yer grand silk cloes  spread yer hankerchir o    t    top on   t.    the    rahm   was a kind of lumber hole smelling strong of malt and grain  various sacks of which articles were piled around  leaving a wide  bare space in the middle.
Wuthering Heights,why  man    i exclaimed  facing him angrily     this is not a place to sleep in.
Wuthering Heights,i wish to see my bed room.
Wuthering Heights,bed rume    he repeated  in a tone of mockery.
Wuthering Heights,yah   s see all t    bed rumes thear is   yon   s mine.
Wuthering Heights,he pointed into the second garret  only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls  and having a large  low  curtainless bed  with an indigo coloured quilt  at one end.
Wuthering Heights,what do i want with yours    i retorted.
Wuthering Heights,i suppose mr. heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house  does he        oh  it   s maister hathecliff   s ye   re wanting    cried he  as if making a new discovery.
Wuthering Heights,couldn   t ye ha    said soa  at onst  un    then  i mud ha    telled ye  baht all this wark  that that   s just one ye cannut see   he allas keeps it locked  un    nob   dy iver mells on   t but hisseln.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve a nice house  joseph    i could not refrain from observing     and pleasant inmates  and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs  however  that is not to the present purpose   there are other rooms.
Wuthering Heights,for heaven   s sake be quick  and let me settle somewhere     he made no reply to this adjuration  only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps  and halting before an apartment which  from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture  i conjectured to be the best one.
Wuthering Heights,there was a carpet   a good one  but the pattern was obliterated by dust  a fireplace hung with cut paper  dropping to pieces  a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make  but they had evidently experienced rough usage  the vallances hung in festoons  wrenched from their rings  and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side  causing the drapery to trail upon the floor.
Wuthering Heights,the chairs were also damaged  many of them severely  and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.
Wuthering Heights,i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession  when my fool of a guide announced       this here is t    maister   s.   my supper by this time was cold  my appetite gone  and my patience exhausted.
Wuthering Heights,i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge  and means of repose.
Wuthering Heights,whear the divil    began the religious elder.
Wuthering Heights,the lord bless us  the lord forgie us  whear the hell wold ye gang  ye marred  wearisome nowt  ye   ve seen all but hareton   s bit of a cham   er.
Wuthering Heights,there   s not another hoile to lig down in i    th    hahse     i was so vexed  i flung my tray and its contents on the ground  and then seated myself at the stairs    head  hid my face in my hands  and cried.
Wuthering Heights,ech  ech    exclaimed joseph.
Wuthering Heights,weel done  miss cathy  weel done  miss cathy  howsiver  t    maister sall just tum   le o   er them brocken pots  un    then we   s hear summut  we   s hear how it   s to be.
Wuthering Heights,gooid for naught madling  ye desarve pining fro    this to churstmas  flinging t    precious gifts uh god under fooit i    yer flaysome rages  but i   m mista   en if ye shew yer sperrit lang.
Wuthering Heights,will hathecliff bide sich bonny ways  think ye  i nobbut wish he may catch ye i    that plisky.
Wuthering Heights,i nobbut wish he may.
Wuthering Heights,and so he went on scolding to his den beneath  taking the candle with him  and i remained in the dark.
Wuthering Heights,the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath  and bestirring myself to remove its effects.
Wuthering Heights,an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler  whom i now recognised as a son of our old skulker  it had spent its whelphood at the grange  and was given by my father to mr. hindley.
Wuthering Heights,i fancy it knew me  it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute  and then hastened to devour the porridge  while i groped from step to step  collecting the shattered earthenware  and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket handkerchief.
Wuthering Heights,our labours were scarcely over when i heard earnshaw   s tread in the passage  my assistant tucked in his tail  and pressed to the wall  i stole into the nearest doorway.
Wuthering Heights,the dog   s endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful  as i guessed by a scutter downstairs  and a prolonged  piteous yelping.
Wuthering Heights,i had better luck  he passed on  entered his chamber  and shut the door.
Wuthering Heights,directly after joseph came up with hareton  to put him to bed.
Wuthering Heights,i had found shelter in hareton   s room  and the old man  on seeing me  said       they   s rahm for boath ye un    yer pride  now  i sud think i    the hahse.
Wuthering Heights,it   s empty  ye may hev    it all to yerseln  un    him as allas maks a third  i    sich ill company     gladly did i take advantage of this intimation  and the minute i flung myself into a chair  by the fire  i nodded  and slept.
Wuthering Heights,my slumber was deep and sweet  though over far too soon.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff awoke me  he had just come in  and demanded  in his loving manner  what i was doing there  i told him the cause of my staying up so late   that he had the key of our room in his pocket.
Wuthering Heights,the adjective our gave mortal offence.
Wuthering Heights,he swore it was not  nor ever should be  mine  and he   d   but i   ll not repeat his language  nor describe his habitual conduct  he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence  i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear  yet  i assure you  a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens.
Wuthering Heights,he told me of catherine   s illness  and accused my brother of causing it  promising that i should be edgar   s proxy in suffering  till he could get hold of him.
Wuthering Heights,i do hate him   i am wretched   i have been a fool  beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the grange.
Wuthering Heights,i shall expect you every day   don   t disappoint me    isabella.
Wuthering Heights,as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master  and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights  and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs. linton   s situation  and her ardent desire to see him  with a wish that he would transmit to her  as early as possible  some token of forgiveness by me.
Wuthering Heights,forgiveness    said linton.
Wuthering Heights,i have nothing to forgive her  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon  if you like  and say that i am not angry  but i   m sorry to have lost her  especially as i can never think she   ll be happy.
Wuthering Heights,it is out of the question my going to see her  however  we are eternally divided  and should she really wish to oblige me  let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.
Wuthering Heights,and you won   t write her a little note  sir    i asked  imploringly.
Wuthering Heights,no    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,it is needless.
Wuthering Heights,my communication with heathcliff   s family shall be as sparing as his with mine.
Wuthering Heights,it shall not exist     mr. edgar   s coldness depressed me exceedingly  and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said  when i repeated it  and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella.
Wuthering Heights,i daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning  i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway  and i nodded to her  but she drew back  as if afraid of being observed.
Wuthering Heights,i entered without knocking.
Wuthering Heights,there never was such a dreary  dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented  i must confess  that if i had been in the young lady   s place  i would  at least  have swept the hearth  and wiped the tables with a duster.
Wuthering Heights,but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.
Wuthering Heights,her pretty face was wan and listless  her hair uncurled  some locks hanging lankly down  and some carelessly twisted round her head.
Wuthering Heights,probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening.
Wuthering Heights,hindley was not there.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff sat at a table  turning over some papers in his pocket book  but he rose when i appeared  asked me how i did  quite friendly  and offered me a chair.
Wuthering Heights,he was the only thing there that seemed decent  and i thought he never looked better.
Wuthering Heights,so much had circumstances altered their positions  that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman  and his wife as a thorough little slattern  she came forward eagerly to greet me  and held out one hand to take the expected letter.
Wuthering Heights,i shook my head.
Wuthering Heights,she wouldn   t understand the hint  but followed me to a sideboard  where i went to lay my bonnet  and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff guessed the meaning of her man  uvres  and said      if you have got anything for isabella  as no doubt you have  nelly   give it to her.
Wuthering Heights,you needn   t make a secret of it  we have no secrets between us.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i have nothing    i replied  thinking it best to speak the truth at once.
Wuthering Heights,my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present.
Wuthering Heights,he sends his love  ma   am  and his wishes for your happiness  and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned  but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication  as nothing could come of keeping it up.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff   s lip quivered slightly  and she returned to her seat in the window.
Wuthering Heights,her husband took his stand on the hearthstone  near me  and began to put questions concerning catherine.
Wuthering Heights,i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness  and he extorted from me  by cross examination  most of the facts connected with its origin.
Wuthering Heights,i blamed her  as she deserved  for bringing it all on herself  and ended by hoping that he would follow mr. linton   s example and avoid future interference with his family  for good or evil.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton is now just recovering    i said     she   ll never be like she was  but her life is spared  and if you really have a regard for her  you   ll shun crossing her way again  nay  you   ll move out of this country entirely  and that you may not regret it  i   ll inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw  as that young lady is different from me.
Wuthering Heights,her appearance is changed greatly  her character much more so  and the person who is compelled  of necessity  to be her companion  will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was  by common humanity  and a sense of duty        that is quite possible    remarked heathcliff  forcing himself to seem calm     quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.
Wuthering Heights,but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity  and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his  before you leave this house  i must exact a promise from you that you   ll get me an interview with her  consent  or refuse  i will see her  what do you say        i say  mr. heathcliff    i replied     you must not  you never shall  through my means.
Wuthering Heights,another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether.
Wuthering Heights,with your aid that may be avoided    he continued     and should there be danger of such an event   should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence   why  i think i shall be justified in going to extremes  i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine would suffer greatly from his loss  the fear that she would restrains me.
Wuthering Heights,and there you see the distinction between our feelings  had he been in my place  and i in his  though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall  i never would have raised a hand against him.
Wuthering Heights,you may look incredulous  if you please  i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his.
Wuthering Heights,the moment her regard ceased  i would have torn his heart out  and drunk his blood  but  till then   if you don   t believe me  you don   t know me   till then  i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head        and yet    i interrupted     you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration  by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now  when she has nearly forgotten you  and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress.
Wuthering Heights,you suppose she has nearly forgotten me    he said.
Wuthering Heights,oh  nelly  you know she has not  you know as well as i do  that for every thought she spends on linton she spends a thousand on me  at a most miserable period of my life  i had a notion of the kind  it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer  but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again.
Wuthering Heights,and then  linton would be nothing  nor hindley  nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt.
Wuthering Heights,two words would comprehend my future   death and hell  existence  after losing her  would be hell.
Wuthering Heights,yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar linton   s attachment more than mine.
Wuthering Heights,if he loved with all the powers of his puny being  he couldn   t love as much in eighty years as i could in a day.
Wuthering Heights,and catherine has a heart as deep as i have  the sea could be as readily contained in that horse trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him.
Wuthering Heights,tush  he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog  or her horse.
Wuthering Heights,it is not in him to be loved like me  how can she love in him what he has not        catherine and edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be    cried isabella  with sudden vivacity.
Wuthering Heights,no one has a right to talk in that manner  and i won   t hear my brother depreciated in silence        your brother is wondrous fond of you too  isn   t he    observed heathcliff  scornfully.
Wuthering Heights,he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.
Wuthering Heights,he is not aware of what i suffer    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t tell him that.
Wuthering Heights,you have been telling him something  then  you have written  have you        to say that i was married  i did write   you saw the note.
Wuthering Heights,and nothing since        no.
Wuthering Heights,my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition    i remarked.
Wuthering Heights,somebody   s love comes short in her case  obviously  whose  i may guess  but  perhaps  i shouldn   t say.
Wuthering Heights,i should guess it was her own    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,she degenerates into a mere slut  she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.
Wuthering Heights,you   d hardly credit it  but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home.
Wuthering Heights,however  she   ll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice  and i   ll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.
Wuthering Heights,well  sir    returned i     i hope you   ll consider that mrs. heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on  and that she has been brought up like an only daughter  whom every one was ready to serve.
Wuthering Heights,you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her  and you must treat her kindly.
Wuthering Heights,whatever be your notion of mr. edgar  you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments  or she wouldn   t have abandoned the elegancies  and comforts  and friends of her former home  to fix contentedly  in such a wilderness as this  with you.
Wuthering Heights,she abandoned them under a delusion    he answered     picturing in me a hero of romance  and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion.
Wuthering Heights,i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature  so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.
Wuthering Heights,but  at last  i think she begins to know me  i don   t perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first  and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself.
Wuthering Heights,it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her.
Wuthering Heights,i believed  at one time  no lessons could teach her that  and yet it is poorly learnt  for this morning she announced  as a piece of appalling intelligence  that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me  a positive labour of hercules  i assure you  if it be achieved  i have cause to return thanks.
Wuthering Heights,can i trust your assertion  isabella  are you sure you hate me  if i let you alone for half a day  won   t you come sighing and wheedling to me again  i daresay she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you  it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed.
Wuthering Heights,but i don   t care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side  and i never told her a lie about it.
Wuthering Heights,she cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.
Wuthering Heights,the first thing she saw me do  on coming out of the grange  was to hang up her little dog  and when she pleaded for it  the first words i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her  except one  possibly she took that exception for herself.
Wuthering Heights,but no brutality disgusted her  i suppose she has an innate admiration of it  if only her precious person were secure from injury  now  was it not the depth of absurdity   of genuine idiocy  for that pitiful  slavish  mean minded brach to dream that i could love her  tell your master  nelly  that i never  in all my life  met with such an abject thing as she is.
Wuthering Heights,she even disgraces the name of linton  and i   ve sometimes relented  from pure lack of invention  in my experiments on what she could endure  and still creep shamefully cringing back  but tell him  also  to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease  that i keep strictly within the limits of the law.
Wuthering Heights,i have avoided  up to this period  giving her the slightest right to claim a separation  and  what   s more  she   d thank nobody for dividing us.
Wuthering Heights,if she desired to go  she might  the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her        mr. heathcliff    said i     this is the talk of a madman  your wife  most likely  is convinced you are mad  and  for that reason  she has borne with you hitherto  but now that you say she may go  she   ll doubtless avail herself of the permission.
Wuthering Heights,you are not so bewitched  ma   am  are you  as to remain with him of your own accord        take care  ellen    answered isabella  her eyes sparkling irefully  there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner   s endeavours to make himself detested.
Wuthering Heights,don   t put faith in a single word he speaks.
Wuthering Heights,he   s a lying fiend  a monster  and not a human being  i   ve been told i might leave him before  and i   ve made the attempt  but i dare not repeat it  only  ellen  promise you   ll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine.
Wuthering Heights,whatever he may pretend  he wishes to provoke edgar to desperation  he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him  and he sha   n   t obtain it   i   ll die first  i just hope  i pray  that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me  the single pleasure i can imagine is to die  or to see him dead        there   that will do for the present    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,if you are called upon in a court of law  you   ll remember her language  nelly  and take a good look at that countenance  she   s near the point which would suit me.
Wuthering Heights,no  you   re not fit to be your own guardian  isabella  now  and i  being your legal protector  must retain you in my custody  however distasteful the obligation may be.
Wuthering Heights,go upstairs  i have something to say to ellen dean in private.
Wuthering Heights,that   s not the way  upstairs  i tell you  why  this is the road upstairs  child     he seized  and thrust her from the room  and returned muttering      i have no pity  i have no pity  the more the worms writhe  the more i yearn to crush out their entrails  it is a moral teething  and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.
Wuthering Heights,do you understand what the word pity means    i said  hastening to resume my bonnet.
Wuthering Heights,did you ever feel a touch of it in your life        put that down    he interrupted  perceiving my intention to depart.
Wuthering Heights,you are not going yet.
Wuthering Heights,come here now  nelly  i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine  and that without delay.
Wuthering Heights,i swear that i meditate no harm  i don   t desire to cause any disturbance  or to exasperate or insult mr. linton  i only wish to hear from herself how she is  and why she has been ill  and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her.
Wuthering Heights,last night i was in the grange garden six hours  and i   ll return there to night  and every night i   ll haunt the place  and every day  till i find an opportunity of entering.
Wuthering Heights,if edgar linton meets me  i shall not hesitate to knock him down  and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay.
Wuthering Heights,if his servants oppose me  i shall threaten them off with these pistols.
Wuthering Heights,but wouldn   t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them  or their master  and you could do it so easily.
Wuthering Heights,i   d warn you when i came  and then you might let me in unobserved  as soon as she was alone  and watch till i departed  your conscience quite calm  you would be hindering mischief.
Wuthering Heights,i protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer   s house  and  besides  i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs. linton   s tranquillity for his satisfaction.
Wuthering Heights,the commonest occurrence startles her painfully    i said.
Wuthering Heights,she   s all nerves  and she couldn   t bear the surprise  i   m positive.
Wuthering Heights,don   t persist  sir  or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs  and he   ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions        in that case i   ll take measures to secure you  woman    exclaimed heathcliff     you shall not leave wuthering heights till to morrow morning.
Wuthering Heights,it is a foolish story to assert that catherine could not bear to see me  and as to surprising her  i don   t desire it  you must prepare her   ask her if i may come.
Wuthering Heights,you say she never mentions my name  and that i am never mentioned to her.
Wuthering Heights,to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house  she thinks you are all spies for her husband.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   ve no doubt she   s in hell among you  i guess by her silence  as much as anything  what she feels.
Wuthering Heights,you say she is often restless  and anxious looking  is that a proof of tranquillity  you talk of her mind being unsettled.
Wuthering Heights,how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation  and that insipid  paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity  from pity and charity  he might as well plant an oak in a flower pot  and expect it to thrive  as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares  let us settle it at once  will you stay here  and am i to fight my way to catherine over linton and his footman  or will you be my friend  as you have been hitherto  and do what i request  decide  because there is no reason for my lingering another minute  if you persist in your stubborn ill nature     well  mr. lockwood  i argued and complained  and flatly refused him fifty times  but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.
Wuthering Heights,i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress  and should she consent  i promised to let him have intelligence of linton   s next absence from home  when he might come  and get in as he was able  i wouldn   t be there  and my fellow servants should be equally out of the way.
Wuthering Heights,was it right or wrong  i fear it was wrong  though expedient.
Wuthering Heights,i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance  and i thought  too  it might create a favourable crisis in catherine   s mental illness  and then i remembered mr. edgar   s stern rebuke of my carrying tales  and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject  by affirming  with frequent iteration  that that betrayal of trust  if it merited so harsh an appellation  should be the last.
Wuthering Heights,notwithstanding  my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither  and many misgivings i had  ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs. linton   s hand.
Wuthering Heights,but here is kenneth  i   ll go down  and tell him how much better you are.
Wuthering Heights,my history is dree  as we say  and will serve to while away another morning.
Wuthering Heights,dree  and dreary  i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor  and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me.
Wuthering Heights,but never mind  i   ll extract wholesome medicines from mrs. dean   s bitter herbs  and firstly  let me beware of the fascination that lurks in catherine heathcliff   s brilliant eyes.
Wuthering Heights,i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person  and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.
Wuthering Heights,another week over   and i am so many days nearer health  and spring  i have now heard all my neighbour   s history  at different sittings  as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll continue it in her own words  only a little condensed.
Wuthering Heights,she is  on the whole  a very fair narrator  and i don   t think i could improve her style.
Wuthering Heights,in the evening  she said  the evening of my visit to the heights  i knew  as well as if i saw him  that mr. heathcliff was about the place  and i shunned going out  because i still carried his letter in my pocket  and didn   t want to be threatened or teased any more.
Wuthering Heights,i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere  as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine.
Wuthering Heights,the consequence was  that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.
Wuthering Heights,the fourth was sunday  and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.
Wuthering Heights,there was a man servant left to keep the house with me  and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service  but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open  and  to fulfil my engagement  as i knew who would be coming  i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges  and he must run over to the village and get a few  to be paid for on the morrow.
Wuthering Heights,he departed  and i went upstairs.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton sat in a loose white dress  with a light shawl over her shoulders  in the recess of the open window  as usual.
Wuthering Heights,her thick  long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness  and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.
Wuthering Heights,her appearance was altered  as i had told heathcliff  but when she was calm  there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.
Wuthering Heights,the flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness  they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her  they appeared always to gaze beyond  and far beyond   you would have said out of this world.
Wuthering Heights,then  the paleness of her face   its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh   and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state  though painfully suggestive of their causes  added to the touching interest which she awakened  and   invariably to me  i know  and to any person who saw her  i should think   refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence  and stamped her as one doomed to decay.
Wuthering Heights,a book lay spread on the sill before her  and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.
Wuthering Heights,i believe linton had laid it there  for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading  or occupation of any kind  and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement.
Wuthering Heights,she was conscious of his aim  and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly  only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh  and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses.
Wuthering Heights,at other times  she would turn petulantly away  and hide her face in her hands  or even push him off angrily  and then he took care to let her alone  for he was certain of doing no good.
Wuthering Heights,gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing  and the full  mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.
Wuthering Heights,it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage  which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf.
Wuthering Heights,at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain.
Wuthering Heights,and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking as she listened  that is  if she thought or listened at all  but she had the vague  distant look i mentioned before  which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a letter for you  mrs. linton    i said  gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee.
Wuthering Heights,you must read it immediately  because it wants an answer.
Wuthering Heights,shall i break the seal       yes    she answered  without altering the direction of her eyes.
Wuthering Heights,i opened it   it was very short.
Wuthering Heights,now    i continued     read it.
Wuthering Heights,she drew away her hand  and let it fall.
Wuthering Heights,i replaced it in her lap  and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down  but that movement was so long delayed that at last i resumed      must i read it  ma   am  it is from mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection  and a struggle to arrange her ideas.
Wuthering Heights,she lifted the letter  and seemed to peruse it  and when she came to the signature she sighed  yet still i found she had not gathered its import  for  upon my desiring to hear her reply  she merely pointed to the name  and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness.
Wuthering Heights,well  he wishes to see you    said i  guessing her need of an interpreter.
Wuthering Heights,he   s in the garden by this time  and impatient to know what answer i shall bring.
Wuthering Heights,as i spoke  i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark  and then smoothing them back  announce  by a wag of the tail  that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton bent forward  and listened breathlessly.
Wuthering Heights,the minute after a step traversed the hall  the open house was too tempting for heathcliff to resist walking in  most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise  and so resolved to trust to his own audacity.
Wuthering Heights,with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber.
Wuthering Heights,he did not hit the right room directly  she motioned me to admit him  but he found it out ere i could reach the door  and in a stride or two was at her side  and had her grasped in his arms.
Wuthering Heights,he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes  during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before  i daresay  but then my mistress had kissed him first  and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear  for downright agony  to look into her face  the same conviction had stricken him as me  from the instant he beheld her  that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there   she was fated  sure to die.
Wuthering Heights,oh  cathy  oh  my life  how can i bear it    was the first sentence he uttered  in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.
Wuthering Heights,and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes  but they burned with anguish  they did not melt.
Wuthering Heights,what now    said catherine  leaning back  and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow  her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices.
Wuthering Heights,you and edgar have broken my heart  heathcliff  and you both come to bewail the deed to me  as if you were the people to be pitied  i shall not pity you  not i.
Wuthering Heights,you have killed me   and thriven on it  i think.
Wuthering Heights,how strong you are  how many years do you mean to live after i am gone     heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her  he attempted to rise  but she seized his hair  and kept him down.
Wuthering Heights,i wish i could hold you    she continued  bitterly     till we were both dead  i shouldn   t care what you suffered.
Wuthering Heights,i care nothing for your sufferings.
Wuthering Heights,why shouldn   t you suffer  i do  will you forget me  will you be happy when i am in the earth  will you say twenty years hence     that   s the grave of catherine earnshaw  i loved her long ago  and was wretched to lose her  but it is past.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve loved many others since  my children are dearer to me than she was  and  at death  i shall not rejoice that i am going to her  i shall be sorry that i must leave them     will you say so  heathcliff        don   t torture me till i   m as mad as yourself    cried he  wrenching his head free  and grinding his teeth.
Wuthering Heights,the two  to a cool spectator  made a strange and fearful picture.
Wuthering Heights,well might catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her  unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.
Wuthering Heights,her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek  and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye  and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping.
Wuthering Heights,as to her companion  while raising himself with one hand  he had taken her arm with the other  and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition  that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.
Wuthering Heights,are you possessed with a devil    he pursued  savagely     to talk in that manner to me when you are dying  do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory  and eating deeper eternally after you have left me  you know you lie to say i have killed you  and  catherine  you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence  is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness  that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell        i shall not be at peace    moaned catherine  recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent  unequal throbbing of her heart  which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.
Wuthering Heights,she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over  then she continued  more kindly        i   m not wishing you greater torment than i have  heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i only wish us never to be parted  and should a word of mine distress you hereafter  think i feel the same distress underground  and for my own sake  forgive me  come here and kneel down again  you never harmed me in your life.
Wuthering Heights,nay  if you nurse anger  that will be worse to remember than my harsh words  won   t you come here again  do     heathcliff went to the back of her chair  and leant over  but not so far as to let her see his face  which was livid with emotion.
Wuthering Heights,she bent round to look at him  he would not permit it  turning abruptly  he walked to the fireplace  where he stood  silent  with his back towards us.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. linton   s glance followed him suspiciously  every movement woke a new sentiment in her.
Wuthering Heights,after a pause and a prolonged gaze  she resumed  addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment         oh  you see  nelly  he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave.
Wuthering Heights,that is how i   m loved  well  never mind.
Wuthering Heights,that is not my heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i shall love mine yet  and take him with me  he   s in my soul.
Wuthering Heights,and    added she musingly     the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison  after all.
Wuthering Heights,i   m tired of being enclosed here.
Wuthering Heights,i   m wearying to escape into that glorious world  and to be always there  not seeing it dimly through tears  and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart  but really with it  and in it.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  you think you are better and more fortunate than i  in full health and strength  you are sorry for me   very soon that will be altered.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be sorry for you.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.
Wuthering Heights,i wonder he won   t be near me    she went on to herself.
Wuthering Heights,i thought he wished it.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  dear  you should not be sullen now.
Wuthering Heights,do come to me  heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.
Wuthering Heights,at that earnest appeal he turned to her  looking absolutely desperate.
Wuthering Heights,his eyes  wide and wet  at last flashed fiercely on her  his breast heaved convulsively.
Wuthering Heights,an instant they held asunder  and then how they met i hardly saw  but catherine made a spring  and he caught her  and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive  in fact  to my eyes  she seemed directly insensible.
Wuthering Heights,he flung himself into the nearest seat  and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted  he gnashed at me  and foamed like a mad dog  and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.
Wuthering Heights,i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species  it appeared that he would not understand  though i spoke to him  so i stood off  and held my tongue  in great perplexity.
Wuthering Heights,a movement of catherine   s relieved me a little presently  she put up her hand to clasp his neck  and bring her cheek to his as he held her  while he  in return  covering her with frantic caresses  said wildly        you teach me now how cruel you   ve been   cruel and false.
Wuthering Heights,why did you despise me  why did you betray your own heart  cathy  i have not one word of comfort.
Wuthering Heights,you deserve this.
Wuthering Heights,you have killed yourself.
Wuthering Heights,yes  you may kiss me  and cry  and wring out my kisses and tears  they   ll blight you   they   ll damn you.
Wuthering Heights,you loved me   then what right had you to leave me  what right   answer me   for the poor fancy you felt for linton  because misery and degradation  and death  and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us  you  of your own will  did it.
Wuthering Heights,i have not broken your heart   you have broken it  and in breaking it  you have broken mine.
Wuthering Heights,so much the worse for me that i am strong.
Wuthering Heights,do i want to live  what kind of living will it be when you   oh  god  would you like to live with your soul in the grave        let me alone.
Wuthering Heights,let me alone    sobbed catherine.
Wuthering Heights,if i   ve done wrong  i   m dying for it.
Wuthering Heights,it is enough  you left me too  but i won   t upbraid you  i forgive you.
Wuthering Heights,forgive me        it is hard to forgive  and to look at those eyes  and feel those wasted hands    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,kiss me again  and don   t let me see your eyes  i forgive what you have done to me.
Wuthering Heights,i love my murderer   but yours  how can i     they were silent   their faces hid against each other  and washed by each other   s tears.
Wuthering Heights,at least  i suppose the weeping was on both sides  as it seemed heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.
Wuthering Heights,i grew very uncomfortable  meanwhile  for the afternoon wore fast away  the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand  and i could distinguish  by the shine of the western sun up the valley  a concourse thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch.
Wuthering Heights,service is over    i announced.
Wuthering Heights,my master will be here in half an hour.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff groaned a curse  and strained catherine closer  she never moved.
Wuthering Heights,ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton was not far behind  he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up  probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.
Wuthering Heights,now he is here    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,for heaven   s sake  hurry down  you   ll not meet any one on the front stairs.
Wuthering Heights,do be quick  and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.
Wuthering Heights,i must go  cathy    said heathcliff  seeking to extricate himself from his companion   s arms.
Wuthering Heights,but if i live  i   ll see you again before you are asleep.
Wuthering Heights,i won   t stray five yards from your window.
Wuthering Heights,you must not go    she answered  holding him as firmly as her strength allowed.
Wuthering Heights,you shall not  i tell you.
Wuthering Heights,for one hour    he pleaded earnestly.
Wuthering Heights,not for one minute    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,i must   linton will be up immediately    persisted the alarmed intruder.
Wuthering Heights,he would have risen  and unfixed her fingers by the act   she clung fast  gasping  there was mad resolution in her face.
Wuthering Heights,no    she shrieked.
Wuthering Heights,oh  don   t  don   t go.
Wuthering Heights,it is the last time  edgar will not hurt us.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  i shall die  i shall die        damn the fool  there he is    cried heathcliff  sinking back into his seat.
Wuthering Heights,hush  my darling  hush  hush  catherine  i   ll stay.
Wuthering Heights,if he shot me so  i   d expire with a blessing on my lips.
Wuthering Heights,and there they were fast again.
Wuthering Heights,i heard my master mounting the stairs   the cold sweat ran from my forehead  i was horrified.
Wuthering Heights,are you going to listen to her ravings    i said  passionately.
Wuthering Heights,she does not know what she says.
Wuthering Heights,will you ruin her  because she has not wit to help herself  get up  you could be free instantly.
Wuthering Heights,that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did.
Wuthering Heights,we are all done for   master  mistress  and servant.
Wuthering Heights,i wrung my hands  and cried out  and mr. linton hastened his step at the noise.
Wuthering Heights,in the midst of my agitation  i was sincerely glad to observe that catherine   s arms had fallen relaxed  and her head hung down.
Wuthering Heights,she   s fainted  or dead    i thought     so much the better.
Wuthering Heights,far better that she should be dead  than lingering a burden and a misery maker to all about her.
Wuthering Heights,edgar sprang to his unbidden guest  blanched with astonishment and rage.
Wuthering Heights,what he meant to do i cannot tell  however  the other stopped all demonstrations  at once  by placing the lifeless looking form in his arms.
Wuthering Heights,look there    he said.
Wuthering Heights,unless you be a fiend  help her first   then you shall speak to me     he walked into the parlour  and sat down.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton summoned me  and with great difficulty  and after resorting to many means  we managed to restore her to sensation  but she was all bewildered  she sighed  and moaned  and knew nobody.
Wuthering Heights,edgar  in his anxiety for her  forgot her hated friend.
Wuthering Heights,i did not.
Wuthering Heights,i went  at the earliest opportunity  and besought him to depart  affirming that catherine was better  and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not refuse to go out of doors    he answered     but i shall stay in the garden  and  nelly  mind you keep your word to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be under those larch trees.
Wuthering Heights,mind  or i pay another visit  whether linton be in or not.
Wuthering Heights,he sent a rapid glance through the half open door of the chamber  and  ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true  delivered the house of his luckless presence.
Wuthering Heights,about twelve o   clock that night was born the catherine you saw at wuthering heights  a puny  seven months    child  and two hours after the mother died  having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss heathcliff  or know edgar.
Wuthering Heights,the latter   s distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on  its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.
Wuthering Heights,a great addition  in my eyes  was his being left without an heir.
Wuthering Heights,i bemoaned that  as i gazed on the feeble orphan  and i mentally abused old linton for  what was only natural partiality  the securing his estate to his own daughter  instead of his son   s. an unwelcomed infant it was  poor thing  it might have wailed out of life  and nobody cared a morsel  during those first hours of existence.
Wuthering Heights,we redeemed the neglect afterwards  but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.
Wuthering Heights,next morning   bright and cheerful out of doors   stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room  and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow  tender glow.
Wuthering Heights,edgar linton had his head laid on the pillow  and his eyes shut.
Wuthering Heights,his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him  and almost as fixed  but his was the hush of exhausted anguish  and hers of perfect peace.
Wuthering Heights,her brow smooth  her lids closed  her lips wearing the expression of a smile  no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.
Wuthering Heights,and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay  my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest.
Wuthering Heights,i instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before     incomparably beyond and above us all  whether still on earth or now in heaven  her spirit is at home with god     i don   t know if it be a peculiarity in me  but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death  should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me.
Wuthering Heights,i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break  and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter   the eternity they have entered   where life is boundless in its duration  and love in its sympathy  and joy in its fulness.
Wuthering Heights,i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr. linton   s  when he so regretted catherine   s blessed release  to be sure  one might have doubted  after the wayward and impatient existence she had led  whether she merited a haven of peace at last.
Wuthering Heights,one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection  but not then  in the presence of her corpse.
Wuthering Heights,it asserted its own tranquillity  which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.
Wuthering Heights,do you believe such people are happy in the other world  sir  i   d give a great deal to know.
Wuthering Heights,i declined answering mrs. dean   s question  which struck me as something heterodox.
Wuthering Heights,she proceeded   retracing the course of catherine linton  i fear we have no right to think she is  but we   ll leave her with her maker.
Wuthering Heights,the master looked asleep  and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.
Wuthering Heights,the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch  in reality  my chief motive was seeing mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,if he had remained among the larches all night  he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange  unless  perhaps  he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton.
Wuthering Heights,if he had come nearer  he would probably be aware  from the lights flitting to and fro  and the opening and shutting of the outer doors  that all was not right within.
Wuthering Heights,i wished  yet feared  to find him.
Wuthering Heights,i felt the terrible news must be told  and i longed to get it over  but how to do it i did not know.
Wuthering Heights,he was there   at least  a few yards further in the park  leant against an old ash tree  his hat off  and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches  and fell pattering round him.
Wuthering Heights,he had been standing a long time in that position  for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him  busy in building their nest  and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber.
Wuthering Heights,they flew off at my approach  and he raised his eyes and spoke       she   s dead    he said     i   ve not waited for you to learn that.
Wuthering Heights,put your handkerchief away   don   t snivel before me.
Wuthering Heights,damn you all  she wants none of your tears     i was weeping as much for him as her  we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.
Wuthering Heights,when i first looked into his face  i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe  and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed  because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.
Wuthering Heights,yes  she   s dead    i answered  checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.
Wuthering Heights,gone to heaven  i hope  where we may  every one  join her  if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good        did she take due warning  then    asked heathcliff  attempting a sneer.
Wuthering Heights,did she die like a saint  come  give me a true history of the event.
Wuthering Heights,how did        he endeavoured to pronounce the name  but could not manage it  and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony  defying  meanwhile  my sympathy with an unflinching  ferocious stare.
Wuthering Heights,how did she die    he resumed  at last   fain  notwithstanding his hardihood  to have a support behind him  for  after the struggle  he trembled  in spite of himself  to his very finger ends.
Wuthering Heights,poor wretch    i thought     you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men  why should you be anxious to conceal them  your pride cannot blind god  you tempt him to wring them  till he forces a cry of humiliation.
Wuthering Heights,quietly as a lamb    i answered  aloud.
Wuthering Heights,she drew a sigh  and stretched herself  like a child reviving  and sinking again to sleep  and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart  and nothing more        and   did she ever mention me    he asked  hesitating  as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear.
Wuthering Heights,her senses never returned  she recognised nobody from the time you left her    i said.
Wuthering Heights,she lies with a sweet smile on her face  and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.
Wuthering Heights,her life closed in a gentle dream   may she wake as kindly in the other world        may she wake in torment    he cried  with frightful vehemence  stamping his foot  and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.
Wuthering Heights,why  she   s a liar to the end  where is she  not there   not in heaven   not perished   where  oh  you said you cared nothing for my sufferings  and i pray one prayer   i repeat it till my tongue stiffens   catherine earnshaw  may you not rest as long as i am living  you said i killed you   haunt me  then  the murdered do haunt their murderers  i believe.
Wuthering Heights,i know that ghosts have wandered on earth.
Wuthering Heights,be with me always   take any form   drive me mad  only do not leave me in this abyss  where i cannot find you  oh  god  it is unutterable  i cannot live without my life  i cannot live without my soul     he dashed his head against the knotted trunk  and  lifting up his eyes  howled  not like a man  but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.
Wuthering Heights,i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree  and his hand and forehead were both stained  probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.
Wuthering Heights,it hardly moved my compassion   it appalled me  still  i felt reluctant to quit him so.
Wuthering Heights,but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching  he thundered a command for me to go  and i obeyed.
Wuthering Heights,he was beyond my skill to quiet or console   mrs. linton   s funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease  and till then her coffin remained uncovered  and strewn with flowers and scented leaves  in the great drawing room.
Wuthering Heights,linton spent his days and nights there  a sleepless guardian  and   a circumstance concealed from all but me   heathcliff spent his nights  at least  outside  equally a stranger to repose.
Wuthering Heights,i held no communication with him  still  i was conscious of his design to enter  if he could  and on the tuesday  a little after dark  when my master  from sheer fatigue  had been compelled to retire a couple of hours  i went and opened one of the windows  moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu.
Wuthering Heights,he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity  cautiously and briefly  too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.
Wuthering Heights,indeed  i shouldn   t have discovered that he had been there  except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse   s face  and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair  fastened with a silver thread  which  on examination  i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round catherine   s neck.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents  replacing them by a black lock of his own.
Wuthering Heights,i twisted the two  and enclosed them together.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw was  of course  invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave  he sent no excuse  but he never came  so that  besides her husband  the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
Wuthering Heights,isabella was not asked.
Wuthering Heights,the place of catherine   s interment  to the surprise of the villagers  was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons  nor yet by the tombs of her own relations  outside.
Wuthering Heights,it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard  where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor  and peat mould almost buries it.
Wuthering Heights,her husband lies in the same spot now  and they have each a simple headstone above  and a plain grey block at their feet  to mark the graves.
Wuthering Heights,that friday made the last of our fine days for a month.
Wuthering Heights,in the evening the weather broke  the wind shifted from south to north east  and brought rain first  and then sleet and snow.
Wuthering Heights,on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer  the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts  the larks were silent  the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.
Wuthering Heights,and dreary  and chill  and dismal  that morrow did creep over  my master kept his room  i took possession of the lonely parlour  converting it into a nursery  and there i was  sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee  rocking it to and fro  and watching  meanwhile  the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window  when the door opened  and some person entered  out of breath and laughing  my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute.
Wuthering Heights,i supposed it one of the maids  and i cried      have done  how dare you show your giddiness here  what would mr. linton say if he heard you        excuse me    answered a familiar voice     but i know edgar is in bed  and i cannot stop myself.
Wuthering Heights,with that the speaker came forward to the fire  panting and holding her hand to her side.
Wuthering Heights,i have run the whole way from wuthering heights    she continued  after a pause     except where i   ve flown.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t count the number of falls i   ve had.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   m aching all over  don   t be alarmed  there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it  only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton  and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.
Wuthering Heights,the intruder was mrs. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament  her hair streamed on her shoulders  dripping with snow and water  she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore  befitting her age more than her position  a low frock with short sleeves  and nothing on either head or neck.
Wuthering Heights,the frock was of light silk  and clung to her with wet  and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers  add to this a deep cut under one ear  which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely  a white face scratched and bruised  and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue  and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her.
Wuthering Heights,my dear young lady    i exclaimed     i   ll stir nowhere  and hear nothing  till you have removed every article of your clothes  and put on dry things  and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton to night  so it is needless to order the carriage.
Wuthering Heights,certainly i shall    she said     walking or riding  yet i   ve no objection to dress myself decently.
Wuthering Heights,and   ah  see how it flows down my neck now  the fire does make it smart.
Wuthering Heights,she insisted on my fulfilling her directions  before she would let me touch her  and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready  and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire  did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.
Wuthering Heights,now  ellen    she said  when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy chair on the hearth  with a cup of tea before her     you sit down opposite me  and put poor catherine   s baby away  i don   t like to see it  you mustn   t think i care little for catherine  because i behaved so foolishly on entering  i   ve cried  too  bitterly   yes  more than any one else has reason to cry.
Wuthering Heights,we parted unreconciled  you remember  and i sha   n   t forgive myself.
Wuthering Heights,but  for all that  i was not going to sympathise with him   the brute beast  oh  give me the poker  this is the last thing of his i have about me    she slipped the gold ring from her third finger  and threw it on the floor.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll smash it    she continued  striking it with childish spite     and then i   ll burn it    and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.
Wuthering Heights,there  he shall buy another  if he gets me back again.
Wuthering Heights,he   d be capable of coming to seek me  to tease edgar.
Wuthering Heights,i dare not stay  lest that notion should possess his wicked head  and besides  edgar has not been kind  has he  and i won   t come suing for his assistance  nor will i bring him into more trouble.
Wuthering Heights,necessity compelled me to seek shelter here  though  if i had not learned he was out of the way  i   d have halted at the kitchen  washed my face  warmed myself  got you to bring what i wanted  and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed   of that incarnate goblin  ah  he was in such a fury  if he had caught me  it   s a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength  i wouldn   t have run till i   d seen him all but demolished  had hindley been able to do it        well  don   t talk so fast  miss    i interrupted     you   ll disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face  and make the cut bleed again.
Wuthering Heights,drink your tea  and take breath  and give over laughing  laughter is sadly out of place under this roof  and in your condition        an undeniable truth    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,listen to that child  it maintains a constant wail   send it out of my hearing for an hour  i sha   n   t stay any longer.
Wuthering Heights,i rang the bell  and committed it to a servant   s care  and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight  and where she meant to go  as she refused remaining with us.
Wuthering Heights,i ought  and i wished to remain    answered she     to cheer edgar and take care of the baby  for two things  and because the grange is my right home.
Wuthering Heights,but i tell you he wouldn   t let me  do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry   could bear to think that we were tranquil  and not resolve on poisoning our comfort  now  i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me  to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear shot or eyesight  i notice  when i enter his presence  the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred  partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him  and partly from original aversion.
Wuthering Heights,it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england  supposing i contrived a clear escape  and therefore i must get quite away.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve recovered from my first desire to be killed by him  i   d rather he   d kill himself  he has extinguished my love effectually  and so i   m at my ease.
Wuthering Heights,i can recollect yet how i loved him  and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him  if   no  no  even if he had doted on me  the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow.
Wuthering Heights,catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly  knowing him so well.
Wuthering Heights,monster  would that he could be blotted out of creation  and out of my memory        hush  hush  he   s a human being    i said.
Wuthering Heights,be more charitable  there are worse men than he is yet        he   s not a human being    she retorted     and he has no claim on my charity.
Wuthering Heights,i gave him my heart  and he took and pinched it to death  and flung it back to me.
Wuthering Heights,people feel with their hearts  ellen  and since he has destroyed mine  i have not power to feel for him  and i would not  though he groaned from this to his dying day  and wept tears of blood for catherine  no  indeed  indeed  i wouldn   t    and here isabella began to cry  but  immediately dashing the water from her lashes  she recommenced.
Wuthering Heights,you asked  what has driven me to flight at last  i was compelled to attempt it  because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.
Wuthering Heights,pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head.
Wuthering Heights,he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of  and proceeded to murderous violence.
Wuthering Heights,i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him  the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self preservation  so i fairly broke free  and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.
Wuthering Heights,yesterday  you know  mr. earnshaw should have been at the funeral.
Wuthering Heights,he kept himself sober for the purpose   tolerably sober  not going to bed mad at six o   clock and getting up drunk at twelve.
Wuthering Heights,consequently  he rose  in suicidal low spirits  as fit for the church as for a dance  and instead  he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff   i shudder to name him  has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till to day.
Wuthering Heights,whether the angels have fed him  or his kin beneath  i cannot tell  but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.
Wuthering Heights,he has just come home at dawn  and gone upstairs to his chamber  locking himself in   as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company  there he has continued  praying like a methodist  only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes  and god  when addressed  was curiously confounded with his own black father  after concluding these precious orisons   and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat   he would be off again  always straight down to the grange  i wonder edgar did not send for a constable  and give him into custody  for me  grieved as i was about catherine  it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.
Wuthering Heights,i recovered spirits sufficient to hear joseph   s eternal lectures without weeping  and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly.
Wuthering Heights,you wouldn   t think that i should cry at anything joseph could say  but he and hareton are detestable companions.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather sit with hindley  and hear his awful talk  than with    t    little maister    and his staunch supporter  that odious old man  when heathcliff is in  i   m often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society  or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers  when he is not  as was the case this week  i establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire  and never mind how mr. earnshaw may occupy himself  and he does not interfere with my arrangements.
Wuthering Heights,he is quieter now than he used to be  if no one provokes him  more sullen and depressed  and less furious.
Wuthering Heights,joseph affirms he   s sure he   s an altered man  that the lord has touched his heart  and he is saved    so as by fire.
Wuthering Heights,i   m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change  but it is not my business.
Wuthering Heights,yester evening i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve.
Wuthering Heights,it seemed so dismal to go upstairs  with the wild snow blowing outside  and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new made grave  i dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me  that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.
Wuthering Heights,hindley sat opposite  his head leant on his hand  perhaps meditating on the same subject.
Wuthering Heights,he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality  and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours.
Wuthering Heights,there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind  which shook the windows every now and then  the faint crackling of the coals  and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.
Wuthering Heights,hareton and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed.
Wuthering Heights,it was very  very sad  and while i read i sighed  for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world  never to be restored.
Wuthering Heights,the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch  heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual  owing  i suppose  to the sudden storm.
Wuthering Heights,that entrance was fastened  and we heard him coming round to get in by the other.
Wuthering Heights,i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips  which induced my companion  who had been staring towards the door  to turn and look at me.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll keep him out five minutes     he exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,you won   t object            no  you may keep him out the whole night for me     i answered.
Wuthering Heights,do  put the key in the lock  and draw the bolts.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front  he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table  leaning over it  and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his  as he both looked and felt like an assassin  he couldn   t exactly find that  but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.
Wuthering Heights,you  and i     he said     have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder  if we were neither of us cowards  we might combine to discharge it.
Wuthering Heights,are you as soft as your brother  are you willing to endure to the last  and not once attempt a repayment            i   m weary of enduring now     i replied     and i   d be glad of a retaliation that wouldn   t recoil on myself  but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends  they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies.
Wuthering Heights,treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence     cried hindley.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff  i   ll ask you to do nothing  but sit still and be dumb.
Wuthering Heights,tell me now  can you  i   m sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend   s existence  he   ll be your death unless you overreach him  and he   ll be my ruin.
Wuthering Heights,damn the hellish villain  he knocks at the door as if he were master here already  promise to hold your tongue  and before that clock strikes   it wants three minutes of one   you   re a free woman         he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast  and would have turned down the candle.
Wuthering Heights,i snatched it away  however  and seized his arm.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not hold my tongue     i said     you mustn   t touch him.
Wuthering Heights,let the door remain shut  and be quiet            no  i   ve formed my resolution  and by god i   ll execute it     cried the desperate being.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself  and hareton justice  and you needn   t trouble your head to screen me  catherine is gone.
Wuthering Heights,nobody alive would regret me  or be ashamed  though i cut my throat this minute   and it   s time to make an end         i might as well have struggled with a bear  or reasoned with a lunatic.
Wuthering Heights,the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him.
Wuthering Heights,you   d better seek shelter somewhere else to night     i exclaimed  in rather a triumphant tone.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw has a mind to shoot you  if you persist in endeavouring to enter.
Wuthering Heights,you   d better open the door  you       he answered  addressing me by some elegant term that i don   t care to repeat.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not meddle in the matter     i retorted again.
Wuthering Heights,come in and get shot  if you please.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve done my duty.
Wuthering Heights,with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire  having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw swore passionately at me  affirming that i loved the villain yet  and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced.
Wuthering Heights,and i  in my secret heart  and conscience never reproached me   thought what a blessing it would be for him should heathcliff put him out of misery  and what a blessing for me should he send heathcliff to his right abode  as i sat nursing these reflections  the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual  and his black countenance looked blightingly through.
Wuthering Heights,the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow  and i smiled  exulting in my fancied security.
Wuthering Heights,his hair and clothes were whitened with snow  and his sharp cannibal teeth  revealed by cold and wrath  gleamed through the dark.
Wuthering Heights,isabella  let me in  or i   ll make you repent     he    girned     as joseph calls it.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot commit murder     i replied.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol.
Wuthering Heights,let me in by the kitchen door     he said.
Wuthering Heights,hindley will be there before me     i answered     and that   s a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow  we were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone  but the moment a blast of winter returns  you must run for shelter  heathcliff  if i were you  i   d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog.
Wuthering Heights,the world is surely not worth living in now  is it  you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine was the whole joy of your life  i can   t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.
Wuthering Heights,he   s there  is he     exclaimed my companion  rushing to the gap.
Wuthering Heights,if i can get my arm out i can hit him         i   m afraid  ellen  you   ll set me down as really wicked  but you don   t know all  so don   t judge.
Wuthering Heights,i wouldn   t have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything.
Wuthering Heights,wish that he were dead  i must  and therefore i was fearfully disappointed  and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech  when he flung himself on earnshaw   s weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.
Wuthering Heights,the charge exploded  and the knife  in springing back  closed into its owner   s wrist.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff pulled it away by main force  slitting up the flesh as it passed on  and thrust it dripping into his pocket.
Wuthering Heights,he then took a stone  struck down the division between two windows  and sprang in.
Wuthering Heights,his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood  that gushed from an artery or a large vein.
Wuthering Heights,the ruffian kicked and trampled on him  and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags  holding me with one hand  meantime  to prevent me summoning joseph.
Wuthering Heights,he exerted preterhuman self denial in abstaining from finishing him completely  but getting out of breath  he finally desisted  and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.
Wuthering Heights,there he tore off the sleeve of earnshaw   s coat  and bound up the wound with brutal roughness  spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before.
Wuthering Heights,being at liberty  i lost no time in seeking the old servant  who  having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale  hurried below  gasping  as he descended the steps two at once.
Wuthering Heights,what is ther to do  now  what is ther to do  now            there   s this to do     thundered heathcliff     that your master   s mad  and should he last another month  i   ll have him to an asylum.
Wuthering Heights,and how the devil did you come to fasten me out  you toothless hound  don   t stand muttering and mumbling there.
Wuthering Heights,come  i   m not going to nurse him.
Wuthering Heights,wash that stuff away  and mind the sparks of your candle   it is more than half brandy            and so ye   ve been murthering on him     exclaimed joseph  lifting his hands and eyes in horror.
Wuthering Heights,if iver i seed a seeght loike this  may the lord           heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood  and flung a towel to him  but instead of proceeding to dry it up  he joined his hands and began a prayer  which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology.
Wuthering Heights,i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing  in fact  i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i forgot you     said the tyrant.
Wuthering Heights,you shall do that.
Wuthering Heights,down with you.
Wuthering Heights,and you conspire with him against me  do you  viper  there  that is work fit for you         he shook me till my teeth rattled  and pitched me beside joseph  who steadily concluded his supplications  and then rose  vowing he would set off for the grange directly.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton was a magistrate  and though he had fifty wives dead  he should inquire into this.
Wuthering Heights,he was so obstinate in his resolution  that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place  standing over me  heaving with malevolence  as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions.
Wuthering Heights,it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that heathcliff was not the aggressor  especially with my hardly wrung replies.
Wuthering Heights,however  mr. earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still  joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits  and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff  aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible  called him deliriously intoxicated  and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further  but advised him to get to bed.
Wuthering Heights,to my joy  he left us  after giving this judicious counsel  and hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.
Wuthering Heights,i departed to my own room  marvelling that i had escaped so easily.
Wuthering Heights,this morning  when i came down  about half an hour before noon  mr. earnshaw was sitting by the fire  deadly sick  his evil genius  almost as gaunt and ghastly  leant against the chimney.
Wuthering Heights,neither appeared inclined to dine  and  having waited till all was cold on the table  i commenced alone.
Wuthering Heights,nothing hindered me from eating heartily  and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority  as  at intervals  i cast a look towards my silent companions  and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me.
Wuthering Heights,after i had done  i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire  going round earnshaw   s seat  and kneeling in the corner beside him.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff did not glance my way  and i gazed up  and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.
Wuthering Heights,his forehead  that i once thought so manly  and that i now think so diabolical  was shaded with a heavy cloud  his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness  and weeping  perhaps  for the lashes were wet then  his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer  and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness.
Wuthering Heights,had it been another  i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief.
Wuthering Heights,in his case  i was gratified  and  ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy  i couldn   t miss this chance of sticking in a dart  his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.
Wuthering Heights,fie  fie  miss    i interrupted.
Wuthering Heights,one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life.
Wuthering Heights,if god afflict your enemies  surely that ought to suffice you.
Wuthering Heights,it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his        in general i   ll allow that it would be  ellen    she continued     but what misery laid on heathcliff could content me  unless i have a hand in it  i   d rather he suffered less  if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i owe him so much.
Wuthering Heights,on only one condition can i hope to forgive him.
Wuthering Heights,it is  if i may take an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth  for every wrench of agony return a wrench  reduce him to my level.
Wuthering Heights,as he was the first to injure  make him the first to implore pardon  and then   why then  ellen  i might show you some generosity.
Wuthering Heights,but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged  and therefore i cannot forgive him.
Wuthering Heights,hindley wanted some water  and i handed him a glass  and asked him how he was.
Wuthering Heights,not as ill as i wish     he replied.
Wuthering Heights,but leaving out my arm  every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps            yes  no wonder     was my next remark.
Wuthering Heights,catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm  she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her.
Wuthering Heights,it   s well people don   t really rise from their grave  or  last night  she might have witnessed a repulsive scene  are not you bruised  and cut over your chest and shoulders            i can   t say     he answered     but what do you mean  did he dare to strike me when i was down            he trampled on and kicked you  and dashed you on the ground     i whispered.
Wuthering Heights,and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth  because he   s only half man  not so much  and the rest fiend.
Wuthering Heights,mr. earnshaw looked up  like me  to the countenance of our mutual foe  who  absorbed in his anguish  seemed insensible to anything around him  the longer he stood  the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.
Wuthering Heights,oh  if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony  i   d go to hell with joy     groaned the impatient man  writhing to rise  and sinking back in despair  convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle.
Wuthering Heights,nay  it   s enough that he has murdered one of you     i observed aloud.
Wuthering Heights,at the grange  every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,after all  it is preferable to be hated than loved by him.
Wuthering Heights,when i recollect how happy we were   how happy catherine was before he came   i   m fit to curse the day.
Wuthering Heights,most likely  heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said  than the spirit of the person who said it.
Wuthering Heights,his attention was roused  i saw  for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes  and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs.
Wuthering Heights,i stared full at him  and laughed scornfully.
Wuthering Heights,the clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me  the fiend which usually looked out  however  was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.
Wuthering Heights,get up  and begone out of my sight     said the mourner.
Wuthering Heights,i guessed he uttered those words  at least  though his voice was hardly intelligible.
Wuthering Heights,i beg your pardon     i replied.
Wuthering Heights,but i loved catherine too  and her brother requires attendance  which  for her sake  i shall supply.
Wuthering Heights,now that she   s dead  i see her in hindley  hindley has exactly her eyes  if you had not tried to gouge them out  and made them black and red  and her              get up  wretched idiot  before i stamp you to death     he cried  making a movement that caused me to make one also.
Wuthering Heights,but then     i continued  holding myself ready to flee     if poor catherine had trusted you  and assumed the ridiculous  contemptible  degrading title of mrs. heathcliff  she would soon have presented a similar picture  she wouldn   t have borne your abominable behaviour quietly  her detestation and disgust must have found voice.
Wuthering Heights,the back of the settle and earnshaw   s person interposed between me and him  so instead of endeavouring to reach me  he snatched a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head.
Wuthering Heights,it struck beneath my ear  and stopped the sentence i was uttering  but  pulling it out  i sprang to the door and delivered another  which i hope went a little deeper than his missile.
Wuthering Heights,the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part  checked by the embrace of his host  and both fell locked together on the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master  i knocked over hareton  who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway  and  blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory  i bounded  leaped  and flew down the steep road  then  quitting its windings  shot direct across the moor  rolling over banks  and wading through marshes  precipitating myself  in fact  towards the beacon light of the grange.
Wuthering Heights,and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than  even for one night  abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again.
Wuthering Heights,isabella ceased speaking  and took a drink of tea  then she rose  and bidding me put on her bonnet  and a great shawl i had brought  and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour  she stepped on to a chair  kissed edgar   s and catherine   s portraits  bestowed a similar salute on me  and descended to the carriage  accompanied by fanny  who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.
Wuthering Heights,she was driven away  never to revisit this neighbourhood  but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled.
Wuthering Heights,i believe her new abode was in the south  near london  there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.
Wuthering Heights,he was christened linton  and  from the first  she reported him to be an ailing  peevish creature.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  meeting me one day in the village  inquired where she lived.
Wuthering Heights,i refused to tell.
Wuthering Heights,he remarked that it was not of any moment  only she must beware of coming to her brother  she should not be with him  if he had to keep her himself.
Wuthering Heights,though i would give no information  he discovered  through some of the other servants  both her place of residence and the existence of the child.
Wuthering Heights,still  he didn   t molest her  for which forbearance she might thank his aversion  i suppose.
Wuthering Heights,he often asked about the infant  when he saw me  and on hearing its name  smiled grimly  and observed     they wish me to hate it too  do they        i don   t think they wish you to know anything about it    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ll have it    he said     when i want it.
Wuthering Heights,they may reckon on that     fortunately its mother died before the time arrived  some thirteen years after the decease of catherine  when linton was twelve  or a little more.
Wuthering Heights,on the day succeeding isabella   s unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master  he shunned conversation  and was fit for discussing nothing.
Wuthering Heights,when i could get him to listen  i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband  whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.
Wuthering Heights,so deep and sensitive was his aversion  that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,grief  and that together  transformed him into a complete hermit  he threw up his office of magistrate  ceased even to attend church  avoided the village on all occasions  and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds  only varied by solitary rambles on the moors  and visits to the grave of his wife  mostly at evening  or early morning before other wanderers were abroad.
Wuthering Heights,but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long.
Wuthering Heights,he didn   t pray for catherine   s soul to haunt him.
Wuthering Heights,time brought resignation  and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.
Wuthering Heights,he recalled her memory with ardent  tender love  and hopeful aspiring to the better world  where he doubted not she was gone.
Wuthering Heights,and he had earthly consolation and affections also.
Wuthering Heights,for a few days  i said  he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed  that coldness melted as fast as snow in april  and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot   s sceptre in his heart.
Wuthering Heights,it was named catherine  but he never called it the name in full  as he had never called the first catherine short  probably because heathcliff had a habit of doing so.
Wuthering Heights,the little one was always cathy  it formed to him a distinction from the mother  and yet a connection with her  and his attachment sprang from its relation to her  far more than from its being his own.
Wuthering Heights,i used to draw a comparison between him and hindley earnshaw  and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances.
Wuthering Heights,they had both been fond husbands  and were both attached to their children  and i could not see how they shouldn   t both have taken the same road  for good or evil.
Wuthering Heights,but  i thought in my mind  hindley  with apparently the stronger head  has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man.
Wuthering Heights,when his ship struck  the captain abandoned his post  and the crew  instead of trying to save her  rushed into riot and confusion  leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.
Wuthering Heights,linton  on the contrary  displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul  he trusted god  and god comforted him.
Wuthering Heights,one hoped  and the other despaired  they chose their own lots  and were righteously doomed to endure them.
Wuthering Heights,but you   ll not want to hear my moralising  mr. lockwood  you   ll judge  as well as i can  all these things  at least  you   ll think you will  and that   s the same.
Wuthering Heights,the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected  it followed fast on his sister   s  there were scarcely six months between them.
Wuthering Heights,we  at the grange  never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it  all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral.
Wuthering Heights,mr. kenneth came to announce the event to my master.
Wuthering Heights,well  nelly    said he  riding into the yard one morning  too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news     it   s yours and my turn to go into mourning at present.
Wuthering Heights,who   s given us the slip now  do you think        who    i asked in a flurry.
Wuthering Heights,why  guess    he returned  dismounting  and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door.
Wuthering Heights,and nip up the corner of your apron  i   m certain you   ll need it.
Wuthering Heights,not mr. heathcliff  surely    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,what  would you have tears for him    said the doctor.
Wuthering Heights,no  heathcliff   s a tough young fellow  he looks blooming to day.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve just seen him.
Wuthering Heights,he   s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.
Wuthering Heights,who is it  then  mr. kenneth    i repeated impatiently.
Wuthering Heights,hindley earnshaw  your old friend hindley    he replied     and my wicked gossip  though he   s been too wild for me this long while.
Wuthering Heights,there  i said we should draw water.
Wuthering Heights,but cheer up  he died true to his character  drunk as a lord.
Wuthering Heights,poor lad  i   m sorry  too.
Wuthering Heights,one can   t help missing an old companion  though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined  and has done me many a rascally turn.
Wuthering Heights,he   s barely twenty seven  it seems  that   s your own age  who would have thought you were born in one year     i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs. linton   s death  ancient associations lingered round my heart  i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation  desiring mr. kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master.
Wuthering Heights,i could not hinder myself from pondering on the question      had he had fair play    whatever i did  that idea would bother me  it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights  and assist in the last duties to the dead.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton was extremely reluctant to consent  but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay  and i said my old master and foster brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own.
Wuthering Heights,besides  i reminded him that the child hareton was his wife   s nephew  and  in the absence of nearer kin  he ought to act as its guardian  and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left  and look over the concerns of his brother in law.
Wuthering Heights,he was unfit for attending to such matters then  but he bid me speak to his lawyer  and at length permitted me to go.
Wuthering Heights,his lawyer had been earnshaw   s also  i called at the village  and asked him to accompany me.
Wuthering Heights,he shook his head  and advised that heathcliff should be let alone  affirming  if the truth were known  hareton would be found little else than a beggar.
Wuthering Heights,his father died in debt    he said     the whole property is mortgaged  and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor   s heart  that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.
Wuthering Heights,when i reached the heights  i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently  and joseph  who appeared in sufficient distress  expressed satisfaction at my presence.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted  but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral  if i chose.
Wuthering Heights,correctly    he remarked     that fool   s body should be buried at the cross roads  without ceremony of any kind.
Wuthering Heights,i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon  and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me  and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately  we broke in this morning  for we heard him snorting like a horse  and there he was  laid over the settle  flaying and scalping would not have wakened him.
Wuthering Heights,i sent for kenneth  and he came  but not till the beast had changed into carrion  he was both dead and cold  and stark  and so you   ll allow it was useless making more stir about him     the old servant confirmed this statement  but muttered      i   d rayther he   d goan hisseln for t    doctor  i sud ha    taen tent o    t    maister better nor him   and he warn   t deead when i left  naught o    t    soart     i insisted on the funeral being respectable.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff said i might have my own way there too  only  he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket.
Wuthering Heights,he maintained a hard  careless deportment  indicative of neither joy nor sorrow  if anything  it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed.
Wuthering Heights,i observed once  indeed  something like exultation in his aspect  it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house.
Wuthering Heights,he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner  and previous to following with hareton  he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered  with peculiar gusto     now  my bonny lad  you are mine  and we   ll see if one tree won   t grow as crooked as another  with the same wind to twist it    the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech  he played with heathcliff   s whiskers  and stroked his cheek  but i divined its meaning  and observed tartly     that boy must go back with me to thrushcross grange  sir.
Wuthering Heights,there is nothing in the world less yours than he is        does linton say so    he demanded.
Wuthering Heights,of course   he has ordered me to take him    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,well    said the scoundrel     we   ll not argue the subject now  but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one  so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own  if he attempt to remove it.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t engage to let hareton go undisputed  but i   ll be pretty sure to make the other come  remember to tell him.
Wuthering Heights,this hint was enough to bind our hands.
Wuthering Heights,i repeated its substance on my return  and edgar linton  little interested at the commencement  spoke no more of interfering.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not aware that he could have done it to any purpose  had he been ever so willing.
Wuthering Heights,the guest was now the master of wuthering heights  he held firm possession  and proved to the attorney   who  in his turn  proved it to mr. linton   that earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming  and he  heathcliff  was the mortgagee.
Wuthering Heights,in that manner hareton  who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood  was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father   s inveterate enemy  and lives in his own house as a servant  deprived of the advantage of wages  quite unable to right himself  because of his friendlessness  and his ignorance that he has been wronged.
Wuthering Heights,the twelve years  continued mrs. dean  following that dismal period were the happiest of my life  my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady   s trifling illnesses  which she had to experience in common with all children  rich and poor.
Wuthering Heights,for the rest  after the first six months  she grew like a larch  and could walk and talk too  in her own way  before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs. linton   s dust.
Wuthering Heights,she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house  a real beauty in face  with the earnshaws    handsome dark eyes  but the lintons    fair skin and small features  and yellow curling hair.
Wuthering Heights,her spirit was high  though not rough  and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections.
Wuthering Heights,that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother  still she did not resemble her  for she could be soft and mild as a dove  and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression  her anger was never furious  her love never fierce  it was deep and tender.
Wuthering Heights,however  it must be acknowledged  she had faults to foil her gifts.
Wuthering Heights,a propensity to be saucy was one  and a perverse will  that indulged children invariably acquire  whether they be good tempered or cross.
Wuthering Heights,if a servant chanced to vex her  it was always      i shall tell papa    and if he reproved her  even by a look  you would have thought it a heart breaking business  i don   t believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her.
Wuthering Heights,he took her education entirely on himself  and made it an amusement.
Wuthering Heights,fortunately  curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar  she learned rapidly and eagerly  and did honour to his teaching.
Wuthering Heights,till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton would take her with him a mile or so outside  on rare occasions  but he trusted her to no one else.
Wuthering Heights,gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears  the chapel  the only building she had approached or entered  except her own home.
Wuthering Heights,wuthering heights and mr. heathcliff did not exist for her  she was a perfect recluse  and  apparently  perfectly contented.
Wuthering Heights,sometimes  indeed  while surveying the country from her nursery window  she would observe        ellen  how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills  i wonder what lies on the other side   is it the sea        no  miss cathy    i would answer     it is hills again  just like these.
Wuthering Heights,and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them    she once asked.
Wuthering Heights,the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice  especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights  and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.
Wuthering Heights,i explained that they were bare masses of stone  with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.
Wuthering Heights,and why are they bright so long after it is evening here    she pursued.
Wuthering Heights,because they are a great deal higher up than we are    replied i     you could not climb them  they are too high and steep.
Wuthering Heights,in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us  and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the north east side        oh  you have been on them    she cried gleefully.
Wuthering Heights,then i can go  too  when i am a woman.
Wuthering Heights,has papa been  ellen        papa would tell you  miss    i answered  hastily     that they are not worth the trouble of visiting.
Wuthering Heights,the moors  where you ramble with him  are much nicer  and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world.
Wuthering Heights,but i know the park  and i don   t know those    she murmured to herself.
Wuthering Heights,and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point  my little pony minny shall take me some time.
Wuthering Heights,one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave  quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project  she teased mr. linton about it  and he promised she should have the journey when she got older.
Wuthering Heights,but miss catherine measured her age by months  and     now  am i old enough to go to penistone crags    was the constant question in her mouth.
Wuthering Heights,the road thither wound close by wuthering heights.
Wuthering Heights,edgar had not the heart to pass it  so she received as constantly the answer     not yet  love  not yet.
Wuthering Heights,i said mrs. heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband.
Wuthering Heights,her family were of a delicate constitution  she and edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.
Wuthering Heights,what her last illness was  i am not certain  i conjecture  they died of the same thing  a kind of fever  slow at its commencement  but incurable  and rapidly consuming life towards the close.
Wuthering Heights,she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months    indisposition under which she had suffered  and entreated him to come to her  if possible  for she had much to settle  and she wished to bid him adieu  and deliver linton safely into his hands.
Wuthering Heights,her hope was that linton might be left with him  as he had been with her  his father  she would fain convince herself  had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education.
Wuthering Heights,my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request  reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls  he flew to answer this  commending catherine to my peculiar vigilance  in his absence  with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park  even under my escort  he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.
Wuthering Heights,he was away three weeks.
Wuthering Heights,the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library  too sad for either reading or playing  in that quiet state she caused me little trouble  but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient  fretful weariness  and being too busy  and too old then  to run up and down amusing her  i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself.
Wuthering Heights,i used to send her on her travels round the grounds   now on foot  and now on a pony  indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.
Wuthering Heights,the summer shone in full prime  and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea  and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales.
Wuthering Heights,i did not fear her breaking bounds  because the gates were generally locked  and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone  if they had stood wide open.
Wuthering Heights,unluckily  my confidence proved misplaced.
Wuthering Heights,catherine came to me  one morning  at eight o   clock  and said she was that day an arabian merchant  going to cross the desert with his caravan  and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts  a horse  and three camels  personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.
Wuthering Heights,i got together good store of dainties  and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle  and she sprang up as gay as a fairy  sheltered by her wide brimmed hat and gauze veil from the july sun  and trotted off with a merry laugh  mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping  and come back early.
Wuthering Heights,the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.
Wuthering Heights,one traveller  the hound  being an old dog and fond of its ease  returned  but neither cathy  nor the pony  nor the two pointers were visible in any direction  i despatched emissaries down this path  and that path  and at last went wandering in search of her myself.
Wuthering Heights,there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation  on the borders of the grounds.
Wuthering Heights,i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.
Wuthering Heights,i saw her at morn    he replied     she would have me to cut her a hazel switch  and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder  where it is lowest  and galloped out of sight.
Wuthering Heights,you may guess how i felt at hearing this news.
Wuthering Heights,it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags.
Wuthering Heights,what will become of her    i ejaculated  pushing through a gap which the man was repairing  and making straight to the high road.
Wuthering Heights,i walked as if for a wager  mile after mile  till a turn brought me in view of the heights  but no catherine could i detect  far or near.
Wuthering Heights,the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr. heathcliff   s place  and that is four from the grange  so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them.
Wuthering Heights,and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them    i reflected     and been killed  or broken some of her bones    my suspense was truly painful  and  at first  it gave me delightful relief to observe  in hurrying by the farmhouse  charlie  the fiercest of the pointers  lying under a window  with swelled head and bleeding ear.
Wuthering Heights,i opened the wicket and ran to the door  knocking vehemently for admittance.
Wuthering Heights,a woman whom i knew  and who formerly lived at gimmerton  answered  she had been servant there since the death of mr. earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,ah    said she     you are come a seeking your little mistress  don   t be frightened.
Wuthering Heights,she   s here safe  but i   m glad it isn   t the master.
Wuthering Heights,he is not at home then  is he    i panted  quite breathless with quick walking and alarm.
Wuthering Heights,no  no    she replied     both he and joseph are off  and i think they won   t return this hour or more.
Wuthering Heights,step in and rest you a bit.
Wuthering Heights,i entered  and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth  rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother   s when a child.
Wuthering Heights,her hat was hung against the wall  and she seemed perfectly at home  laughing and chattering  in the best spirits imaginable  to hareton   now a great  strong lad of eighteen   who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment  comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.
Wuthering Heights,very well  miss    i exclaimed  concealing my joy under an angry countenance.
Wuthering Heights,this is your last ride  till papa comes back.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not trust you over the threshold again  you naughty  naughty girl        aha  ellen    she cried  gaily  jumping up and running to my side.
Wuthering Heights,i shall have a pretty story to tell to night  and so you   ve found me out.
Wuthering Heights,have you ever been here in your life before        put that hat on  and home at once    said i.    i   m dreadfully grieved at you  miss cathy  you   ve done extremely wrong  it   s no use pouting and crying  that won   t repay the trouble i   ve had  scouring the country after you.
Wuthering Heights,to think how mr. linton charged me to keep you in  and you stealing off so  it shows you are a cunning little fox  and nobody will put faith in you any more.
Wuthering Heights,what have i done    sobbed she  instantly checked.
Wuthering Heights,papa charged me nothing  he   ll not scold me  ellen   he   s never cross  like you        come  come    i repeated.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll tie the riband.
Wuthering Heights,now  let us have no petulance.
Wuthering Heights,oh  for shame  you thirteen years old  and such a baby     this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head  and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.
Wuthering Heights,nay    said the servant     don   t be hard on the bonny lass  mrs. dean.
Wuthering Heights,we made her stop  she   d fain have ridden forwards  afeard you should be uneasy.
Wuthering Heights,hareton offered to go with her  and i thought he should  it   s a wild road over the hills.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  during the discussion  stood with his hands in his pockets  too awkward to speak  though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.
Wuthering Heights,how long am i to wait    i continued  disregarding the woman   s interference.
Wuthering Heights,it will be dark in ten minutes.
Wuthering Heights,where is the pony  miss cathy  and where is phoenix  i shall leave you  unless you be quick  so please yourself.
Wuthering Heights,the pony is in the yard    she replied     and phoenix is shut in there.
Wuthering Heights,he   s bitten   and so is charlie.
Wuthering Heights,i was going to tell you all about it  but you are in a bad temper  and don   t deserve to hear.
Wuthering Heights,i picked up her hat  and approached to reinstate it  but perceiving that the people of the house took her part  she commenced capering round the room  and on my giving chase  ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture  rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.
Wuthering Heights,hareton and the woman laughed  and she joined them  and waxed more impertinent still  till i cried  in great irritation       well  miss cathy  if you were aware whose house this is you   d be glad enough to get out.
Wuthering Heights,it   s your father   s  isn   t it    said she  turning to hareton.
Wuthering Heights,nay    he replied  looking down  and blushing bashfully.
Wuthering Heights,he could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes  though they were just his own.
Wuthering Heights,whose then   your master   s    she asked.
Wuthering Heights,he coloured deeper  with a different feeling  muttered an oath  and turned away.
Wuthering Heights,who is his master    continued the tiresome girl  appealing to me.
Wuthering Heights,he talked about    our house     and    our folk.
Wuthering Heights,i thought he had been the owner   s son.
Wuthering Heights,and he never said miss  he should have done  shouldn   t he  if he   s a servant     hareton grew black as a thunder cloud at this childish speech.
Wuthering Heights,i silently shook my questioner  and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure.
Wuthering Heights,now  get my horse    she said  addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable boys at the grange.
Wuthering Heights,and you may come with me.
Wuthering Heights,i want to see where the goblin hunter rises in the marsh  and to hear about the fairishes  as you call them  but make haste  what   s the matter  get my horse  i say.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll see thee damned before i be thy servant    growled the lad.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll see me what    asked catherine in surprise.
Wuthering Heights,damned   thou saucy witch    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,there  miss cathy  you see you have got into pretty company    i interposed.
Wuthering Heights,nice words to be used to a young lady  pray don   t begin to dispute with him.
Wuthering Heights,come  let us seek for minny ourselves  and begone.
Wuthering Heights,but  ellen    cried she  staring fixed in astonishment     how dare he speak so to me  mustn   t he be made to do as i ask him  you wicked creature  i shall tell papa what you said.
Wuthering Heights,now  then     hareton did not appear to feel this threat  so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation.
Wuthering Heights,you bring the pony    she exclaimed  turning to the woman     and let my dog free this moment        softly  miss    answered the addressed.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll lose nothing by being civil.
Wuthering Heights,though mr. hareton  there  be not the master   s son  he   s your cousin  and i was never hired to serve you.
Wuthering Heights,he my cousin    cried cathy  with a scornful laugh.
Wuthering Heights,yes  indeed    responded her reprover.
Wuthering Heights,oh  ellen  don   t let them say such things    she pursued in great trouble.
Wuthering Heights,papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london  my cousin is a gentleman   s son.
Wuthering Heights,that my      she stopped  and wept outright  upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.
Wuthering Heights,hush  hush    i whispered     people can have many cousins and of all sorts  miss cathy  without being any the worse for it  only they needn   t keep their company  if they be disagreeable and bad.
Wuthering Heights,he   s not   he   s not my cousin  ellen    she went on  gathering fresh grief from reflection  and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.
Wuthering Heights,i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations  having no doubt of linton   s approaching arrival  communicated by the former  being reported to mr. heathcliff  and feeling as confident that catherine   s first thought on her father   s return would be to seek an explanation of the latter   s assertion concerning her rude bred kindred.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant  seemed moved by her distress  and  having fetched the pony round to the door  he took  to propitiate her  a fine crooked legged terrier whelp from the kennel  and putting it into her hand  bid her whist  for he meant nought.
Wuthering Heights,pausing in her lamentations  she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror  then burst forth anew.
Wuthering Heights,i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow  who was a well made  athletic youth  good looking in features  and stout and healthy  but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game.
Wuthering Heights,still  i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.
Wuthering Heights,good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds  to be sure  whose rankness far over topped their neglected growth  yet  notwithstanding  evidence of a wealthy soil  that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  i believe  had not treated him physically ill  thanks to his fearless nature  which offered no temptation to that course of oppression  he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill treatment  in heathcliff   s judgment.
Wuthering Heights,he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute  he was never taught to read or write  never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper  never led a single step towards virtue  or guarded by a single precept against vice.
Wuthering Heights,and from what i heard  joseph contributed much to his deterioration  by a narrow minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him  as a boy  because he was the head of the old family.
Wuthering Heights,and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine earnshaw and heathcliff  when children  of putting the master past his patience  and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their    offald ways    so at present he laid the whole burden of hareton   s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property.
Wuthering Heights,if the lad swore  he wouldn   t correct him  nor however culpably he behaved.
Wuthering Heights,it gave joseph satisfaction  apparently  to watch him go the worst lengths  he allowed that the lad was ruined  that his soul was abandoned to perdition  but then he reflected that heathcliff must answer for it.
Wuthering Heights,hareton   s blood would be required at his hands  and there lay immense consolation in that thought.
Wuthering Heights,joseph had instilled into him a pride of name  and of his lineage  he would  had he dared  have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights  but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition  and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights  i only speak from hearsay  for i saw little.
Wuthering Heights,the villagers affirmed mr. heathcliff was near  and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants  but the house  inside  had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management  and the scenes of riot common in hindley   s time were not now enacted within its walls.
Wuthering Heights,the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people  good or bad  and he is yet.
Wuthering Heights,this  however  is not making progress with my story.
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy rejected the peace offering of the terrier  and demanded her own dogs  charlie and phoenix.
Wuthering Heights,they came limping and hanging their heads  and we set out for home  sadly out of sorts  every one of us.
Wuthering Heights,i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day  except that  as i supposed  the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags  and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse  when hareton happened to issue forth  attended by some canine followers  who attacked her train.
Wuthering Heights,they had a smart battle  before their owners could separate them  that formed an introduction.
Wuthering Heights,catherine told hareton who she was  and where she was going  and asked him to show her the way  finally  beguiling him to accompany her.
Wuthering Heights,he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave  and twenty other queer places.
Wuthering Heights,but  being in disgrace  i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.
Wuthering Heights,i could gather  however  that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant  and heathcliff   s housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin.
Wuthering Heights,then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart  she who was always    love    and    darling    and    queen    and    angel    with everybody at the grange  to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger  she did not comprehend it  and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.
Wuthering Heights,i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights  and how sorry he would be to find she had been there  but i insisted most on the fact  that if she revealed my negligence of his orders  he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave  and cathy couldn   t bear that prospect  she pledged her word  and kept it for my sake.
Wuthering Heights,after all  she was a sweet little girl.
Wuthering Heights, a letter  edged with black  announced the day of my master   s return.
Wuthering Heights,isabella was dead  and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter  and arrange a room  and other accommodations  for his youthful nephew.
Wuthering Heights,catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back  and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her    real   cousin.
Wuthering Heights,the evening of their expected arrival came.
Wuthering Heights,since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs  and now attired in her new black frock   poor thing  her aunt   s death impressed her with no definite sorrow   she obliged me  by constant worrying  to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.
Wuthering Heights,linton is just six months younger than i am    she chattered  as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf  under shadow of the trees.
Wuthering Heights,how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow  aunt isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair  it was lighter than mine   more flaxen  and quite as fine.
Wuthering Heights,i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box  and i   ve often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i am happy   and papa  dear  dear papa  come  ellen  let us run  come  run.
Wuthering Heights,she ran  and returned and ran again  many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate  and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path  and tried to wait patiently  but that was impossible  she couldn   t be still a minute.
Wuthering Heights,how long they are    she exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,ah  i see some dust on the road   they are coming  no  when will they be here  may we not go a little way   half a mile  ellen  only just half a mile  do say yes  to that clump of birches at the turn     i refused staunchly.
Wuthering Heights,at length her suspense was ended  the travelling carriage rolled in sight.
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her father   s face looking from the window.
Wuthering Heights,he descended  nearly as eager as herself  and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.
Wuthering Heights,while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton.
Wuthering Heights,he was asleep in a corner  wrapped in a warm  fur lined cloak  as if it had been winter.
Wuthering Heights,a pale  delicate  effeminate boy  who might have been taken for my master   s younger brother  so strong was the resemblance  but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had.
Wuthering Heights,the latter saw me looking  and having shaken hands  advised me to close the door  and leave him undisturbed  for the journey had fatigued him.
Wuthering Heights,cathy would fain have taken one glance  but her father told her to come  and they walked together up the park  while i hastened before to prepare the servants.
Wuthering Heights,now  darling    said mr. linton  addressing his daughter  as they halted at the bottom of the front steps     your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are  and he has lost his mother  remember  a very short time since  therefore  don   t expect him to play and run about with you directly.
Wuthering Heights,and don   t harass him much by talking  let him be quiet this evening  at least  will you        yes  yes  papa    answered catherine     but i do want to see him  and he hasn   t once looked out.
Wuthering Heights,the carriage stopped  and the sleeper being roused  was lifted to the ground by his uncle.
Wuthering Heights,this is your cousin cathy  linton    he said  putting their little hands together.
Wuthering Heights,she   s fond of you already  and mind you don   t grieve her by crying to night.
Wuthering Heights,try to be cheerful now  the travelling is at an end  and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.
Wuthering Heights,let me go to bed  then    answered the boy  shrinking from catherine   s salute  and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.
Wuthering Heights,come  come  there   s a good child    i whispered  leading him in.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll make her weep too   see how sorry she is for you     i do not know whether it was sorrow for him  but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself  and returned to her father.
Wuthering Heights,all three entered  and mounted to the library  where tea was laid ready.
Wuthering Heights,i proceeded to remove linton   s cap and mantle  and placed him on a chair by the table  but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.
Wuthering Heights,my master inquired what was the matter.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t sit on a chair    sobbed the boy.
Wuthering Heights,go to the sofa  then  and ellen shall bring you some tea    answered his uncle patiently.
Wuthering Heights,he had been greatly tried  during the journey  i felt convinced  by his fretful ailing charge.
Wuthering Heights,linton slowly trailed himself off  and lay down.
Wuthering Heights,cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.
Wuthering Heights,at first she sat silent  but that could not last  she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin  as she would have him to be  and she commenced stroking his curls  and kissing his cheek  and offering him tea in her saucer  like a baby.
Wuthering Heights,this pleased him  for he was not much better  he dried his eyes  and lightened into a faint smile.
Wuthering Heights,oh  he   ll do very well    said the master to me  after watching them a minute.
Wuthering Heights,very well  if we can keep him  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon  and by wishing for strength he   ll gain it.
Wuthering Heights,ay  if we can keep him    i mused to myself  and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that.
Wuthering Heights,and then  i thought  how ever will that weakling live at wuthering heights  between his father and hareton  what playmates and instructors they   ll be.
Wuthering Heights,our doubts were presently decided   even earlier than i expected.
Wuthering Heights,i had just taken the children upstairs  after tea was finished  and seen linton asleep   he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case   i had come down  and was standing by the table in the hall  lighting a bedroom candle for mr. edgar  when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr. heathcliff   s servant joseph was at the door  and wished to speak with the master.
Wuthering Heights,i shall ask him what he wants first    i said  in considerable trepidation.
Wuthering Heights,a very unlikely hour to be troubling people  and the instant they have returned from a long journey.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t think the master can see him.
Wuthering Heights,joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words  and now presented himself in the hall.
Wuthering Heights,he was donned in his sunday garments  with his most sanctimonious and sourest face  and  holding his hat in one hand  and his stick in the other  he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.
Wuthering Heights,good evening  joseph    i said  coldly.
Wuthering Heights,what business brings you here to night        it   s maister linton i mun spake to    he answered  waving me disdainfully aside.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton is going to bed  unless you have something particular to say  i   m sure he won   t hear it now    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,you had better sit down in there  and entrust your message to me.
Wuthering Heights,which is his rahm    pursued the fellow  surveying the range of closed doors.
Wuthering Heights,i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation  so very reluctantly i went up to the library  and announced the unseasonable visitor  advising that he should be dismissed till next day.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton had no time to empower me to do so  for joseph mounted close at my heels  and  pushing into the apartment  planted himself at the far side of the table  with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick  and began in an elevated tone  as if anticipating opposition        hathecliff has sent me for his lad  and i munn   t goa back    bout him.
Wuthering Heights,edgar linton was silent a minute  an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features  he would have pitied the child on his own account  but  recalling isabella   s hopes and fears  and anxious wishes for her son  and her commendations of him to his care  he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up  and searched in his heart how it might be avoided.
Wuthering Heights,no plan offered itself  the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory  there was nothing left but to resign him.
Wuthering Heights,however  he was not going to rouse him from his sleep.
Wuthering Heights,tell mr. heathcliff    he answered calmly     that his son shall come to wuthering heights to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,he is in bed  and too tired to go the distance now.
Wuthering Heights,you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired him to remain under my guardianship  and  at present  his health is very precarious.
Wuthering Heights,noa    said joseph  giving a thud with his prop on the floor  and assuming an authoritative air.
Wuthering Heights,noa  that means naught.
Wuthering Heights,hathecliff maks noa    count o    t    mother  nor ye norther  but he   ll hev his lad  und i mun tak    him   soa now ye knaw        you shall not to night    answered linton decisively.
Wuthering Heights,walk down stairs at once  and repeat to your master what i have said.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  show him down.
Wuthering Heights,go       and  aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm  he rid the room of him and closed the door.
Wuthering Heights,varrah weell    shouted joseph  as he slowly drew off.
Wuthering Heights,to morn  he   s come hisseln  and thrust him out  if ye darr     to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled  mr. linton commissioned me to take the boy home early  on catherine   s pony  and  said he      as we shall now have no influence over his destiny  good or bad  you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter  she cannot associate with him hereafter  and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity  lest she should be restless  and anxious to visit the heights.
Wuthering Heights,merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly  and he has been obliged to leave us.
Wuthering Heights,linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o   clock  and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling  but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father  mr. heathcliff  who wished to see him so much  he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.
Wuthering Heights,my father    he cried  in strange perplexity.
Wuthering Heights,mamma never told me i had a father.
Wuthering Heights,where does he live  i   d rather stay with uncle.
Wuthering Heights,he lives a little distance from the grange    i replied     just beyond those hills  not so far  but you may walk over here when you get hearty.
Wuthering Heights,and you should be glad to go home  and to see him.
Wuthering Heights,you must try to love him  as you did your mother  and then he will love you.
Wuthering Heights,but why have i not heard of him before    asked linton.
Wuthering Heights,why didn   t mamma and he live together  as other people do        he had business to keep him in the north    i answered     and your mother   s health required her to reside in the south.
Wuthering Heights,and why didn   t mamma speak to me about him    persevered the child.
Wuthering Heights,she often talked of uncle  and i learnt to love him long ago.
Wuthering Heights,how am i to love papa  i don   t know him.
Wuthering Heights,oh  all children love their parents    i said.
Wuthering Heights,your mother  perhaps  thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.
Wuthering Heights,let us make haste.
Wuthering Heights,an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour   s more sleep.
Wuthering Heights,is she to go with us    he demanded     the little girl i saw yesterday        not now    replied i.
Wuthering Heights,is uncle    he continued.
Wuthering Heights,no  i shall be your companion there    i said.
Wuthering Heights,linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.
Wuthering Heights,i won   t go without uncle    he cried at length     i can   t tell where you mean to take me.
Wuthering Heights,i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father  still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing  and i had to call for my master   s assistance in coaxing him out of bed.
Wuthering Heights,the poor thing was finally got off  with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short  that mr. edgar and cathy would visit him  and other promises  equally ill founded  which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.
Wuthering Heights,the pure heather scented air  the bright sunshine  and the gentle canter of minny  relieved his despondency after a while.
Wuthering Heights,he began to put questions concerning his new home  and its inhabitants  with greater interest and liveliness.
Wuthering Heights,is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange    he inquired  turning to take a last glance into the valley  whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.
Wuthering Heights,it is not so buried in trees    i replied     and it is not quite so large  but you can see the country beautifully all round  and the air is healthier for you   fresher and drier.
Wuthering Heights,you will  perhaps  think the building old and dark at first  though it is a respectable house  the next best in the neighbourhood.
Wuthering Heights,and you will have such nice rambles on the moors.
Wuthering Heights,hareton earnshaw   that is  miss cathy   s other cousin  and so yours in a manner   will show you all the sweetest spots  and you can bring a book in fine weather  and make a green hollow your study  and  now and then  your uncle may join you in a walk  he does  frequently  walk out on the hills.
Wuthering Heights,and what is my father like    he asked.
Wuthering Heights,is he as young and handsome as uncle        he   s as young    said i     but he has black hair and eyes  and looks sterner  and he is taller and bigger altogether.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first  perhaps  because it is not his way  still  mind you  be frank and cordial with him  and naturally he   ll be fonder of you than any uncle  for you are his own.
Wuthering Heights,black hair and eyes    mused linton.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t fancy him.
Wuthering Heights,then i am not like him  am i        not much    i answered  not a morsel  i thought  surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion  and his large languid eyes   his mother   s eyes  save that  unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment  they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.
Wuthering Heights,how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me    he murmured.
Wuthering Heights,has he ever seen me  if he has  i must have been a baby.
Wuthering Heights,i remember not a single thing about him        why  master linton    said i     three hundred miles is a great distance  and ten years seem very different in length to a grown up person compared with what they do to you.
Wuthering Heights,it is probable mr. heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer  but never found a convenient opportunity  and now it is too late.
Wuthering Heights,don   t trouble him with questions on the subject  it will disturb him  for no good.
Wuthering Heights,the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride  till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate.
Wuthering Heights,i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance.
Wuthering Heights,he surveyed the carved front and low browed lattices  the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs  with solemn intentness  and then shook his head  his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.
Wuthering Heights,but he had sense to postpone complaining  there might be compensation within.
Wuthering Heights,before he dismounted  i went and opened the door.
Wuthering Heights,it was half past six  the family had just finished breakfast  the servant was clearing and wiping down the table.
Wuthering Heights,joseph stood by his master   s chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse  and hareton was preparing for the hayfield.
Wuthering Heights,hallo  nelly    said mr. heathcliff  when he saw me.
Wuthering Heights,i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve brought it  have you  let us see what we can make of it.
Wuthering Heights,he got up and strode to the door  hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity.
Wuthering Heights,poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.
Wuthering Heights,sure ly    said joseph after a grave inspection     he   s swopped wi    ye  maister  an    yon   s his lass     heathcliff  having stared his son into an ague of confusion  uttered a scornful laugh.
Wuthering Heights,god  what a beauty  what a lovely  charming thing    he exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,hav   n   t they reared it on snails and sour milk  nelly  oh  damn my soul  but that   s worse than i expected   and the devil knows i was not sanguine     i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down  and enter.
Wuthering Heights,he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father   s speech  or whether it were intended for him  indeed  he was not yet certain that the grim  sneering stranger was his father.
Wuthering Heights,but he clung to me with growing trepidation  and on mr. heathcliff   s taking a seat and bidding him    come hither   he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.
Wuthering Heights,tut  tut    said heathcliff  stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees  and then holding up his head by the chin.
Wuthering Heights,none of that nonsense  we   re not going to hurt thee  linton   isn   t that thy name  thou art thy mother   s child  entirely  where is my share in thee  puling chicken     he took off the boy   s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls  felt his slender arms and his small fingers  during which examination linton ceased crying  and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.
Wuthering Heights,do you know me    asked heathcliff  having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble.
Wuthering Heights,no    said linton  with a gaze of vacant fear.
Wuthering Heights,you   ve heard of me  i daresay        no    he replied again.
Wuthering Heights,no  what a shame of your mother  never to waken your filial regard for me  you are my son  then  i   ll tell you  and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.
Wuthering Heights,now  don   t wince  and colour up  though it is something to see you have not white blood.
Wuthering Heights,be a good lad  and i   ll do for you.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  if you be tired you may sit down  if not  get home again.
Wuthering Heights,i guess you   ll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange  and this thing won   t be settled while you linger about it.
Wuthering Heights,well    replied i     i hope you   ll be kind to the boy  mr. heathcliff  or you   ll not keep him long  and he   s all you have akin in the wide world  that you will ever know   remember.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll be very kind to him  you needn   t fear    he said  laughing.
Wuthering Heights,only nobody else must be kind to him  i   m jealous of monopolising his affection.
Wuthering Heights,and  to begin my kindness  joseph  bring the lad some breakfast.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  you infernal calf  begone to your work.
Wuthering Heights,yes  nell    he added  when they had departed     my son is prospective owner of your place  and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor.
Wuthering Heights,besides  he   s mine  and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates  my child hiring their children to till their fathers    lands for wages.
Wuthering Heights,that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp  i despise him for himself  and hate him for the memories he revives  but that consideration is sufficient  he   s as safe with me  and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own.
Wuthering Heights,i have a room upstairs  furnished for him in handsome style  i   ve engaged a tutor  also  to come three times a week  from twenty miles    distance  to teach him what he pleases to learn.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve ordered hareton to obey him  and in fact i   ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him  above his associates.
Wuthering Heights,i do regret  however  that he so little deserves the trouble  if i wished any blessing in the world  it was to find him a worthy object of pride  and i   m bitterly disappointed with the whey faced  whining wretch     while he was speaking  joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge  and placed it before linton  who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion  and affirmed he could not eat it.
Wuthering Heights,i saw the old man servant shared largely in his master   s scorn of the child  though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart  because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.
Wuthering Heights,cannot ate it    repeated he  peering in linton   s face  and subduing his voice to a whisper  for fear of being overheard.
Wuthering Heights,but maister hareton nivir ate naught else  when he wer a little    un  and what wer gooid eneugh for him   s gooid eneugh for ye  i   s rayther think        i sha   n   t eat it    answered linton  snappishly.
Wuthering Heights,take it away.
Wuthering Heights,joseph snatched up the food indignantly  and brought it to us.
Wuthering Heights,is there aught ails th    victuals    he asked  thrusting the tray under heathcliff   s nose.
Wuthering Heights,what should ail them    he said.
Wuthering Heights,wah    answered joseph     yon dainty chap says he cannut ate    em.
Wuthering Heights,but i guess it   s raight  his mother wer just soa   we wer a   most too mucky to sow t    corn for makking her breead.
Wuthering Heights,don   t mention his mother to me    said the master  angrily.
Wuthering Heights,get him something that he can eat  that   s all.
Wuthering Heights,what is his usual food  nelly     i suggested boiled milk or tea  and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some.
Wuthering Heights,come  i reflected  his father   s selfishness may contribute to his comfort.
Wuthering Heights,he perceives his delicate constitution  and the necessity of treating him tolerably.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll console mr. edgar by acquainting him with the turn heathcliff   s humour has taken.
Wuthering Heights,having no excuse for lingering longer  i slipped out  while linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep dog.
Wuthering Heights,but he was too much on the alert to be cheated  as i closed the door  i heard a cry  and a frantic repetition of the words        don   t leave me  i   ll not stay here  i   ll not stay here     then the latch was raised and fell  they did not suffer him to come forth.
Wuthering Heights,i mounted minny  and urged her to a trot  and so my brief guardianship ended.
Wuthering Heights,we had sad work with little cathy that day  she rose in high glee  eager to join her cousin  and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that edgar himself was obliged to soothe her  by affirming he should come back soon  he added  however     if i can get him    and there were no hopes of that.
Wuthering Heights,this promise poorly pacified her  but time was more potent  and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when linton would return  before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.
Wuthering Heights,when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights  in paying business visits to gimmerton  i used to ask how the young master got on  for he lived almost as secluded as catherine herself  and was never to be seen.
Wuthering Heights,i could gather from her that he continued in weak health  and was a tiresome inmate.
Wuthering Heights,she said mr. heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse  though he took some trouble to conceal it  he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice  and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.
Wuthering Heights,there seldom passed much talk between them  linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour  or else lay in bed all day  for he was constantly getting coughs  and colds  and aches  and pains of some sort.
Wuthering Heights,and i never knew such a faint hearted creature    added the woman     nor one so careful of hisseln.
Wuthering Heights,he will go on  if i leave the window open a bit late in the evening.
Wuthering Heights,oh  it   s killing  a breath of night air  and he must have a fire in the middle of summer  and joseph   s bacca pipe is poison  and he must always have sweets and dainties  and always milk  milk for ever   heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter  and there he   ll sit  wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire  with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at  and if hareton  for pity  comes to amuse him   hareton is not bad natured  though he   s rough   they   re sure to part  one swearing and the other crying.
Wuthering Heights,i believe the master would relish earnshaw   s thrashing him to a mummy  if he were not his son  and i   m certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors  if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln.
Wuthering Heights,but then he won   t go into danger of temptation  he never enters the parlour  and should linton show those ways in the house where he is  he sends him upstairs directly.
Wuthering Heights,i divined  from this account  that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young heathcliff selfish and disagreeable  if he were not so originally  and my interest in him  consequently  decayed  though still i was moved with a sense of grief at his lot  and a wish that he had been left with us.
Wuthering Heights,mr. edgar encouraged me to gain information  he thought a great deal about him  i fancy  and would have run some risk to see him  and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village  she said he had only been twice  on horseback  accompanying his father  and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards.
Wuthering Heights,that housekeeper left  if i recollect rightly  two years after he came  and another  whom i did not know  was her successor  she lives there still.
Wuthering Heights,time wore on at the grange in its former pleasant way till miss cathy reached sixteen.
Wuthering Heights,on the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing  because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress   s death.
Wuthering Heights,her father invariably spent that day alone in the library  and walked  at dusk  as far as gimmerton kirkyard  where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.
Wuthering Heights,therefore catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.
Wuthering Heights,this twentieth of march was a beautiful spring day  and when her father had retired  my young lady came down dressed for going out  and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me  mr. linton had given her leave  if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.
Wuthering Heights,so make haste  ellen    she cried.
Wuthering Heights,i know where i wish to go  where a colony of moor game are settled  i want to see whether they have made their nests yet.
Wuthering Heights,that must be a good distance up    i answered     they don   t breed on the edge of the moor.
Wuthering Heights,no  it   s not    she said.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve gone very near with papa.
Wuthering Heights,i put on my bonnet and sallied out  thinking nothing more of the matter.
Wuthering Heights,she bounded before me  and returned to my side  and was off again like a young greyhound  and  at first  i found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near  and enjoying the sweet  warm sunshine  and watching her  my pet and my delight  with her golden ringlets flying loose behind  and her bright cheek  as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose  and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.
Wuthering Heights,she was a happy creature  and an angel  in those days.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a pity she could not be content.
Wuthering Heights,well    said i     where are your moor game  miss cathy  we should be at them  the grange park fence is a great way off now.
Wuthering Heights,oh  a little further   only a little further  ellen    was her answer  continually.
Wuthering Heights,climb to that hillock  pass that bank  and by the time you reach the other side i shall have raised the birds.
Wuthering Heights,but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass  that  at length  i began to be weary  and told her we must halt  and retrace our steps.
Wuthering Heights,i shouted to her  as she had outstripped me a long way  she either did not hear or did not regard  for she still sprang on  and i was compelled to follow.
Wuthering Heights,finally  she dived into a hollow  and before i came in sight of her again  she was two miles nearer wuthering heights than her own home  and i beheld a couple of persons arrest her  one of whom i felt convinced was mr. heathcliff himself.
Wuthering Heights,cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering  or  at least  hunting out the nests of the grouse.
Wuthering Heights,the heights were heathcliff   s land  and he was reproving the poacher.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve neither taken any nor found any    she said  as i toiled to them  expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t mean to take them  but papa told me there were quantities up here  and i wished to see the eggs.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff glanced at me with an ill meaning smile  expressing his acquaintance with the party  and  consequently  his malevolence towards it  and demanded who    papa   was      mr. linton of thrushcross grange    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,i thought you did not know me  or you wouldn   t have spoken in that way.
Wuthering Heights,you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected  then    he said  sarcastically.
Wuthering Heights,and what are you    inquired catherine  gazing curiously on the speaker.
Wuthering Heights,that man i   ve seen before.
Wuthering Heights,is he your son     she pointed to hareton  the other individual  who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age  he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy    i interrupted     it will be three hours instead of one that we are out  presently.
Wuthering Heights,we really must go back.
Wuthering Heights,no  that man is not my son    answered heathcliff  pushing me aside.
Wuthering Heights,but i have one  and you have seen him before too  and  though your nurse is in a hurry  i think both you and she would be the better for a little rest.
Wuthering Heights,will you just turn this nab of heath  and walk into my house  you   ll get home earlier for the ease  and you shall receive a kind welcome.
Wuthering Heights,i whispered catherine that she mustn   t  on any account  accede to the proposal  it was entirely out of the question.
Wuthering Heights,why    she asked  aloud.
Wuthering Heights,i   m tired of running  and the ground is dewy  i can   t sit here.
Wuthering Heights,let us go  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,besides  he says i have seen his son.
Wuthering Heights,he   s mistaken  i think  but i guess where he lives  at the farmhouse i visited in coming from penistone crags.
Wuthering Heights,don   t you        i do.
Wuthering Heights,come  nelly  hold your tongue   it will be a treat for her to look in on us.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  get forwards with the lass.
Wuthering Heights,you shall walk with me  nelly.
Wuthering Heights,no  she   s not going to any such place    i cried  struggling to release my arm  which he had seized  but she was almost at the door stones already  scampering round the brow at full speed.
Wuthering Heights,her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her  he shied off by the road side  and vanished.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  it   s very wrong    i continued     you know you mean no good.
Wuthering Heights,and there she   ll see linton  and all will be told as soon as ever we return  and i shall have the blame.
Wuthering Heights,i want her to see linton    he answered     he   s looking better these few days  it   s not often he   s fit to be seen.
Wuthering Heights,and we   ll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret  where is the harm of it        the harm of it is  that her father would hate me if he found i suffered her to enter your house  and i am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,my design is as honest as possible.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll inform you of its whole scope    he said.
Wuthering Heights,that the two cousins may fall in love  and get married.
Wuthering Heights,i   m acting generously to your master  his young chit has no expectations  and should she second my wishes she   ll be provided for at once as joint successor with linton.
Wuthering Heights,if linton died    i answered     and his life is quite uncertain  catherine would be the heir.
Wuthering Heights,no  she would not    he said.
Wuthering Heights,there is no clause in the will to secure it so  his property would go to me  but  to prevent disputes  i desire their union  and am resolved to bring it about.
Wuthering Heights,and i   m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again    i returned  as we reached the gate  where miss cathy waited our coming.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff bade me be quiet  and  preceding us up the path  hastened to open the door.
Wuthering Heights,my young lady gave him several looks  as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him  but now he smiled when he met her eye  and softened his voice in addressing her  and i was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury.
Wuthering Heights,linton stood on the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,he had been out walking in the fields  for his cap was on  and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry shoes.
Wuthering Heights,he had grown tall of his age  still wanting some months of sixteen.
Wuthering Heights,his features were pretty yet  and his eye and complexion brighter than i remembered them  though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.
Wuthering Heights,now  who is that    asked mr. heathcliff  turning to cathy.
Wuthering Heights,can you tell        your son    she said  having doubtfully surveyed  first one and then the other.
Wuthering Heights,yes  yes    answered he     but is this the only time you have beheld him  think  ah  you have a short memory.
Wuthering Heights,linton  don   t you recall your cousin  that you used to tease us so with wishing to see        what  linton    cried cathy  kindling into joyful surprise at the name.
Wuthering Heights,is that little linton  he   s taller than i am  are you linton     the youth stepped forward  and acknowledged himself  she kissed him fervently  and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each.
Wuthering Heights,catherine had reached her full height  her figure was both plump and slender  elastic as steel  and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits.
Wuthering Heights,linton   s looks and movements were very languid  and his form extremely slight  but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects  and rendered him not unpleasing.
Wuthering Heights,after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him  his cousin went to mr. heathcliff  who lingered by the door  dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without  pretending  that is  to observe the latter  and really noting the former alone.
Wuthering Heights,and you are my uncle  then    she cried  reaching up to salute him.
Wuthering Heights,i thought i liked you  though you were cross at first.
Wuthering Heights,why don   t you visit at the grange with linton  to live all these years such close neighbours  and never see us  is odd  what have you done so for        i visited it once or twice too often before you were born    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,there   damn it  if you have any kisses to spare  give them to linton  they are thrown away on me.
Wuthering Heights,naughty ellen    exclaimed catherine  flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses.
Wuthering Heights,wicked ellen  to try to hinder me from entering.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ll take this walk every morning in future  may i  uncle  and sometimes bring papa.
Wuthering Heights,won   t you be glad to see us        of course    replied the uncle  with a hardly suppressed grimace  resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.
Wuthering Heights,but stay    he continued  turning towards the young lady.
Wuthering Heights,now i think of it  i   d better tell you.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton has a prejudice against me  we quarrelled at one time of our lives  with unchristian ferocity  and  if you mention coming here to him  he   ll put a veto on your visits altogether.
Wuthering Heights,therefore  you must not mention it  unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter  you may come  if you will  but you must not mention it.
Wuthering Heights,why did you quarrel    asked catherine  considerably crestfallen.
Wuthering Heights,he thought me too poor to wed his sister    answered heathcliff     and was grieved that i got her  his pride was hurt  and he   ll never forgive it.
Wuthering Heights,that   s wrong    said the young lady     some time i   ll tell him so.
Wuthering Heights,but linton and i have no share in your quarrel.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not come here  then  he shall come to the grange.
Wuthering Heights,it will be too far for me    murmured her cousin     to walk four miles would kill me.
Wuthering Heights,no  come here  miss catherine  now and then  not every morning  but once or twice a week.
Wuthering Heights,the father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.
Wuthering Heights,i am afraid  nelly  i shall lose my labour    he muttered to me.
Wuthering Heights,miss catherine  as the ninny calls her  will discover his value  and send him to the devil.
Wuthering Heights,now  if it had been hareton    do you know that  twenty times a day  i covet hareton  with all his degradation  i   d have loved the lad had he been some one else.
Wuthering Heights,but i think he   s safe from her love.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll pit him against that paltry creature  unless it bestir itself briskly.
Wuthering Heights,we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.
Wuthering Heights,oh  confound the vapid thing  he   s absorbed in drying his feet  and never looks at her.
Wuthering Heights,linton        yes  father    answered the boy.
Wuthering Heights,have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about  not even a rabbit or a weasel   s nest  take her into the garden  before you change your shoes  and into the stable to see your horse.
Wuthering Heights,wouldn   t you rather sit here    asked linton  addressing cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t know    she replied  casting a longing look to the door  and evidently eager to be active.
Wuthering Heights,he kept his seat  and shrank closer to the fire.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff rose  and went into the kitchen  and from thence to the yard  calling out for hareton.
Wuthering Heights,hareton responded  and presently the two re entered.
Wuthering Heights,the young man had been washing himself  as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   ll ask you  uncle    cried miss cathy  recollecting the housekeeper   s assertion.
Wuthering Heights,that is not my cousin  is he        yes    he replied     your mother   s nephew.
Wuthering Heights,don   t you like him     catherine looked queer.
Wuthering Heights,is he not a handsome lad    he continued.
Wuthering Heights,the uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe  and whispered a sentence in heathcliff   s ear.
Wuthering Heights,he laughed  hareton darkened  i perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights  and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority.
Wuthering Heights,but his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming        you   ll be the favourite among us  hareton  she says you are a   what was it  well  something very flattering.
Wuthering Heights,here  you go with her round the farm.
Wuthering Heights,and behave like a gentleman  mind  don   t use any bad words  and don   t stare when the young lady is not looking at you  and be ready to hide your face when she is  and  when you speak  say your words slowly  and keep your hands out of your pockets.
Wuthering Heights,be off  and entertain her as nicely as you can.
Wuthering Heights,he watched the couple walking past the window.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion.
Wuthering Heights,he seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger   s and an artist   s interest.
Wuthering Heights,catherine took a sly look at him  expressing small admiration.
Wuthering Heights,she then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself  and tripped merrily on  lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve tied his tongue    observed heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll not venture a single syllable all the time  nelly  you recollect me at his age   nay  some years younger.
Wuthering Heights,did i ever look so stupid  so    gaumless     as joseph calls it        worse    i replied     because more sullen with it.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve a pleasure in him    he continued  reflecting aloud.
Wuthering Heights,he has satisfied my expectations.
Wuthering Heights,if he were a born fool i should not enjoy it half so much.
Wuthering Heights,but he   s no fool  and i can sympathise with all his feelings  having felt them myself.
Wuthering Heights,i know what he suffers now  for instance  exactly  it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer  though.
Wuthering Heights,and he   ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me  and lower  for he takes a pride in his brutishness.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve taught him to scorn everything extra animal as silly and weak.
Wuthering Heights,don   t you think hindley would be proud of his son  if he could see him  almost as proud as i am of mine.
Wuthering Heights,but there   s this difference  one is gold put to the use of paving stones  and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver.
Wuthering Heights,mine has nothing valuable about it  yet i shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.
Wuthering Heights,his had first rate qualities  and they are lost  rendered worse than unavailing.
Wuthering Heights,i have nothing to regret  he would have more than any  but i  are aware of.
Wuthering Heights,and the best of it is  hareton is damnably fond of me  you   ll own that i   ve outmatched hindley there.
Wuthering Heights,if the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring   s wrongs  i should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again  indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world     heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.
Wuthering Heights,i made no reply  because i saw that he expected none.
Wuthering Heights,meantime  our young companion  who sat too removed from us to hear what was said  began to evince symptoms of uneasiness  probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of catherine   s society for fear of a little fatigue.
Wuthering Heights,his father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window  and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap.
Wuthering Heights,get up  you idle boy    he exclaimed  with assumed heartiness.
Wuthering Heights,away after them  they are just at the corner  by the stand of hives.
Wuthering Heights,linton gathered his energies  and left the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,the lattice was open  and  as he stepped out  i heard cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door  hareton stared up  and scratched his head like a true clown.
Wuthering Heights,it   s some damnable writing    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot read it.
Wuthering Heights,can   t read it    cried catherine     i can read it  it   s english.
Wuthering Heights,but i want to know why it is there.
Wuthering Heights,linton giggled  the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.
Wuthering Heights,he does not know his letters    he said to his cousin.
Wuthering Heights,could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce        is he all as he should be    asked miss cathy  seriously     or is he simple  not right  i   ve questioned him twice now  and each time he looked so stupid i think he does not understand me.
Wuthering Heights,i can hardly understand him  i   m sure     linton repeated his laugh  and glanced at hareton tauntingly  who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.
Wuthering Heights,there   s nothing the matter but laziness  is there  earnshaw    he said.
Wuthering Heights,my cousin fancies you are an idiot.
Wuthering Heights,there you experience the consequence of scorning    book larning     as you would say.
Wuthering Heights,have you noticed  catherine  his frightful yorkshire pronunciation        why  where the devil is the use on   t    growled hareton  more ready in answering his daily companion.
Wuthering Heights,he was about to enlarge further  but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment  my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement.
Wuthering Heights,where is the use of the devil in that sentence    tittered linton.
Wuthering Heights,papa told you not to say any bad words  and you can   t open your mouth without one.
Wuthering Heights,do try to behave like a gentleman  now do        if thou weren   t more a lass than a lad  i   d fell thee this minute  i would  pitiful lath of a crater    retorted the angry boor  retreating  while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification  for he was conscious of being insulted  and embarrassed how to resent it.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff having overheard the conversation  as well as i  smiled when he saw him go  but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair  who remained chattering in the doorway  the boy finding animation enough while discussing hareton   s faults and deficiencies  and relating anecdotes of his goings on  and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings  without considering the ill nature they evinced.
Wuthering Heights,i began to dislike  more than to compassionate linton  and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.
Wuthering Heights,we stayed till afternoon  i could not tear miss cathy away sooner  but happily my master had not quitted his apartment  and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence.
Wuthering Heights,as we walked home  i would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted  but she got it into her head that i was prejudiced against them.
Wuthering Heights,aha    she cried     you take papa   s side  ellen  you are partial i know  or else you wouldn   t have cheated me so many years into the notion that linton lived a long way from here.
Wuthering Heights,i   m really extremely angry  only i   m so pleased i can   t show it  but you must hold your tongue about my uncle  he   s my uncle  remember  and i   ll scold papa for quarrelling with him.
Wuthering Heights,and so she ran on  till i relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake.
Wuthering Heights,she did not mention the visit that night  because she did not see mr. linton.
Wuthering Heights,next day it all came out  sadly to my chagrin  and still i was not altogether sorry  i thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.
Wuthering Heights,but he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the heights  and catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.
Wuthering Heights,papa    she exclaimed  after the morning   s salutations     guess whom i saw yesterday  in my walk on the moors.
Wuthering Heights,ah  papa  you started  you   ve not done right  have you  now  i saw   but listen  and you shall hear how i found you out  and ellen  who is in league with you  and yet pretended to pity me so  when i kept hoping  and was always disappointed about linton   s coming back     she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences  and my master  though he cast more than one reproachful look at me  said nothing till she had concluded.
Wuthering Heights,then he drew her to him  and asked if she knew why he had concealed linton   s near neighbourhood from her  could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy      it was because you disliked mr. heathcliff    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours  cathy    he said.
Wuthering Heights,no  it was not because i disliked mr. heathcliff  but because mr. heathcliff dislikes me  and is a most diabolical man  delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates  if they give him the slightest opportunity.
Wuthering Heights,i knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him  and i knew he would detest you on my account  so for your own good  and nothing else  i took precautions that you should not see linton again.
Wuthering Heights,i meant to explain this some time as you grew older  and i   m sorry i delayed it.
Wuthering Heights,but mr. heathcliff was quite cordial  papa    observed catherine  not at all convinced     and he didn   t object to our seeing each other  he said i might come to his house when i pleased  only i must not tell you  because you had quarrelled with him  and would not forgive him for marrying aunt isabella.
Wuthering Heights,and you won   t. you are the one to be blamed  he is willing to let us be friends  at least  linton and i  and you are not.
Wuthering Heights,my master  perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle in law   s evil disposition  gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to isabella  and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property.
Wuthering Heights,he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic  for though he spoke little of it  he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs. linton   s death.
Wuthering Heights,she might have been living yet  if it had not been for him    was his constant bitter reflection  and  in his eyes  heathcliff seemed a murderer.
Wuthering Heights,miss cathy   conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience  injustice  and passion  arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness  and repented of on the day they were committed   was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years  and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse.
Wuthering Heights,she appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature   excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now   that mr. edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject.
Wuthering Heights,he merely added     you will know hereafter  darling  why i wish you to avoid his house and family  now return to your old employments and amusements  and think no more about them.
Wuthering Heights,catherine kissed her father  and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours  according to custom  then she accompanied him into the grounds  and the whole day passed as usual  but in the evening  when she had retired to her room  and i went to help her to undress  i found her crying  on her knees by the bedside.
Wuthering Heights,oh  fie  silly child    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,if you had any real griefs you   d be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.
Wuthering Heights,you never had one shadow of substantial sorrow  miss catherine.
Wuthering Heights,suppose  for a minute  that master and i were dead  and you were by yourself in the world  how would you feel  then  compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that  and be thankful for the friends you have  instead of coveting more.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not crying for myself  ellen    she answered     it   s for him.
Wuthering Heights,he expected to see me again to morrow  and there he   ll be so disappointed  and he   ll wait for me  and i sha   n   t come        nonsense    said i     do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him  hasn   t he hareton for a companion  not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice  for two afternoons.
Wuthering Heights,linton will conjecture how it is  and trouble himself no further about you.
Wuthering Heights,but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come    she asked  rising to her feet.
Wuthering Heights,and just send those books i promised to lend him  his books are not as nice as mine  and he wanted to have them extremely  when i told him how interesting they were.
Wuthering Heights,may i not  ellen        no  indeed  no  indeed    replied i with decision.
Wuthering Heights,then he would write to you  and there   d never be an end of it.
Wuthering Heights,no  miss catherine  the acquaintance must be dropped entirely  so papa expects  and i shall see that it is done.
Wuthering Heights,but how can one little note       she recommenced  putting on an imploring countenance.
Wuthering Heights,silence    i interrupted.
Wuthering Heights,we   ll not begin with your little notes.
Wuthering Heights,get into bed.
Wuthering Heights,she threw at me a very naughty look  so naughty that i would not kiss her good night at first  i covered her up  and shut her door  in great displeasure  but  repenting half way  i returned softly  and lo  there was miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand  which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll get nobody to take that  catherine    i said     if you write it  and at present i shall put out your candle.
Wuthering Heights,i set the extinguisher on the flame  receiving as i did so a slap on my hand and a petulant    cross thing    i then quitted her again  and she drew the bolt in one of her worst  most peevish humours.
Wuthering Heights,the letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk fetcher who came from the village  but that i didn   t learn till some time afterwards.
Wuthering Heights,weeks passed on  and cathy recovered her temper  though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself  and often  if i came near her suddenly while reading  she would start and bend over the book  evidently desirous to hide it  and i detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves.
Wuthering Heights,she also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen  as if she were expecting the arrival of something  and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library  which she would trifle over for hours  and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.
Wuthering Heights,one day  as she inspected this drawer  i observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper.
Wuthering Heights,my curiosity and suspicions were roused  i determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures  so  at night  as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs  i searched  and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock.
Wuthering Heights,having opened  i emptied the whole contents into my apron  and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber.
Wuthering Heights,though i could not but suspect  i was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence   daily almost  it must have been   from linton heathcliff  answers to documents forwarded by her.
Wuthering Heights,the earlier dated were embarrassed and short  gradually  however  they expanded into copious love letters  foolish  as the age of the writer rendered natural  yet with touches here and there which i thought were borrowed from a more experienced source.
Wuthering Heights,some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness  commencing in strong feeling  and concluding in the affected  wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied  incorporeal sweetheart.
Wuthering Heights,whether they satisfied cathy i don   t know  but they appeared very worthless trash to me.
Wuthering Heights,after turning over as many as i thought proper  i tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside  relocking the vacant drawer.
Wuthering Heights,following her habit  my young lady descended early  and visited the kitchen  i watched her go to the door  on the arrival of a certain little boy  and  while the dairymaid filled his can  she tucked something into his jacket pocket  and plucked something out.
Wuthering Heights,i went round by the garden  and laid wait for the messenger  who fought valorously to defend his trust  and we spilt the milk between us  but i succeeded in abstracting the epistle  and  threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home  i remained under the wall and perused miss cathy   s affectionate composition.
Wuthering Heights,it was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin   s  very pretty and very silly.
Wuthering Heights,i shook my head  and went meditating into the house.
Wuthering Heights,the day being wet  she could not divert herself with rambling about the park  so  at the conclusion of her morning studies  she resorted to the solace of the drawer.
Wuthering Heights,her father sat reading at the table  and i  on purpose  had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain  keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings.
Wuthering Heights,never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest  which it had left brimful of chirping young ones  express more complete despair  in its anguished cries and flutterings  than she by her single    oh    and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton looked up.
Wuthering Heights,what is the matter  love  have you hurt yourself    he said.
Wuthering Heights,his tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard.
Wuthering Heights,no  papa    she gasped.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  ellen  come upstairs   i   m sick     i obeyed her summons  and accompanied her out.
Wuthering Heights,oh  ellen  you have got them    she commenced immediately  dropping on her knees  when we were enclosed alone.
Wuthering Heights,oh  give them to me  and i   ll never  never do so again  don   t tell papa.
Wuthering Heights,you have not told papa  ellen  say you have not  i   ve been exceedingly naughty  but i won   t do it any more     with a grave severity in my manner i bade her stand up.
Wuthering Heights,so    i exclaimed     miss catherine  you are tolerably far on  it seems  you may well be ashamed of them  a fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours  to be sure  why  it   s good enough to be printed  and what do you suppose the master will think when i display it before him  i hav   n   t shown it yet  but you needn   t imagine i shall keep your ridiculous secrets.
Wuthering Heights,for shame  and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities  he would not have thought of beginning  i   m certain.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t  i didn   t    sobbed cathy  fit to break her heart.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t once think of loving him till          loving    cried i  as scornfully as i could utter the word.
Wuthering Heights,loving  did anybody ever hear the like  i might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.
Wuthering Heights,pretty loving  indeed  and both times together you have seen linton hardly four hours in your life  now here is the babyish trash.
Wuthering Heights,i   m going with it to the library  and we   ll see what your father says to such loving.
Wuthering Heights,she sprang at her precious epistles  but i held them above my head  and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn them   do anything rather than show them.
Wuthering Heights,and being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold   for i esteemed it all girlish vanity   i at length relented in a measure  and asked       if i consent to burn them  will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again  nor a book  for i perceive you have sent him books   nor locks of hair  nor rings  nor playthings        we don   t send playthings    cried catherine  her pride overcoming her shame.
Wuthering Heights,nor anything at all  then  my lady    i said.
Wuthering Heights,unless you will  here i go.
Wuthering Heights,i promise  ellen    she cried  catching my dress.
Wuthering Heights,oh  put them in the fire  do  do     but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne.
Wuthering Heights,she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her one or two.
Wuthering Heights,one or two  ellen  to keep for linton   s sake     i unknotted the handkerchief  and commenced dropping them in from an angle  and the flame curled up the chimney.
Wuthering Heights,i will have one  you cruel wretch    she screamed  darting her hand into the fire  and drawing forth some half consumed fragments  at the expense of her fingers.
Wuthering Heights,very well   and i will have some to exhibit to papa    i answered  shaking back the rest into the bundle  and turning anew to the door.
Wuthering Heights,she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames  and motioned me to finish the immolation.
Wuthering Heights,it was done  i stirred up the ashes  and interred them under a shovelful of coals  and she mutely  and with a sense of intense injury  retired to her private apartment.
Wuthering Heights,i descended to tell my master that the young lady   s qualm of sickness was almost gone  but i judged it best for her to lie down a while.
Wuthering Heights,she wouldn   t dine  but she reappeared at tea  pale  and red about the eyes  and marvellously subdued in outward aspect.
Wuthering Heights,next morning i answered the letter by a slip of paper  inscribed     master heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to miss linton  as she will not receive them.
Wuthering Heights,and  thenceforth  the little boy came with vacant pockets.
Wuthering Heights,summer drew to an end  and early autumn  it was past michaelmas  but the harvest was late that year  and a few of our fields were still uncleared.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers  at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk  and the evening happening to be chill and damp  my master caught a bad cold  that settled obstinately on his lungs  and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter  nearly without intermission.
Wuthering Heights,poor cathy  frightened from her little romance  had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment  and her father insisted on her reading less  and taking more exercise.
Wuthering Heights,she had his companionship no longer  i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack  as much as possible  with mine  an inefficient substitute  for i could only spare two or three hours  from my numerous diurnal occupations  to follow her footsteps  and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.
Wuthering Heights,on an afternoon in october  or the beginning of november   a fresh watery afternoon  when the turf and paths were rustling with moist  withered leaves  and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds   dark grey streamers  rapidly mounting from the west  and boding abundant rain   i requested my young lady to forego her ramble  because i was certain of showers.
Wuthering Heights,she refused  and i unwillingly donned a cloak  and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park  a formal walk which she generally affected if low spirited   and that she invariably was when mr. edgar had been worse than ordinary  a thing never known from his confession  but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.
Wuthering Heights,she went sadly on  there was no running or bounding now  though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race.
Wuthering Heights,and often  from the side of my eye  i could detect her raising a hand  and brushing something off her cheek.
Wuthering Heights,i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.
Wuthering Heights,on one side of the road rose a high  rough bank  where hazels and stunted oaks  with their roots half exposed  held uncertain tenure  the soil was too loose for the latter  and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.
Wuthering Heights,in summer miss catherine delighted to climb along these trunks  and sit in the branches  swinging twenty feet above the ground  and i  pleased with her agility and her light  childish heart  still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation  but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.
Wuthering Heights,from dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze rocked cradle  doing nothing except singing old songs   my nursery lore   to herself  or watching the birds  joint tenants  feed and entice their young ones to fly  or nestling with closed lids  half thinking  half dreaming  happier than words can express.
Wuthering Heights,look  miss    i exclaimed  pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree.
Wuthering Heights,winter is not here yet.
Wuthering Heights,there   s a little flower up yonder  the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist.
Wuthering Heights,will you clamber up  and pluck it to show to papa     cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter  and replied  at length      no  i   ll not touch it  but it looks melancholy  does it not  ellen        yes    i observed     about as starved and sackless as you  your cheeks are bloodless  let us take hold of hands and run.
Wuthering Heights,you   re so low  i daresay i shall keep up with you.
Wuthering Heights,no    she repeated  and continued sauntering on  pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss  or a tuft of blanched grass  or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage  and  ever and anon  her hand was lifted to her averted face.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  why are you crying  love    i asked  approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder.
Wuthering Heights,you mustn   t cry because papa has a cold  be thankful it is nothing worse.
Wuthering Heights,she now put no further restraint on her tears  her breath was stifled by sobs.
Wuthering Heights,oh  it will be something worse    she said.
Wuthering Heights,and what shall i do when papa and you leave me  and i am by myself  i can   t forget your words  ellen  they are always in my ear.
Wuthering Heights,how life will be changed  how dreary the world will be  when papa and you are dead.
Wuthering Heights,none can tell whether you won   t die before us    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,it   s wrong to anticipate evil.
Wuthering Heights,we   ll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go  master is young  and i am strong  and hardly forty five.
Wuthering Heights,my mother lived till eighty  a canty dame to the last.
Wuthering Heights,and suppose mr. linton were spared till he saw sixty  that would be more years than you have counted  miss.
Wuthering Heights,and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand        but aunt isabella was younger than papa    she remarked  gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation.
Wuthering Heights,aunt isabella had not you and me to nurse her    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,she wasn   t as happy as master  she hadn   t as much to live for.
Wuthering Heights,all you need do  is to wait well on your father  and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful  and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject  mind that  cathy  i   ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless  and cherished a foolish  fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave  and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.
Wuthering Heights,i fret about nothing on earth except papa   s illness    answered my companion.
Wuthering Heights,i care for nothing in comparison with papa.
Wuthering Heights,and i   ll never   never   oh  never  while i have my senses  do an act or say a word to vex him.
Wuthering Heights,i love him better than myself  ellen  and i know it by this  i pray every night that i may live after him  because i would rather be miserable than that he should be  that proves i love him better than myself.
Wuthering Heights,good words    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,but deeds must prove it also  and after he is well  remember you don   t forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.
Wuthering Heights,as we talked  we neared a door that opened on the road  and my young lady  lightening into sunshine again  climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall  reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side  the lower fruit had disappeared  but only birds could touch the upper  except from cathy   s present station.
Wuthering Heights,in stretching to pull them  her hat fell off  and as the door was locked  she proposed scrambling down to recover it.
Wuthering Heights,i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall  and she nimbly disappeared.
Wuthering Heights,but the return was no such easy matter  the stones were smooth and neatly cemented  and the rosebushes and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re ascending.
Wuthering Heights,i  like a fool  didn   t recollect that  till i heard her laughing and exclaiming      ellen  you   ll have to fetch the key  or else i must run round to the porter   s lodge.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t scale the ramparts on this side        stay where you are    i answered     i have my bundle of keys in my pocket  perhaps i may manage to open it  if not  i   ll go.
Wuthering Heights,catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door  while i tried all the large keys in succession.
Wuthering Heights,i had applied the last  and found that none would do  so  repeating my desire that she would remain there  i was about to hurry home as fast as i could  when an approaching sound arrested me.
Wuthering Heights,it was the trot of a horse  cathy   s dance stopped also.
Wuthering Heights,who is that    i whispered.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  i wish you could open the door    whispered back my companion  anxiously.
Wuthering Heights,ho  miss linton    cried a deep voice  the rider   s      i   m glad to meet you.
Wuthering Heights,don   t be in haste to enter  for i have an explanation to ask and obtain.
Wuthering Heights,i sha   n   t speak to you  mr. heathcliff    answered catherine.
Wuthering Heights,papa says you are a wicked man  and you hate both him and me  and ellen says the same.
Wuthering Heights,that is nothing to the purpose    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,he it was.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t hate my son  i suppose  and it is concerning him that i demand your attention.
Wuthering Heights,yes  you have cause to blush.
Wuthering Heights,two or three months since  were you not in the habit of writing to linton  making love in play  eh  you deserved  both of you  flogging for that  you especially  the elder  and less sensitive  as it turns out.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve got your letters  and if you give me any pertness i   ll send them to your father.
Wuthering Heights,i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it  didn   t you  well  you dropped linton with it into a slough of despond.
Wuthering Heights,he was in earnest  in love  really.
Wuthering Heights,as true as i live  he   s dying for you  breaking his heart at your fickleness  not figuratively  but actually.
Wuthering Heights,though hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks  and i have used more serious measures  and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy  he gets worse daily  and he   ll be under the sod before summer  unless you restore him        how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child    i called from the inside.
Wuthering Heights,pray ride on  how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods  miss cathy  i   ll knock the lock off with a stone  you won   t believe that vile nonsense.
Wuthering Heights,you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.
Wuthering Heights,i was not aware there were eavesdroppers    muttered the detected villain.
Wuthering Heights,worthy mrs. dean  i like you  but i don   t like your double dealing    he added aloud.
Wuthering Heights,how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the    poor child     and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door stones  catherine linton  the very name warms me   my bonny lass  i shall be from home all this week  go and see if i have not spoken truth  do  there   s a darling  just imagine your father in my place  and linton in yours  then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you  when your father himself entreated him  and don   t  from pure stupidity  fall into the same error.
Wuthering Heights,i swear  on my salvation  he   s going to his grave  and none but you can save him     the lock gave way and i issued out.
Wuthering Heights,i swear linton is dying    repeated heathcliff  looking hard at me.
Wuthering Heights,and grief and disappointment are hastening his death.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  if you won   t let her go  you can walk over yourself.
Wuthering Heights,but i shall not return till this time next week  and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.
Wuthering Heights,come in    said i  taking cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re enter  for she lingered  viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker  too stern to express his inward deceit.
Wuthering Heights,he pushed his horse close  and  bending down  observed        miss catherine  i   ll own to you that i have little patience with linton  and hareton and joseph have less.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll own that he   s with a harsh set.
Wuthering Heights,he pines for kindness  as well as love  and a kind word from you would be his best medicine.
Wuthering Heights,don   t mind mrs. dean   s cruel cautions  but be generous  and contrive to see him.
Wuthering Heights,he dreams of you day and night  and cannot be persuaded that you don   t hate him  since you neither write nor call.
Wuthering Heights,i closed the door  and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it  and spreading my umbrella  i drew my charge underneath  for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees  and warned us to avoid delay.
Wuthering Heights,our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with heathcliff  as we stretched towards home  but i divined instinctively that catherine   s heart was clouded now in double darkness.
Wuthering Heights,her features were so sad  they did not seem hers  she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.
Wuthering Heights,the master had retired to rest before we came in.
Wuthering Heights,cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was  he had fallen asleep.
Wuthering Heights,she returned  and asked me to sit with her in the library.
Wuthering Heights,we took our tea together  and afterwards she lay down on the rug  and told me not to talk  for she was weary.
Wuthering Heights,i got a book  and pretended to read.
Wuthering Heights,as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation  she recommenced her silent weeping  it appeared  at present  her favourite diversion.
Wuthering Heights,i suffered her to enjoy it a while  then i expostulated  deriding and ridiculing all mr. heathcliff   s assertions about his son  as if i were certain she would coincide.
Wuthering Heights,alas  i hadn   t skill to counteract the effect his account had produced  it was just what he intended.
Wuthering Heights,you may be right  ellen    she answered     but i shall never feel at ease till i know.
Wuthering Heights,and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i don   t write  and convince him that i shall not change.
Wuthering Heights,what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity  we parted that night   hostile  but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights  by the side of my wilful young mistress   s pony.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t bear to witness her sorrow  to see her pale  dejected countenance  and heavy eyes  and i yielded  in the faint hope that linton himself might prove  by his reception of us  how little of the tale was founded on fact.
Wuthering Heights,the rainy night had ushered in a misty morning   half frost  half drizzle   and temporary brooks crossed our path   gurgling from the uplands.
Wuthering Heights,my feet were thoroughly wetted  i was cross and low  exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.
Wuthering Heights,we entered the farm house by the kitchen way  to ascertain whether mr. heathcliff were really absent  because i put slight faith in his own affirmation.
Wuthering Heights,joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone  beside a roaring fire  a quart of ale on the table near him  bristling with large pieces of toasted oat cake  and his black  short pipe in his mouth.
Wuthering Heights,catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself.
Wuthering Heights,i asked if the master was in  my question remained so long unanswered  that i thought the old man had grown deaf  and repeated it louder.
Wuthering Heights,na   ay    he snarled  or rather screamed through his nose.
Wuthering Heights,na   ay  yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.
Wuthering Heights,joseph    cried a peevish voice  simultaneously with me  from the inner room.
Wuthering Heights,how often am i to call you  there are only a few red ashes now.
Wuthering Heights,joseph  come this moment.
Wuthering Heights,vigorous puffs  and a resolute stare into the grate  declared he had no ear for this appeal.
Wuthering Heights,the housekeeper and hareton were invisible  one gone on an errand  and the other at his work  probably.
Wuthering Heights,we knew linton   s tones  and entered.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i hope you   ll die in a garret  starved to death    said the boy  mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.
Wuthering Heights,he stopped on observing his error  his cousin flew to him.
Wuthering Heights,is that you  miss linton    he said  raising his head from the arm of the great chair  in which he reclined.
Wuthering Heights,no   don   t kiss me  it takes my breath.
Wuthering Heights,dear me  papa said you would call    continued he  after recovering a little from catherine   s embrace  while she stood by looking very contrite.
Wuthering Heights,will you shut the door  if you please  you left it open  and those   those detestable creatures won   t bring coals to the fire.
Wuthering Heights,it   s so cold     i stirred up the cinders  and fetched a scuttleful myself.
Wuthering Heights,the invalid complained of being covered with ashes  but he had a tiresome cough  and looked feverish and ill  so i did not rebuke his temper.
Wuthering Heights,well  linton    murmured catherine  when his corrugated brow relaxed     are you glad to see me  can i do you any good        why didn   t you come before    he asked.
Wuthering Heights,you should have come  instead of writing.
Wuthering Heights,it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.
Wuthering Heights,i   d far rather have talked to you.
Wuthering Heights,now  i can neither bear to talk  nor anything else.
Wuthering Heights,i wonder where zillah is  will you    looking at me     step into the kitchen and see     i had received no thanks for my other service  and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest  i replied        nobody is out there but joseph.
Wuthering Heights,i want to drink    he exclaimed fretfully  turning away.
Wuthering Heights,zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went  it   s miserable  and i   m obliged to come down here   they resolved never to hear me upstairs.
Wuthering Heights,is your father attentive to you  master heathcliff    i asked  perceiving catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.
Wuthering Heights,attentive  he makes them a little more attentive at least    he cried.
Wuthering Heights,the wretches  do you know  miss linton  that brute hareton laughs at me  i hate him  indeed  i hate them all  they are odious beings.
Wuthering Heights,cathy began searching for some water  she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser  filled a tumbler  and brought it.
Wuthering Heights,he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table  and having swallowed a small portion  appeared more tranquil  and said she was very kind.
Wuthering Heights,and are you glad to see me    asked she  reiterating her former question  and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.
Wuthering Heights,yes  i am.
Wuthering Heights,it   s something new to hear a voice like yours    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,but i have been vexed  because you wouldn   t come.
Wuthering Heights,and papa swore it was owing to me  he called me a pitiful  shuffling  worthless thing  and said you despised me  and if he had been in my place  he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time.
Wuthering Heights,but you don   t despise me  do you  miss           i wish you would say catherine  or cathy    interrupted my young lady.
Wuthering Heights,despise you  no  next to papa and ellen  i love you better than anybody living.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t love mr. heathcliff  though  and i dare not come when he returns  will he stay away many days        not many    answered linton     but he goes on to the moors frequently  since the shooting season commenced  and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence.
Wuthering Heights,do say you will.
Wuthering Heights,i think i should not be peevish with you  you   d not provoke me  and you   d always be ready to help me  wouldn   t you        yes    said catherine  stroking his long soft hair     if i could only get papa   s consent  i   d spend half my time with you.
Wuthering Heights,pretty linton  i wish you were my brother.
Wuthering Heights,and then you would like me as well as your father    observed he  more cheerfully.
Wuthering Heights,but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world  if you were my wife  so i   d rather you were that.
Wuthering Heights,no  i should never love anybody better than papa    she returned gravely.
Wuthering Heights,and people hate their wives  sometimes  but not their sisters and brothers  and if you were the latter  you would live with us  and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.
Wuthering Heights,linton denied that people ever hated their wives  but cathy affirmed they did  and  in her wisdom  instanced his own father   s aversion to her aunt.
Wuthering Heights,i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t succeed till everything she knew was out.
Wuthering Heights,master heathcliff  much irritated  asserted her relation was false.
Wuthering Heights,papa told me  and papa does not tell falsehoods    she answered pertly.
Wuthering Heights,my papa scorns yours    cried linton.
Wuthering Heights,he calls him a sneaking fool.
Wuthering Heights,yours is a wicked man    retorted catherine     and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says.
Wuthering Heights,he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella leave him as she did.
Wuthering Heights,she didn   t leave him    said the boy     you sha   n   t contradict me.
Wuthering Heights,she did    cried my young lady.
Wuthering Heights,well  i   ll tell you something    said linton.
Wuthering Heights,your mother hated your father  now then.
Wuthering Heights,oh    exclaimed catherine  too enraged to continue.
Wuthering Heights,and she loved mine    added he.
Wuthering Heights,you little liar  i hate you now    she panted  and her face grew red with passion.
Wuthering Heights,she did  she did    sang linton  sinking into the recess of his chair  and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant  who stood behind.
Wuthering Heights,hush  master heathcliff    i said     that   s your father   s tale  too  i suppose.
Wuthering Heights,it isn   t  you hold your tongue    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,she did  she did  catherine  she did  she did     cathy  beside herself  gave the chair a violent push  and caused him to fall against one arm.
Wuthering Heights,he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph.
Wuthering Heights,it lasted so long that it frightened even me.
Wuthering Heights,as to his cousin  she wept with all her might  aghast at the mischief she had done  though she said nothing.
Wuthering Heights,i held him till the fit exhausted itself.
Wuthering Heights,then he thrust me away  and leant his head down silently.
Wuthering Heights,catherine quelled her lamentations also  took a seat opposite  and looked solemnly into the fire.
Wuthering Heights,how do you feel now  master heathcliff    i inquired  after waiting ten minutes.
Wuthering Heights,i wish she felt as i do    he replied     spiteful  cruel thing  hareton never touches me  he never struck me in his life.
Wuthering Heights,and i was better to day  and there      his voice died in a whimper.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t strike you    muttered cathy  chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.
Wuthering Heights,he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering  and kept it up for a quarter of an hour  on purpose to distress his cousin apparently  for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice.
Wuthering Heights,i   m sorry i hurt you  linton    she said at length  racked beyond endurance.
Wuthering Heights,but i couldn   t have been hurt by that little push  and i had no idea that you could  either  you   re not much  are you  linton  don   t let me go home thinking i   ve done you harm.
Wuthering Heights,answer  speak to me.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t speak to you    he murmured     you   ve hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough.
Wuthering Heights,if you had it you   d know what it was  but you   ll be comfortably asleep while i   m in agony  and nobody near me.
Wuthering Heights,i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights    and he began to wail aloud  for very pity of himself.
Wuthering Heights,since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights    i said     it won   t be miss who spoils your ease  you   d be the same had she never come.
Wuthering Heights,however  she shall not disturb you again  and perhaps you   ll get quieter when we leave you.
Wuthering Heights,must i go    asked catherine dolefully  bending over him.
Wuthering Heights,do you want me to go  linton        you can   t alter what you   ve done    he replied pettishly  shrinking from her     unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.
Wuthering Heights,well  then  i must go    she repeated.
Wuthering Heights,let me alone  at least    said he     i can   t bear your talking.
Wuthering Heights,she lingered  and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while  but as he neither looked up nor spoke  she finally made a movement to the door  and i followed.
Wuthering Heights,we were recalled by a scream.
Wuthering Heights,linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone  and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child  determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can.
Wuthering Heights,i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour  and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him.
Wuthering Heights,not so my companion  she ran back in terror  knelt down  and cried  and soothed  and entreated  till he grew quiet from lack of breath  by no means from compunction at distressing her.
Wuthering Heights,i shall lift him on to the settle    i said     and he may roll about as he pleases  we can   t stop to watch him.
Wuthering Heights,i hope you are satisfied  miss cathy  that you are not the person to benefit him  and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.
Wuthering Heights,now  then  there he is  come away  as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense  he   ll be glad to lie still.
Wuthering Heights,she placed a cushion under his head  and offered him some water  he rejected the latter  and tossed uneasily on the former  as if it were a stone or a block of wood.
Wuthering Heights,she tried to put it more comfortably.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t do with that    he said     it   s not high enough.
Wuthering Heights,catherine brought another to lay above it.
Wuthering Heights,that   s too high    murmured the provoking thing.
Wuthering Heights,how must i arrange it  then    she asked despairingly.
Wuthering Heights,he twined himself up to her  as she half knelt by the settle  and converted her shoulder into a support.
Wuthering Heights,no  that won   t do    i said.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll be content with the cushion  master heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,miss has wasted too much time on you already  we cannot remain five minutes longer.
Wuthering Heights,yes  yes  we can    replied cathy.
Wuthering Heights,he   s good and patient now.
Wuthering Heights,he   s beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will to night  if i believe he is the worse for my visit  and then i dare not come again.
Wuthering Heights,tell the truth about it  linton  for i mustn   t come  if i have hurt you.
Wuthering Heights,you must come  to cure me    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,you ought to come  because you have hurt me  you know you have extremely  i was not as ill when you entered as i am at present   was i        but you   ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t do it all    said his cousin.
Wuthering Heights,however  we   ll be friends now.
Wuthering Heights,and you want me  you would wish to see me sometimes  really        i told you i did    he replied impatiently.
Wuthering Heights,sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee.
Wuthering Heights,that   s as mamma used to do  whole afternoons together.
Wuthering Heights,sit quite still and don   t talk  but you may sing a song  if you can sing  or you may say a nice long interesting ballad   one of those you promised to teach me  or a story.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather have a ballad  though  begin.
Wuthering Heights,catherine repeated the longest she could remember.
Wuthering Heights,the employment pleased both mightily.
Wuthering Heights,linton would have another  and after that another  notwithstanding my strenuous objections  and so they went on until the clock struck twelve  and we heard hareton in the court  returning for his dinner.
Wuthering Heights,and to morrow  catherine  will you be here to morrow    asked young heathcliff  holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.
Wuthering Heights,no    i answered     nor next day neither.
Wuthering Heights,she  however  gave a different response evidently  for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear.
Wuthering Heights,you won   t go to morrow  recollect  miss    i commenced  when we were out of the house.
Wuthering Heights,you are not dreaming of it  are you     she smiled.
Wuthering Heights,oh  i   ll take good care    i continued     i   ll have that lock mended  and you can escape by no way else.
Wuthering Heights,i can get over the wall    she said laughing.
Wuthering Heights,the grange is not a prison  ellen  and you are not my gaoler.
Wuthering Heights,and besides  i   m almost seventeen  i   m a woman.
Wuthering Heights,and i   m certain linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him.
Wuthering Heights,i   m older than he is  you know  and wiser  less childish  am i not  and he   ll soon do as i direct him  with some slight coaxing.
Wuthering Heights,he   s a pretty little darling when he   s good.
Wuthering Heights,i   d make such a pet of him  if he were mine.
Wuthering Heights,we should never quarrel  should we  after we were used to each other  don   t you like him  ellen        like him    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,the worst tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens.
Wuthering Heights,happily  as mr. heathcliff conjectured  he   ll not win twenty.
Wuthering Heights,i doubt whether he   ll see spring  indeed.
Wuthering Heights,and small loss to his family whenever he drops off.
Wuthering Heights,and lucky it is for us that his father took him  the kinder he was treated  the more tedious and selfish he   d be.
Wuthering Heights,i   m glad you have no chance of having him for a husband  miss catherine.
Wuthering Heights,my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.
Wuthering Heights,to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.
Wuthering Heights,he   s younger than i    she answered  after a protracted pause of meditation     and he ought to live the longest  he will   he must live as long as i do.
Wuthering Heights,he   s as strong now as when he first came into the north  i   m positive of that.
Wuthering Heights,it   s only a cold that ails him  the same as papa has.
Wuthering Heights,you say papa will get better  and why shouldn   t he        well  well    i cried     after all  we needn   t trouble ourselves  for listen  miss    and mind  i   ll keep my word    if you attempt going to wuthering heights again  with or without me  i shall inform mr. linton  and  unless he allow it  the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.
Wuthering Heights,it has been revived    muttered cathy  sulkily.
Wuthering Heights,must not be continued  then    i said.
Wuthering Heights,we   ll see    was her reply  and she set off at a gallop  leaving me to toil in the rear.
Wuthering Heights,we both reached home before our dinner time  my master supposed we had been wandering through the park  and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence.
Wuthering Heights,as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings  but sitting such a while at the heights had done the mischief.
Wuthering Heights,on the succeeding morning i was laid up  and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties  a calamity never experienced prior to that period  and never  i am thankful to say  since.
Wuthering Heights,my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me  and cheer my solitude  the confinement brought me exceedingly low.
Wuthering Heights,it is wearisome  to a stirring active body  but few have slighter reasons for complaint than i had.
Wuthering Heights,the moment catherine left mr. linton   s room she appeared at my bedside.
Wuthering Heights,her day was divided between us  no amusement usurped a minute  she neglected her meals  her studies  and her play  and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.
Wuthering Heights,she must have had a warm heart  when she loved her father so  to give so much to me.
Wuthering Heights,i said her days were divided between us  but the master retired early  and i generally needed nothing after six o   clock  thus the evening was her own.
Wuthering Heights,poor thing  i never considered what she did with herself after tea.
Wuthering Heights,and though frequently  when she looked in to bid me good night  i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers  instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors  i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.
Wuthering Heights,at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house.
Wuthering Heights,and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine to read to me  because my eyes were weak.
Wuthering Heights,we were in the library  the master having gone to bed  she consented  rather unwillingly  i fancied  and imagining my sort of books did not suit her  i bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.
Wuthering Heights,she selected one of her own favourites  and got forward steadily about an hour  then came frequent questions.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  are not you tired  hadn   t you better lie down now  you   ll be sick  keeping up so long  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,no  no  dear  i   m not tired    i returned  continually.
Wuthering Heights,perceiving me immovable  she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation.
Wuthering Heights,it changed to yawning  and stretching  and        ellen  i   m tired.
Wuthering Heights,give over then and talk    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,that was worse  she fretted and sighed  and looked at her watch till eight  and finally went to her room  completely overdone with sleep  judging by her peevish  heavy look  and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.
Wuthering Heights,the following night she seemed more impatient still  and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache  and left me.
Wuthering Heights,i thought her conduct odd  and having remained alone a long while  i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better  and asking her to come and lie on the sofa  instead of upstairs in the dark.
Wuthering Heights,no catherine could i discover upstairs  and none below.
Wuthering Heights,the servants affirmed they had not seen her.
Wuthering Heights,i listened at mr. edgar   s door  all was silence.
Wuthering Heights,i returned to her apartment  extinguished my candle  and seated myself in the window.
Wuthering Heights,the moon shone bright  a sprinkling of snow covered the ground  and i reflected that she might  possibly  have taken it into her head to walk about the garden  for refreshment.
Wuthering Heights,i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park  but it was not my young mistress  on its emerging into the light  i recognised one of the grooms.
Wuthering Heights,he stood a considerable period  viewing the carriage road through the grounds  then started off at a brisk pace  as if he had detected something  and reappeared presently  leading miss   s pony  and there she was  just dismounted  and walking by its side.
Wuthering Heights,the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable.
Wuthering Heights,cathy entered by the casement window of the drawing room  and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her.
Wuthering Heights,she put the door gently to  slipped off her snowy shoes  untied her hat  and was proceeding  unconscious of my espionage  to lay aside her mantle  when i suddenly rose and revealed myself.
Wuthering Heights,the surprise petrified her an instant  she uttered an inarticulate exclamation  and stood fixed.
Wuthering Heights,my dear miss catherine    i began  too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold     where have you been riding out at this hour  and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale  where have you been  speak        to the bottom of the park    she stammered.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t tell a tale.
Wuthering Heights,and nowhere else    i demanded.
Wuthering Heights,no    was the muttered reply.
Wuthering Heights,oh  catherine    i cried  sorrowfully.
Wuthering Heights,you know you have been doing wrong  or you wouldn   t be driven to uttering an untruth to me.
Wuthering Heights,that does grieve me.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather be three months ill  than hear you frame a deliberate lie.
Wuthering Heights,she sprang forward  and bursting into tears  threw her arms round my neck.
Wuthering Heights,well  ellen  i   m so afraid of you being angry    she said.
Wuthering Heights,promise not to be angry  and you shall know the very truth  i hate to hide it.
Wuthering Heights,we sat down in the window seat  i assured her i would not scold  whatever her secret might be  and i guessed it  of course  so she commenced        i   ve been to wuthering heights  ellen  and i   ve never missed going a day since you fell ill  except thrice before  and twice after you left your room.
Wuthering Heights,i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening  and to put her back in the stable  you mustn   t scold him either  mind.
Wuthering Heights,i was at the heights by half past six  and generally stayed till half past eight  and then galloped home.
Wuthering Heights,it was not to amuse myself that i went  i was often wretched all the time.
Wuthering Heights,now and then i was happy  once in a week perhaps.
Wuthering Heights,at first  i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to linton  for i had engaged to call again next day  when we quitted him  but  as you stayed upstairs on the morrow  i escaped that trouble.
Wuthering Heights,while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon  i got possession of the key  and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him  because he was sick  and couldn   t come to the grange  and how papa would object to my going  and then i negotiated with him about the pony.
Wuthering Heights,he is fond of reading  and he thinks of leaving soon to get married  so he offered  if i would lend him books out of the library  to do what i wished  but i preferred giving him my own  and that satisfied him better.
Wuthering Heights,on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits  and zillah  that is their housekeeper  made us a clean room and a good fire  and told us that  as joseph was out at a prayer meeting and hareton earnshaw was off with his dogs   robbing our woods of pheasants  as i heard afterwards   we might do what we liked.
Wuthering Heights,she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread  and appeared exceedingly good natured  and linton sat in the arm chair  and i in the little rocking chair on the hearth stone  and we laughed and talked so merrily  and found so much to say  we planned where we would go  and what we would do in summer.
Wuthering Heights,i needn   t repeat that  because you would call it silly.
Wuthering Heights,one time  however  we were near quarrelling.
Wuthering Heights,he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors  with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom  and the larks singing high up overhead  and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.
Wuthering Heights,that was his most perfect idea of heaven   s happiness  mine was rocking in a rustling green tree  with a west wind blowing  and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above  and not only larks  but throstles  and blackbirds  and linnets  and cuckoos pouring out music on every side  and the moors seen at a distance  broken into cool dusky dells  but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze  and woods and sounding water  and the whole world awake and wild with joy.
Wuthering Heights,he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace  i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee.
Wuthering Heights,i said his heaven would be only half alive  and he said mine would be drunk  i said i should fall asleep in his  and he said he could not breathe in mine  and began to grow very snappish.
Wuthering Heights,at last  we agreed to try both  as soon as the right weather came  and then we kissed each other and were friends.
Wuthering Heights,after sitting still an hour  i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor  and thought how nice it would be to play in  if we removed the table  and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us  and we   d have a game at blindman   s buff  she should try to catch us  you used to  you know  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,he wouldn   t  there was no pleasure in it  he said  but he consented to play at ball with me.
Wuthering Heights,we found two in a cupboard  among a heap of old toys  tops  and hoops  and battledores and shuttlecocks.
Wuthering Heights,one was marked c.  and the other h.  i wished to have the c.  because that stood for catherine  and the h. might be for heathcliff  his name  but the bran came out of h.  and linton didn   t like it.
Wuthering Heights,i beat him constantly  and he got cross again  and coughed  and returned to his chair.
Wuthering Heights,that night  though  he easily recovered his good humour  he was charmed with two or three pretty songs   your songs  ellen  and when i was obliged to go  he begged and entreated me to come the following evening  and i promised.
Wuthering Heights,minny and i went flying home as light as air  and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet  darling cousin  till morning.
Wuthering Heights,on the morrow i was sad  partly because you were poorly  and partly that i wished my father knew  and approved of my excursions  but it was beautiful moonlight after tea  and  as i rode on  the gloom cleared.
Wuthering Heights,i shall have another happy evening  i thought to myself  and what delights me more  my pretty linton will.
Wuthering Heights,i trotted up their garden  and was turning round to the back  when that fellow earnshaw met me  took my bridle  and bid me go in by the front entrance.
Wuthering Heights,he patted minny   s neck  and said she was a bonny beast  and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him.
Wuthering Heights,i only told him to leave my horse alone  or else it would kick him.
Wuthering Heights,he answered in his vulgar accent     it wouldn   t do mitch hurt if it did     and surveyed its legs with a smile.
Wuthering Heights,i was half inclined to make it try  however  he moved off to open the door  and  as he raised the latch  he looked up to the inscription above  and said  with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation     miss catherine  i can read yon  now.
Wuthering Heights,wonderful     i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,pray let us hear you   you are grown clever         he spelt  and drawled over by syllables  the name      hareton earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,and the figures     i cried  encouragingly  perceiving that he came to a dead halt.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot tell them yet     he answered.
Wuthering Heights,oh  you dunce     i said  laughing heartily at his failure.
Wuthering Heights,the fool stared  with a grin hovering about his lips  and a scowl gathering over his eyes  as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth  whether it were not pleasant familiarity  or what it really was  contempt.
Wuthering Heights,i settled his doubts  by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away  for i came to see linton  not him.
Wuthering Heights,he reddened   i saw that by the moonlight   dropped his hand from the latch  and skulked off  a picture of mortified vanity.
Wuthering Heights,he imagined himself to be as accomplished as linton  i suppose  because he could spell his own name  and was marvellously discomfited that i didn   t think the same.
Wuthering Heights,stop  miss catherine  dear    i interrupted.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not scold  but i don   t like your conduct there.
Wuthering Heights,if you had remembered that hareton was your cousin as much as master heathcliff  you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way.
Wuthering Heights,at least  it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton  and probably he did not learn merely to show off  you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before  i have no doubt  and he wished to remedy it and please you.
Wuthering Heights,to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.
Wuthering Heights,had you been brought up in his circumstances  would you be less rude  he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were  and i   m hurt that he should be despised now  because that base heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.
Wuthering Heights,well  ellen  you won   t cry about it  will you    she exclaimed  surprised at my earnestness.
Wuthering Heights,but wait  and you shall hear if he conned his a b c to please me  and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.
Wuthering Heights,i entered  linton was lying on the settle  and half got up to welcome me.
Wuthering Heights,i   m ill to night  catherine  love     he said     and you must have all the talk  and let me listen.
Wuthering Heights,come  and sit by me.
Wuthering Heights,i was sure you wouldn   t break your word  and i   ll make you promise again  before you go.
Wuthering Heights,i knew now that i mustn   t tease him  as he was ill  and i spoke softly and put no questions  and avoided irritating him in any way.
Wuthering Heights,i had brought some of my nicest books for him  he asked me to read a little of one  and i was about to comply  when earnshaw burst the door open  having gathered venom with reflection.
Wuthering Heights,he advanced direct to us  seized linton by the arm  and swung him off the seat.
Wuthering Heights,get to thy own room     he said  in a voice almost inarticulate with passion  and his face looked swelled and furious.
Wuthering Heights,take her there if she comes to see thee  thou shalln   t keep me out of this.
Wuthering Heights,begone wi    ye both         he swore at us  and left linton no time to answer  nearly throwing him into the kitchen  and he clenched his fist as i followed  seemingly longing to knock me down.
Wuthering Heights,i was afraid for a moment  and i let one volume fall  he kicked it after me  and shut us out.
Wuthering Heights,i heard a malignant  crackly laugh by the fire  and turning  beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hands  and quivering.
Wuthering Heights,i wer sure he   d sarve ye out  he   s a grand lad  he   s getten t    raight sperrit in him  he knaws   ay  he knaws  as weel as i do  who sud be t    maister yonder   ech  ech  ech  he made ye skift properly  ech  ech  ech            where must we go     i asked of my cousin  disregarding the old wretch   s mockery.
Wuthering Heights,linton was white and trembling.
Wuthering Heights,he was not pretty then  ellen  oh  no  he looked frightful  for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic  powerless fury.
Wuthering Heights,he grasped the handle of the door  and shook it  it was fastened inside.
Wuthering Heights,if you don   t let me in  i   ll kill you    if you don   t let me in  i   ll kill you     he rather shrieked than said.
Wuthering Heights,devil  devil    i   ll kill you   i   ll kill you         joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.
Wuthering Heights,thear  that   s t    father     he cried.
Wuthering Heights,that   s father  we   ve allas summut o    either side in us.
Wuthering Heights,niver heed  hareton  lad   dunnut be    feard   he cannot get at thee         i took hold of linton   s hands  and tried to pull him away  but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed.
Wuthering Heights,at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing  blood gushed from his mouth  and he fell on the ground.
Wuthering Heights,i ran into the yard  sick with terror  and called for zillah  as loud as i could.
Wuthering Heights,she soon heard me  she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn  and hurrying from her work  she inquired what there was to do  i hadn   t breath to explain  dragging her in  i looked about for linton.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused  and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs.
Wuthering Heights,zillah and i ascended after him  but he stopped me at the top of the steps  and said i shouldn   t go in  i must go home.
Wuthering Heights,i exclaimed that he had killed linton  and i would enter.
Wuthering Heights,joseph locked the door  and declared i should do    no sich stuff     and asked me whether i were    bahn to be as mad as him.
Wuthering Heights,i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.
Wuthering Heights,she affirmed he would be better in a bit  but he couldn   t do with that shrieking and din  and she took me  and nearly carried me into the house.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  i was ready to tear my hair off my head  i sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind  and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite  presuming every now and then to bid me    wisht     and denying that it was his fault  and  finally  frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa  and that he should be put in prison and hanged  he commenced blubbering himself  and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation.
Wuthering Heights,still  i was not rid of him  when at length they compelled me to depart  and i had got some hundred yards off the premises  he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side  and checked minny and took hold of me.
Wuthering Heights,miss catherine  i   m ill grieved     he began     but it   s rayther too bad           i gave him a cut with my whip  thinking perhaps he would murder me.
Wuthering Heights,he let go  thundering one of his horrid curses  and i galloped home more than half out of my senses.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t bid you good night that evening  and i didn   t go to wuthering heights the next  i wished to go exceedingly  but i was strangely excited  and dreaded to hear that linton was dead  sometimes  and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton.
Wuthering Heights,on the third day i took courage  at least  i couldn   t bear longer suspense  and stole off once more.
Wuthering Heights,i went at five o   clock  and walked  fancying i might manage to creep into the house  and up to linton   s room  unobserved.
Wuthering Heights,however  the dogs gave notice of my approach.
Wuthering Heights,zillah received me  and saying    the lad was mending nicely     showed me into a small  tidy  carpeted apartment  where  to my inexpressible joy  i beheld linton laid on a little sofa  reading one of my books.
Wuthering Heights,but he would neither speak to me nor look at me  through a whole hour  ellen  he has such an unhappy temper.
Wuthering Heights,and what quite confounded me  when he did open his mouth  it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar  and hareton was not to blame  unable to reply  except passionately  i got up and walked from the room.
Wuthering Heights,he sent after me a faint    catherine     he did not reckon on being answered so  but i wouldn   t turn back  and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home  nearly determined to visit him no more.
Wuthering Heights,but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up  and never hearing anything about him  that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.
Wuthering Heights,it had appeared wrong to take the journey once  now it seemed wrong to refrain.
Wuthering Heights,michael came to ask if he must saddle minny  i said    yes     and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills.
Wuthering Heights,i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court  it was no use trying to conceal my presence.
Wuthering Heights,young master is in the house     said zillah  as she saw me making for the parlour.
Wuthering Heights,i went in  earnshaw was there also  but he quitted the room directly.
Wuthering Heights,linton sat in the great arm chair half asleep  walking up to the fire  i began in a serious tone  partly meaning it to be true           as you don   t like me  linton  and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you  and pretend that i do so every time  this is our last meeting  let us say good bye  and tell mr. heathcliff that you have no wish to see me  and that he mustn   t invent any more falsehoods on the subject.
Wuthering Heights,sit down and take your hat off  catherine     he answered.
Wuthering Heights,you are so much happier than i am  you ought to be better.
Wuthering Heights,papa talks enough of my defects  and shows enough scorn of me  to make it natural i should doubt myself.
Wuthering Heights,i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me  frequently  and then i feel so cross and bitter  i hate everybody  i am worthless  and bad in temper  and bad in spirit  almost always  and  if you choose  you may say good bye  you   ll get rid of an annoyance.
Wuthering Heights,only  catherine  do me this justice  believe that if i might be as sweet  and as kind  and as good as you are  i would be  as willingly  and more so  than as happy and as healthy.
Wuthering Heights,and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love  and though i couldn   t  and cannot help showing my nature to you  i regret it and repent it  and shall regret and repent it till i die         i felt he spoke the truth  and i felt i must forgive him  and  though we should quarrel the next moment  i must forgive him again.
Wuthering Heights,we were reconciled  but we cried  both of us  the whole time i stayed  not entirely for sorrow  yet i was sorry linton had that distorted nature.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll never let his friends be at ease  and he   ll never be at ease himself  i have always gone to his little parlour  since that night  because his father returned the day after.
Wuthering Heights,about three times  i think  we have been merry and hopeful  as we were the first evening  the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled  now with his selfishness and spite  and now with his sufferings  but i   ve learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff purposely avoids me  i have hardly seen him at all.
Wuthering Heights,last sunday  indeed  coming earlier than usual  i heard him abusing poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t tell how he knew of it  unless he listened.
Wuthering Heights,linton had certainly behaved provokingly  however  it was the business of nobody but me  and i interrupted mr. heathcliff   s lecture by entering and telling him so.
Wuthering Heights,he burst into a laugh  and went away  saying he was glad i took that view of the matter.
Wuthering Heights,since then  i   ve told linton he must whisper his bitter things.
Wuthering Heights,now  ellen  you have heard all.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t be prevented from going to wuthering heights  except by inflicting misery on two people  whereas  if you   ll only not tell papa  my going need disturb the tranquillity of none.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll not tell  will you  it will be very heartless  if you do.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll make up my mind on that point by to morrow  miss catherine    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,it requires some study  and so i   ll leave you to your rest  and go think it over.
Wuthering Heights,i thought it over aloud  in my master   s presence  walking straight from her room to his  and relating the whole story  with the exception of her conversations with her cousin  and any mention of hareton.
Wuthering Heights,mr. linton was alarmed and distressed  more than he would acknowledge to me.
Wuthering Heights,in the morning  catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence  and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end.
Wuthering Heights,in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict  and implored her father to have pity on linton  all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased  but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights.
Wuthering Heights,perhaps  had he been aware of his nephew   s disposition and state of health  he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.
Wuthering Heights,these things happened last winter  sir    said mrs. dean     hardly more than a year ago.
Wuthering Heights,last winter  i did not think  at another twelve months    end  i should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them  yet  who knows how long you   ll be a stranger  you   re too young to rest always contented  living by yourself  and i some way fancy no one could see catherine linton and not love her.
Wuthering Heights,you smile  but why do you look so lively and interested when i talk about her  and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace  and why           stop  my good friend    i cried.
Wuthering Heights,it may be very possible that i should love her  but would she love me  i doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation  and then my home is not here.
Wuthering Heights,i   m of the busy world  and to its arms i must return.
Wuthering Heights,go on.
Wuthering Heights,was catherine obedient to her father   s commands        she was    continued the housekeeper.
Wuthering Heights,her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart  and he spoke without anger  he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes  where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her.
Wuthering Heights,he said to me  a few days afterwards     i wish my nephew would write  ellen  or call.
Wuthering Heights,tell me  sincerely  what you think of him  is he changed for the better  or is there a prospect of improvement  as he grows a man            he   s very delicate  sir     i replied     and scarcely likely to reach manhood  but this i can say  he does not resemble his father  and if miss catherine had the misfortune to marry him  he would not be beyond her control  unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.
Wuthering Heights,however  master  you   ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her  it wants four years and more to his being of age.
Wuthering Heights,edgar sighed  and  walking to the window  looked out towards gimmerton kirk.
Wuthering Heights,it was a misty afternoon  but the february sun shone dimly  and we could just distinguish the two fir trees in the yard  and the sparely scattered gravestones.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve prayed often    he half soliloquised     for the approach of what is coming  and now i begin to shrink  and fear it.
Wuthering Heights,i thought the memory of the hour i came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that i was soon  in a few months  or  possibly  weeks  to be carried up  and laid in its lonely hollow  ellen  i   ve been very happy with my little cathy  through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ve been as happy musing by myself among those stones  under that old church  lying  through the long june evenings  on the green mound of her mother   s grave  and wishing   yearning for the time when i might lie beneath it.
Wuthering Heights,what can i do for cathy  how must i quit her  i   d not care one moment for linton being heathcliff   s son  nor for his taking her from me  if he could console her for my loss.
Wuthering Heights,i   d not care that heathcliff gained his ends  and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing  but should linton be unworthy   only a feeble tool to his father   i cannot abandon her to him  and  hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit  i must persevere in making her sad while i live  and leaving her solitary when i die.
Wuthering Heights,darling  i   d rather resign her to god  and lay her in the earth before me.
Wuthering Heights,resign her to god as it is  sir    i answered     and if we should lose you   which may he forbid   under his providence  i   ll stand her friend and counsellor to the last.
Wuthering Heights,miss catherine is a good girl  i don   t fear that she will go wilfully wrong  and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded.
Wuthering Heights,spring advanced  yet my master gathered no real strength  though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.
Wuthering Heights,to her inexperienced notions  this itself was a sign of convalescence  and then his cheek was often flushed  and his eyes were bright  she felt sure of his recovering.
Wuthering Heights,on her seventeenth birthday  he did not visit the churchyard  it was raining  and i observed        you   ll surely not go out to night  sir     he answered       no  i   ll defer it this year a little longer.
Wuthering Heights,he wrote again to linton  expressing his great desire to see him  and  had the invalid been presentable  i   ve no doubt his father would have permitted him to come.
Wuthering Heights,as it was  being instructed  he returned an answer  intimating that mr. heathcliff objected to his calling at the grange  but his uncle   s kind remembrance delighted him  and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles  and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.
Wuthering Heights,that part of his letter was simple  and probably his own.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for catherine   s company  then.
Wuthering Heights,i do not ask    he said     that she may visit here  but am i never to see her  because my father forbids me to go to her home  and you forbid her to come to mine  do  now and then  ride with her towards the heights  and let us exchange a few words  in your presence  we have done nothing to deserve this separation  and you are not angry with me  you have no reason to dislike me  you allow  yourself.
Wuthering Heights,dear uncle  send me a kind note to morrow  and leave to join you anywhere you please  except at thrushcross grange.
Wuthering Heights,i believe an interview would convince you that my father   s character is not mine  he affirms i am more your nephew than his son  and though i have faults which render me unworthy of catherine  she has excused them  and for her sake  you should also.
Wuthering Heights,you inquire after my health   it is better  but while i remain cut off from all hope  and doomed to solitude  or the society of those who never did and never will like me  how can i be cheerful and well     edgar  though he felt for the boy  could not consent to grant his request  because he could not accompany catherine.
Wuthering Heights,he said  in summer  perhaps  they might meet  meantime  he wished him to continue writing at intervals  and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter  being well aware of his hard position in his family.
Wuthering Heights,linton complied  and had he been unrestrained  would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations  but his father kept a sharp watch over him  and  of course  insisted on every line that my master sent being shown  so  instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses  the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts  he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love  and gently intimated that mr. linton must allow an interview soon  or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.
Wuthering Heights,cathy was a powerful ally at home  and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week  under my guardianship  and on the moors nearest the grange  for june found him still declining.
Wuthering Heights,though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady   s fortune  he had a natural desire that she might retain   or at least return in a short time to   the house of her ancestors  and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir  he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself  nor had any one  i believe  no doctor visited the heights  and no one saw master heathcliff to make report of his condition among us.
Wuthering Heights,i  for my part  began to fancy my forebodings were false  and that he must be actually rallying  when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors  and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object.
Wuthering Heights,i could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as i afterwards learned heathcliff had treated him  to compel this apparent eagerness  his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death.
Wuthering Heights,summer was already past its prime  when edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties  and catherine and i set out on our first ride to join her cousin.
Wuthering Heights,it was a close  sultry day  devoid of sunshine  but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain  and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide stone  by the cross roads.
Wuthering Heights,on arriving there  however  a little herd boy  despatched as a messenger  told us that       maister linton wer just o    this side th    heights  and he   d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.
Wuthering Heights,then master linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle    i observed     he bid us keep on the grange land  and here we are off at once.
Wuthering Heights,well  we   ll turn our horses    heads round when we reach him    answered my companion     our excursion shall lie towards home.
Wuthering Heights,but when we reached him  and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door  we found he had no horse  and we were forced to dismount  and leave ours to graze.
Wuthering Heights,he lay on the heath  awaiting our approach  and did not rise till we came within a few yards.
Wuthering Heights,then he walked so feebly  and looked so pale  that i immediately exclaimed       why  master heathcliff  you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.
Wuthering Heights,how ill you do look     catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment  she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm  and the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry  whether he were worse than usual      no   better   better    he panted  trembling  and retaining her hand as if he needed its support  while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her  the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed.
Wuthering Heights,but you have been worse    persisted his cousin     worse than when i saw you last  you are thinner  and          i   m tired    he interrupted  hurriedly.
Wuthering Heights,it is too hot for walking  let us rest here.
Wuthering Heights,and  in the morning  i often feel sick   papa says i grow so fast.
Wuthering Heights,badly satisfied  cathy sat down  and he reclined beside her.
Wuthering Heights,this is something like your paradise    said she  making an effort at cheerfulness.
Wuthering Heights,you recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest  this is nearly yours  only there are clouds  but then they are so soft and mellow  it is nicer than sunshine.
Wuthering Heights,next week  if you can  we   ll ride down to the grange park  and try mine.
Wuthering Heights,linton did not appear to remember what she talked of  and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.
Wuthering Heights,his lack of interest in the subjects she started  and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment  were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment.
Wuthering Heights,an indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner.
Wuthering Heights,the pettishness that might be caressed into fondness  had yielded to a listless apathy  there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed  and more of the self absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid  repelling consolation  and ready to regard the good humoured mirth of others as an insult.
Wuthering Heights,catherine perceived  as well as i did  that he held it rather a punishment  than a gratification  to endure our company  and she made no scruple of proposing  presently  to depart.
Wuthering Heights,that proposal  unexpectedly  roused linton from his lethargy  and threw him into a strange state of agitation.
Wuthering Heights,he glanced fearfully towards the heights  begging she would remain another half hour  at least.
Wuthering Heights,but i think    said cathy     you   d be more comfortable at home than sitting here  and i cannot amuse you to day  i see  by my tales  and songs  and chatter  you have grown wiser than i  in these six months  you have little taste for my diversions now  or else  if i could amuse you  i   d willingly stay.
Wuthering Heights,stay to rest yourself    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,and  catherine  don   t think or say that i   m very unwell  it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull  and i walked about  before you came  a great deal for me.
Wuthering Heights,tell uncle i   m in tolerable health  will you        i   ll tell him that you say so  linton.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t affirm that you are    observed my young lady  wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth.
Wuthering Heights,and be here again next thursday    continued he  shunning her puzzled gaze.
Wuthering Heights,and give him my thanks for permitting you to come   my best thanks  catherine.
Wuthering Heights,and   and  if you did meet my father  and he asked you about me  don   t lead him to suppose that i   ve been extremely silent and stupid  don   t look sad and downcast  as you are doing   he   ll be angry.
Wuthering Heights,i care nothing for his anger    exclaimed cathy  imagining she would be its object.
Wuthering Heights,but i do    said her cousin  shuddering.
Wuthering Heights,don   t provoke him against me  catherine  for he is very hard.
Wuthering Heights,is he severe to you  master heathcliff    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,has he grown weary of indulgence  and passed from passive to active hatred     linton looked at me  but did not answer  and  after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes  during which his head fell drowsily on his breast  and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain  cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries  and sharing the produce of her researches with me  she did not offer them to him  for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.
Wuthering Heights,is it half an hour now  ellen    she whispered in my ear  at last.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t tell why we should stay.
Wuthering Heights,he   s asleep  and papa will be wanting us back.
Wuthering Heights,well  we must not leave him asleep    i answered     wait till he wakes  and be patient.
Wuthering Heights,you were mighty eager to set off  but your longing to see poor linton has soon evaporated        why did he wish to see me    returned catherine.
Wuthering Heights,in his crossest humours  formerly  i liked him better than i do in his present curious mood.
Wuthering Heights,it   s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform   this interview   for fear his father should scold him.
Wuthering Heights,but i   m hardly going to come to give mr. heathcliff pleasure  whatever reason he may have for ordering linton to undergo this penance.
Wuthering Heights,and  though i   m glad he   s better in health  i   m sorry he   s so much less pleasant  and so much less affectionate to me.
Wuthering Heights,you think he is better in health  then    i said.
Wuthering Heights,yes    she answered     because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings  you know.
Wuthering Heights,he is not tolerably well  as he told me to tell papa  but he   s better  very likely.
Wuthering Heights,there you differ with me  miss cathy    i remarked     i should conjecture him to be far worse.
Wuthering Heights,linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror  and asked if any one had called his name.
Wuthering Heights,no    said catherine     unless in dreams.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors  in the morning.
Wuthering Heights,i thought i heard my father    he gasped  glancing up to the frowning nab above us.
Wuthering Heights,you are sure nobody spoke        quite sure    replied his cousin.
Wuthering Heights,only ellen and i were disputing concerning your health.
Wuthering Heights,are you truly stronger  linton  than when we separated in winter  if you be  i   m certain one thing is not stronger   your regard for me  speak    are you     the tears gushed from linton   s eyes as he answered     yes  yes  i am    and  still under the spell of the imaginary voice  his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner.
Wuthering Heights,cathy rose.
Wuthering Heights,for to day we must part    she said.
Wuthering Heights,and i won   t conceal that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting  though i   ll mention it to nobody but you  not that i stand in awe of mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,hush    murmured linton     for god   s sake  hush  he   s coming.
Wuthering Heights,and he clung to catherine   s arm  striving to detain her  but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself  and whistled to minny  who obeyed her like a dog.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll be here next thursday    she cried  springing to the saddle.
Wuthering Heights,good bye.
Wuthering Heights,quick  ellen     and so we left him  scarcely conscious of our departure  so absorbed was he in anticipating his father   s approach.
Wuthering Heights,before we reached home  catherine   s displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret  largely blended with vague  uneasy doubts about linton   s actual circumstances  physical and social  in which i partook  though i counselled her not to say much  for a second journey would make us better judges.
Wuthering Heights,my master requested an account of our ongoings.
Wuthering Heights,his nephew   s offering of thanks was duly delivered  miss cathy gently touching on the rest  i also threw little light on his inquiries  for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.
Wuthering Heights,seven days glided away  every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of edgar linton   s state.
Wuthering Heights,the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.
Wuthering Heights,catherine we would fain have deluded yet  but her own quick spirit refused to delude her  it divined in secret  and brooded on the dreadful probability  gradually ripening into certainty.
Wuthering Heights,she had not the heart to mention her ride  when thursday came round  i mentioned it for her  and obtained permission to order her out of doors  for the library  where her father stopped a short time daily   the brief period he could bear to sit up   and his chamber  had become her whole world.
Wuthering Heights,she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow  or seated by his side.
Wuthering Heights,her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow  and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society  drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.
Wuthering Heights,he had a fixed idea  i guessed by several observations he let fall  that  as his nephew resembled him in person  he would resemble him in mind  for linton   s letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.
Wuthering Heights,and i  through pardonable weakness  refrained from correcting the error  asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.
Wuthering Heights,we deferred our excursion till the afternoon  a golden afternoon of august  every breath from the hills so full of life  that it seemed whoever respired it  though dying  might revive.
Wuthering Heights,catherine   s face was just like the landscape   shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession  but the shadows rested longer  and the sunshine was more transient  and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.
Wuthering Heights,we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.
Wuthering Heights,my young mistress alighted  and told me that  as she was resolved to stay a very little while  i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback  but i dissented  i wouldn   t risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute  so we climbed the slope of heath together.
Wuthering Heights,master heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion  not the animation of high spirits though  nor yet of joy  it looked more like fear.
Wuthering Heights,it is late    he said  speaking short and with difficulty.
Wuthering Heights,is not your father very ill  i thought you wouldn   t come.
Wuthering Heights,why won   t you be candid    cried catherine  swallowing her greeting.
Wuthering Heights,why cannot you say at once you don   t want me  it is strange  linton  that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose  apparently to distress us both  and for no reason besides     linton shivered  and glanced at her  half supplicating  half ashamed  but his cousin   s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour.
Wuthering Heights,my father is very ill    she said     and why am i called from his bedside  why didn   t you send to absolve me from my promise  when you wished i wouldn   t keep it  come  i desire an explanation  playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind  and i can   t dance attendance on your affectations now        my affectations    he murmured     what are they  for heaven   s sake  catherine  don   t look so angry  despise me as much as you please  i am a worthless  cowardly wretch  i can   t be scorned enough  but i   m too mean for your anger.
Wuthering Heights,hate my father  and spare me for contempt.
Wuthering Heights,nonsense    cried catherine in a passion.
Wuthering Heights,foolish  silly boy  and there  he trembles  as if i were really going to touch him  you needn   t bespeak contempt  linton  anybody will have it spontaneously at your service.
Wuthering Heights,get off  i shall return home  it is folly dragging you from the hearth stone  and pretending   what do we pretend  let go my frock  if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened  you should spurn such pity.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.
Wuthering Heights,rise  and don   t degrade yourself into an abject reptile   don   t     with streaming face and an expression of agony  linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground  he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror.
Wuthering Heights,oh    he sobbed     i cannot bear it  catherine  catherine  i   m a traitor  too  and i dare not tell you  but leave me  and i shall be killed  dear catherine  my life is in your hands  and you have said you loved me  and if you did  it wouldn   t harm you.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll not go  then  kind  sweet  good catherine  and perhaps you will consent   and he   ll let me die with you     my young lady  on witnessing his intense anguish  stooped to raise him.
Wuthering Heights,the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation  and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.
Wuthering Heights,consent to what    she asked.
Wuthering Heights,to stay  tell me the meaning of this strange talk  and i will.
Wuthering Heights,you contradict your own words  and distract me  be calm and frank  and confess at once all that weighs on your heart.
Wuthering Heights,you wouldn   t injure me  linton  would you  you wouldn   t let any enemy hurt me  if you could prevent it  i   ll believe you are a coward  for yourself  but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.
Wuthering Heights,but my father threatened me    gasped the boy  clasping his attenuated fingers     and i dread him   i dread him  i dare not tell        oh  well    said catherine  with scornful compassion     keep your secret  i   m no coward.
Wuthering Heights,save yourself  i   m not afraid     her magnanimity provoked his tears  he wept wildly  kissing her supporting hands  and yet could not summon courage to speak out.
Wuthering Heights,i was cogitating what the mystery might be  and determined catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else  by my good will  when  hearing a rustle among the ling  i looked up and saw mr. heathcliff almost close upon us  descending the heights.
Wuthering Heights,he didn   t cast a glance towards my companions  though they were sufficiently near for linton   s sobs to be audible  but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides  and the sincerity of which i couldn   t avoid doubting  he said        it is something to see you so near to my house  nelly.
Wuthering Heights,how are you at the grange  let us hear.
Wuthering Heights,the rumour goes    he added  in a lower tone     that edgar linton is on his death bed  perhaps they exaggerate his illness        no  my master is dying    i replied     it is true enough.
Wuthering Heights,a sad thing it will be for us all  but a blessing for him        how long will he last  do you think    he asked.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t know    i said.
Wuthering Heights,because    he continued  looking at the two young people  who were fixed under his eye   linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head  and catherine could not move  on his account      because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me  and i   d thank his uncle to be quick  and go before him  hallo  has the whelp been playing that game long  i did give him some lessons about snivelling.
Wuthering Heights,is he pretty lively with miss linton generally        lively  no   he has shown the greatest distress    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,to see him  i should say  that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills  he ought to be in bed  under the hands of a doctor.
Wuthering Heights,he shall be  in a day or two    muttered heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,but first   get up  linton  get up    he shouted.
Wuthering Heights,don   t grovel on the ground there  up  this moment     linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear  caused by his father   s glance towards him  i suppose  there was nothing else to produce such humiliation.
Wuthering Heights,he made several efforts to obey  but his little strength was annihilated for the time  and he fell back again with a moan.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff advanced  and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf.
Wuthering Heights,now    said he  with curbed ferocity     i   m getting angry   and if you don   t command that paltry spirit of yours   damn you  get up directly        i will  father    he panted.
Wuthering Heights,only  let me alone  or i shall faint.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve done as you wished  i   m sure.
Wuthering Heights,catherine will tell you that i   that i   have been cheerful.
Wuthering Heights,ah  keep by me  catherine  give me your hand.
Wuthering Heights,take mine    said his father     stand on your feet.
Wuthering Heights,there now   she   ll lend you her arm  that   s right  look at her.
Wuthering Heights,you would imagine i was the devil himself  miss linton  to excite such horror.
Wuthering Heights,be so kind as to walk home with him  will you  he shudders if i touch him.
Wuthering Heights,linton dear    whispered catherine     i can   t go to wuthering heights  papa has forbidden me.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll not harm you  why are you so afraid        i can never re enter that house    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not to re enter it without you        stop    cried his father.
Wuthering Heights,we   ll respect catherine   s filial scruples.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  take him in  and i   ll follow your advice concerning the doctor  without delay.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll do well    replied i.
Wuthering Heights,but i must remain with my mistress  to mind your son is not my business.
Wuthering Heights,you are very stiff    said heathcliff     i know that  but you   ll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.
Wuthering Heights,come  then  my hero.
Wuthering Heights,are you willing to return  escorted by me     he approached once more  and made as if he would seize the fragile being  but  shrinking back  linton clung to his cousin  and implored her to accompany him  with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.
Wuthering Heights,however i disapproved  i couldn   t hinder her  indeed  how could she have refused him herself  what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning  but there he was  powerless under its gripe  and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy.
Wuthering Heights,we reached the threshold  catherine walked in  and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair  expecting her out immediately  when mr. heathcliff  pushing me forward  exclaimed      my house is not stricken with the plague  nelly  and i have a mind to be hospitable to day  sit down  and allow me to shut the door.
Wuthering Heights,he shut and locked it also.
Wuthering Heights,i started.
Wuthering Heights,you shall have tea before you go home    he added.
Wuthering Heights,i am by myself.
Wuthering Heights,hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees  and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure  and  though i   m used to being alone  i   d rather have some interesting company  if i can get it.
Wuthering Heights,miss linton  take your seat by him.
Wuthering Heights,i give you what i have  the present is hardly worth accepting  but i have nothing else to offer.
Wuthering Heights,it is linton  i mean.
Wuthering Heights,how she does stare  it   s odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me  had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty  i should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two  as an evening   s amusement.
Wuthering Heights,he drew in his breath  struck the table  and swore to himself     by hell  i hate them.
Wuthering Heights,i am not afraid of you    exclaimed catherine  who could not hear the latter part of his speech.
Wuthering Heights,she stepped close up  her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution.
Wuthering Heights,give me that key  i will have it    she said.
Wuthering Heights,i wouldn   t eat or drink here  if i were starving.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.
Wuthering Heights,he looked up  seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness  or  possibly  reminded  by her voice and glance  of the person from whom she inherited it.
Wuthering Heights,she snatched at the instrument  and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers  but her action recalled him to the present  he recovered it speedily.
Wuthering Heights,now  catherine linton    he said     stand off  or i shall knock you down  and that will make mrs. dean mad.
Wuthering Heights,regardless of this warning  she captured his closed hand and its contents again.
Wuthering Heights,we will go    she repeated  exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax  and finding that her nails made no impression  she applied her teeth pretty sharply.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.
Wuthering Heights,catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face.
Wuthering Heights,he opened them suddenly  and resigned the object of dispute  but  ere she had well secured it  he seized her with the liberated hand  and  pulling her on his knee  administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head  each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat  had she been able to fall.
Wuthering Heights,at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously.
Wuthering Heights,you villain    i began to cry     you villain    a touch on the chest silenced me  i am stout  and soon put out of breath  and  what with that and the rage  i staggered dizzily back  and felt ready to suffocate  or to burst a blood vessel.
Wuthering Heights,the scene was over in two minutes  catherine  released  put her two hands to her temples  and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on.
Wuthering Heights,she trembled like a reed  poor thing  and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.
Wuthering Heights,i know how to chastise children  you see    said the scoundrel  grimly  as he stooped to repossess himself of the key  which had dropped to the floor.
Wuthering Heights,go to linton now  as i told you  and cry at your ease  i shall be your father  to morrow   all the father you   ll have in a few days   and you shall have plenty of that.
Wuthering Heights,you can bear plenty  you   re no weakling  you shall have a daily taste  if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again     cathy ran to me instead of linton  and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap  weeping aloud.
Wuthering Heights,her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle  as quiet as a mouse  congratulating himself  i dare say  that the correction had alighted on another than him.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  perceiving us all confounded  rose  and expeditiously made the tea himself.
Wuthering Heights,the cups and saucers were laid ready.
Wuthering Heights,he poured it out  and handed me a cup.
Wuthering Heights,wash away your spleen    he said.
Wuthering Heights,and help your own naughty pet and mine.
Wuthering Heights,it is not poisoned  though i prepared it.
Wuthering Heights,i   m going out to seek your horses.
Wuthering Heights,our first thought  on his departure  was to force an exit somewhere.
Wuthering Heights,we tried the kitchen door  but that was fastened outside  we looked at the windows   they were too narrow for even cathy   s little figure.
Wuthering Heights,master linton    i cried  seeing we were regularly imprisoned     you know what your diabolical father is after  and you shall tell us  or i   ll box your ears  as he has done your cousin   s.       yes  linton  you must tell    said catherine.
Wuthering Heights,it was for your sake i came  and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.
Wuthering Heights,give me some tea  i   m thirsty  and then i   ll tell you    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. dean  go away.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t like you standing over me.
Wuthering Heights,now  catherine  you are letting your tears fall into my cup.
Wuthering Heights,i won   t drink that.
Wuthering Heights,give me another.
Wuthering Heights,catherine pushed another to him  and wiped her face.
Wuthering Heights,i felt disgusted at the little wretch   s composure  since he was no longer in terror for himself.
Wuthering Heights,the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights  so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there  and  that accomplished  he had no further immediate fears.
Wuthering Heights,papa wants us to be married    he continued  after sipping some of the liquid.
Wuthering Heights,and he knows your papa wouldn   t let us marry now  and he   s afraid of my dying if we wait  so we are to be married in the morning  and you are to stay here all night  and  if you do as he wishes  you shall return home next day  and take me with you.
Wuthering Heights,take you with her  pitiful changeling    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,you marry  why  the man is mad  or he thinks us fools  every one.
Wuthering Heights,and do you imagine that beautiful young lady  that healthy  hearty girl  will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you  are you cherishing the notion that anybody  let alone miss catherine linton  would have you for a husband  you want whipping for bringing us in here at all  with your dastardly puling tricks  and   don   t look so silly  now  i   ve a very good mind to shake you severely  for your contemptible treachery  and your imbecile conceit.
Wuthering Heights,i did give him a slight shaking  but it brought on the cough  and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping  and catherine rebuked me.
Wuthering Heights,stay all night  no    she said  looking slowly round.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  i   ll burn that door down but i   ll get out.
Wuthering Heights,and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly  but linton was up in alarm for his dear self again.
Wuthering Heights,he clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing       won   t you have me  and save me  not let me come to the grange  oh  darling catherine  you mustn   t go and leave  after all.
Wuthering Heights,you must obey my father   you must        i must obey my own    she replied     and relieve him from this cruel suspense.
Wuthering Heights,the whole night  what would he think  he   ll be distressed already.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll either break or burn a way out of the house.
Wuthering Heights,be quiet  you   re in no danger  but if you hinder me   linton  i love papa better than you     the mortal terror he felt of mr. heathcliff   s anger restored to the boy his coward   s eloquence.
Wuthering Heights,catherine was near distraught  still  she persisted that she must go home  and tried entreaty in her turn  persuading him to subdue his selfish agony.
Wuthering Heights,while they were thus occupied  our jailor re entered.
Wuthering Heights,your beasts have trotted off    he said     and   now linton  snivelling again  what has she been doing to you  come  come   have done  and get to bed.
Wuthering Heights,in a month or two  my lad  you   ll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.
Wuthering Heights,you   re pining for pure love  are you not  nothing else in the world  and she shall have you  there  to bed  zillah won   t be here to night  you must undress yourself.
Wuthering Heights,hush  hold your noise  once in your own room  i   ll not come near you  you needn   t fear.
Wuthering Heights,by chance  you   ve managed tolerably.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll look to the rest.
Wuthering Heights,he spoke these words  holding the door open for his son to pass  and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.
Wuthering Heights,the lock was re secured.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff approached the fire  where my mistress and i stood silent.
Wuthering Heights,catherine looked up  and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek  his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.
Wuthering Heights,anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness  but he scowled on her and muttered      oh  you are not afraid of me  your courage is well disguised  you seem damnably afraid        i am afraid now    she replied     because  if i stay  papa will be miserable  and how can i endure making him miserable   when he   when he   mr. heathcliff  let me go home  i promise to marry linton  papa would like me to  and i love him.
Wuthering Heights,why should you wish to force me to do what i   ll willingly do of myself        let him dare to force you    i cried.
Wuthering Heights,there   s law in the land  thank god  there is  though we be in an out of the way place.
Wuthering Heights,i   d inform if he were my own son  and it   s felony without benefit of clergy        silence    said the ruffian.
Wuthering Heights,to the devil with your clamour  i don   t want you to speak.
Wuthering Heights,miss linton  i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable  i shall not sleep for satisfaction.
Wuthering Heights,you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty four hours than informing me that such an event would follow.
Wuthering Heights,as to your promise to marry linton  i   ll take care you shall keep it  for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.
Wuthering Heights,send ellen  then  to let papa know i   m safe    exclaimed catherine  weeping bitterly.
Wuthering Heights,or marry me now.
Wuthering Heights,poor papa  ellen  he   ll think we   re lost.
Wuthering Heights,what shall we do        not he  he   ll think you are tired of waiting on him  and run off for a little amusement    answered heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord  in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary.
Wuthering Heights,and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age  and that you would weary of nursing a sick man  and that man only your father.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  his happiest days were over when your days began.
Wuthering Heights,he cursed you  i dare say  for coming into the world  i did  at least   and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it.
Wuthering Heights,i   d join him.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t love you  how should i  weep away.
Wuthering Heights,as far as i can see  it will be your chief diversion hereafter  unless linton make amends for other losses  and your provident parent appears to fancy he may.
Wuthering Heights,his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly.
Wuthering Heights,in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his  and kind to her when he got her.
Wuthering Heights,careful and kind   that   s paternal.
Wuthering Heights,but linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.
Wuthering Heights,linton can play the little tyrant well.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll undertake to torture any number of cats  if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.
Wuthering Heights,you   ll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness  when you get home again  i assure you.
Wuthering Heights,you   re right there    i said     explain your son   s character.
Wuthering Heights,show his resemblance to yourself  and then  i hope  miss cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice        i don   t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now    he answered     because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner  and you along with her  till your master dies.
Wuthering Heights,i can detain you both  quite concealed  here.
Wuthering Heights,if you doubt  encourage her to retract her word  and you   ll have an opportunity of judging        i   ll not retract my word    said catherine.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll marry him within this hour  if i may go to thrushcross grange afterwards.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  you   re a cruel man  but you   re not a fiend  and you won   t  from mere malice  destroy irrevocably all my happiness.
Wuthering Heights,if papa thought i had left him on purpose  and if he died before i returned  could i bear to live  i   ve given over crying  but i   m going to kneel here  at your knee  and i   ll not get up  and i   ll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me  no  don   t turn away  do look  you   ll see nothing to provoke you.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t hate you.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not angry that you struck me.
Wuthering Heights,have you never loved anybody in all your life  uncle  never  ah  you must look once.
Wuthering Heights,i   m so wretched  you can   t help being sorry and pitying me.
Wuthering Heights,keep your eft   s fingers off  and move  or i   ll kick you    cried heathcliff  brutally repulsing her.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather be hugged by a snake.
Wuthering Heights,how the devil can you dream of fawning on me  i detest you     he shrugged his shoulders  shook himself  indeed  as if his flesh crept with aversion  and thrust back his chair  while i got up  and opened my mouth  to commence a downright torrent of abuse.
Wuthering Heights,but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence  by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered.
Wuthering Heights,it was growing dark   we heard a sound of voices at the garden gate.
Wuthering Heights,our host hurried out instantly  he had his wits about him  we had not.
Wuthering Heights,there was a talk of two or three minutes  and he returned alone.
Wuthering Heights,i thought it had been your cousin hareton    i observed to catherine.
Wuthering Heights,i wish he would arrive  who knows but he might take our part        it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange    said heathcliff  overhearing me.
Wuthering Heights,you should have opened a lattice and called out  but i could swear that chit is glad you didn   t. she   s glad to be obliged to stay  i   m certain.
Wuthering Heights,at learning the chance we had missed  we both gave vent to our grief without control  and he allowed us to wail on till nine o   clock.
Wuthering Heights,then he bid us go upstairs  through the kitchen  to zillah   s chamber  and i whispered my companion to obey  perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there  or into a garret  and out by its skylight.
Wuthering Heights,the window  however  was narrow  like those below  and the garret trap was safe from our attempts  for we were fastened in as before.
Wuthering Heights,we neither of us lay down  catherine took her station by the lattice  and watched anxiously for morning  a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.
Wuthering Heights,i seated myself in a chair  and rocked to and fro  passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty  from which  it struck me then  all the misfortunes of my employers sprang.
Wuthering Heights,it was not the case  in reality  i am aware  but it was  in my imagination  that dismal night  and i thought heathcliff himself less guilty than i.
Wuthering Heights,at seven o   clock he came  and inquired if miss linton had risen.
Wuthering Heights,she ran to the door immediately  and answered     yes.
Wuthering Heights,here  then    he said  opening it  and pulling her out.
Wuthering Heights,i rose to follow  but he turned the lock again.
Wuthering Heights,i demanded my release.
Wuthering Heights,be patient    he replied     i   ll send up your breakfast in a while.
Wuthering Heights,i thumped on the panels  and rattled the latch angrily  and catherine asked why i was still shut up  he answered  i must try to endure it another hour  and they went away.
Wuthering Heights,i endured it two or three hours  at length  i heard a footstep  not heathcliff   s.     i   ve brought you something to eat    said a voice     oppen t    door     complying eagerly  i beheld hareton  laden with food enough to last me all day.
Wuthering Heights,tak    it    he added  thrusting the tray into my hand.
Wuthering Heights,stay one minute    i began.
Wuthering Heights,nay    cried he  and retired  regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him.
Wuthering Heights,and there i remained enclosed the whole day  and the whole of the next night  and another  and another.
Wuthering Heights,five nights and four days i remained  altogether  seeing nobody but hareton once every morning  and he was a model of a jailor  surly  and dumb  and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion.
Wuthering Heights,on the fifth morning  or rather afternoon  a different step approached   lighter and shorter  and  this time  the person entered the room.
Wuthering Heights,it was zillah  donned in her scarlet shawl  with a black silk bonnet on her head  and a willow basket swung to her arm.
Wuthering Heights,eh  dear  mrs. dean    she exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,well  there is a talk about you at gimmerton.
Wuthering Heights,i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh  and missy with you  till master told me you   d been found  and he   d lodged you here  what  and you must have got on an island  sure  and how long were you in the hole  did master save you  mrs. dean  but you   re not so thin   you   ve not been so poorly  have you        your master is a true scoundrel    i replied.
Wuthering Heights,but he shall answer for it.
Wuthering Heights,he needn   t have raised that tale  it shall all be laid bare        what do you mean    asked zillah.
Wuthering Heights,it   s not his tale  they tell that in the village   about your being lost in the marsh  and i calls to earnshaw  when i come in      eh  they   s queer things  mr. hareton  happened since i went off.
Wuthering Heights,it   s a sad pity of that likely young lass  and cant nelly dean.
Wuthering Heights,he stared.
Wuthering Heights,i thought he had not heard aught  so i told him the rumour.
Wuthering Heights,the master listened  and he just smiled to himself  and said     if they have been in the marsh  they are out now  zillah.
Wuthering Heights,nelly dean is lodged  at this minute  in your room.
Wuthering Heights,you can tell her to flit  when you go up  here is the key.
Wuthering Heights,the bog water got into her head  and she would have run home quite flighty  but i fixed her till she came round to her senses.
Wuthering Heights,you can bid her go to the grange at once  if she be able  and carry a message from me  that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire   s funeral.
Wuthering Heights,mr. edgar is not dead    i gasped.
Wuthering Heights,oh  zillah  zillah        no  no  sit you down  my good mistress    she replied     you   re right sickly yet.
Wuthering Heights,he   s not dead  doctor kenneth thinks he may last another day.
Wuthering Heights,i met him on the road and asked.
Wuthering Heights,instead of sitting down  i snatched my outdoor things  and hastened below  for the way was free.
Wuthering Heights,on entering the house  i looked about for some one to give information of catherine.
Wuthering Heights,the place was filled with sunshine  and the door stood wide open  but nobody seemed at hand.
Wuthering Heights,as i hesitated whether to go off at once  or return and seek my mistress  a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,linton lay on the settle  sole tenant  sucking a stick of sugar candy  and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes.
Wuthering Heights,where is miss catherine    i demanded sternly  supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence  by catching him thus  alone.
Wuthering Heights,he sucked on like an innocent.
Wuthering Heights,is she gone    i said.
Wuthering Heights,no    he replied     she   s upstairs  she   s not to go  we won   t let her.
Wuthering Heights,you won   t let her  little idiot    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,direct me to her room immediately  or i   ll make you sing out sharply.
Wuthering Heights,papa would make you sing out  if you attempted to get there    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,he says i   m not to be soft with catherine  she   s my wife  and it   s shameful that she should wish to leave me.
Wuthering Heights,he says she hates me and wants me to die  that she may have my money  but she shan   t have it  and she shan   t go home  she never shall    she may cry  and be sick as much as she pleases     he resumed his former occupation  closing his lids  as if he meant to drop asleep.
Wuthering Heights,master heathcliff    i resumed     have you forgotten all catherine   s kindness to you last winter  when you affirmed you loved her  and when she brought you books and sung you songs  and came many a time through wind and snow to see you  she wept to miss one evening  because you would be disappointed  and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you  and now you believe the lies your father tells  though you know he detests you both.
Wuthering Heights,and you join him against her.
Wuthering Heights,that   s fine gratitude  is it not     the corner of linton   s mouth fell  and he took the sugar candy from his lips.
Wuthering Heights,did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,think for yourself  as to your money  she does not even know that you will have any.
Wuthering Heights,and you say she   s sick  and yet you leave her alone  up there in a strange house  you who have felt what it is to be so neglected  you could pity your own sufferings  and she pitied them  too  but you won   t pity hers  i shed tears  master heathcliff  you see   an elderly woman  and a servant merely   and you  after pretending such affection  and having reason to worship her almost  store every tear you have for yourself  and lie there quite at ease.
Wuthering Heights,ah  you   re a heartless  selfish boy        i can   t stay with her    he answered crossly.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll not stay by myself.
Wuthering Heights,she cries so i can   t bear it.
Wuthering Heights,and she won   t give over  though i say i   ll call my father.
Wuthering Heights,i did call him once  and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet  but she began again the instant he left the room  moaning and grieving all night long  though i screamed for vexation that i couldn   t sleep.
Wuthering Heights,is mr. heathcliff out    i inquired  perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin   s mental tortures.
Wuthering Heights,he   s in the court    he replied     talking to doctor kenneth  who says uncle is dying  truly  at last.
Wuthering Heights,i   m glad  for i shall be master of the grange after him.
Wuthering Heights,catherine always spoke of it as her house.
Wuthering Heights,it isn   t hers  it   s mine  papa says everything she has is mine.
Wuthering Heights,all her nice books are mine  she offered to give me them  and her pretty birds  and her pony minny  if i would get the key of our room  and let her out  but i told her she had nothing to give  they were all  all mine.
Wuthering Heights,and then she cried  and took a little picture from her neck  and said i should have that  two pictures in a gold case  on one side her mother  and on the other uncle  when they were young.
Wuthering Heights,that was yesterday   i said they were mine  too  and tried to get them from her.
Wuthering Heights,the spiteful thing wouldn   t let me  she pushed me off  and hurt me.
Wuthering Heights,i shrieked out   that frightens her   she heard papa coming  and she broke the hinges and divided the case  and gave me her mother   s portrait  the other she attempted to hide  but papa asked what was the matter  and i explained it.
Wuthering Heights,he took the one i had away  and ordered her to resign hers to me  she refused  and he   he struck her down  and wrenched it off the chain  and crushed it with his foot.
Wuthering Heights,and were you pleased to see her struck    i asked  having my designs in encouraging his talk.
Wuthering Heights,i winked    he answered     i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse  he does it so hard.
Wuthering Heights,yet i was glad at first   she deserved punishing for pushing me  but when papa was gone  she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside  against her teeth  and her mouth filling with blood  and then she gathered up the bits of the picture  and went and sat down with her face to the wall  and she has never spoken to me since  and i sometimes think she can   t speak for pain.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t like to think so  but she   s a naughty thing for crying continually  and she looks so pale and wild  i   m afraid of her.
Wuthering Heights,and you can get the key if you choose    i said.
Wuthering Heights,yes  when i am upstairs    he answered     but i can   t walk upstairs now.
Wuthering Heights,in what apartment is it    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,oh    he cried     i shan   t tell you where it is.
Wuthering Heights,it is our secret.
Wuthering Heights,nobody  neither hareton nor zillah  is to know.
Wuthering Heights,there  you   ve tired me   go away  go away    and he turned his face on to his arm  and shut his eyes again.
Wuthering Heights,i considered it best to depart without seeing mr. heathcliff  and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange.
Wuthering Heights,on reaching it  the astonishment of my fellow servants to see me  and their joy also  was intense  and when they heard that their little mistress was safe  two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr. edgar   s door  but i bespoke the announcement of it myself.
Wuthering Heights,how changed i found him  even in those few days  he lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death.
Wuthering Heights,very young he looked  though his actual age was thirty nine  one would have called him ten years younger  at least.
Wuthering Heights,he thought of catherine  for he murmured her name.
Wuthering Heights,i touched his hand  and spoke.
Wuthering Heights,catherine is coming  dear master    i whispered     she is alive and well  and will be here  i hope  to night.
Wuthering Heights,i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence  he half rose up  looked eagerly round the apartment  and then sank back in a swoon.
Wuthering Heights,as soon as he recovered  i related our compulsory visit  and detention at the heights.
Wuthering Heights,i said heathcliff forced me to go in  which was not quite true.
Wuthering Heights,i uttered as little as possible against linton  nor did i describe all his father   s brutal conduct   my intentions being to add no bitterness  if i could help it  to his already overflowing cup.
Wuthering Heights,he divined that one of his enemy   s purposes was to secure the personal property  as well as the estate  to his son  or rather himself  yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master  because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.
Wuthering Heights,however  he felt that his will had better be altered  instead of leaving catherine   s fortune at her own disposal  he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life  and for her children  if she had any  after her.
Wuthering Heights,by that means  it could not fall to mr. heathcliff should linton die.
Wuthering Heights,having received his orders  i despatched a man to fetch the attorney  and four more  provided with serviceable weapons  to demand my young lady of her jailor.
Wuthering Heights,both parties were delayed very late.
Wuthering Heights,the single servant returned first.
Wuthering Heights,he said mr. green  the lawyer  was out when he arrived at his house  and he had to wait two hours for his re entrance  and then mr. green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done  but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning.
Wuthering Heights,the four men came back unaccompanied also.
Wuthering Heights,they brought word that catherine was ill  too ill to quit her room  and heathcliff would not suffer them to see her.
Wuthering Heights,i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale  which i would not carry to my master  resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights  at daylight  and storm it literally  unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us.
Wuthering Heights,her father shall see her  i vowed  and vowed again  if that devil be killed on his own door stones in trying to prevent it   happily  i was spared the journey and the trouble.
Wuthering Heights,i had gone downstairs at three o   clock to fetch a jug of water  and was passing through the hall with it in my hand  when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump.
Wuthering Heights,oh  it is green    i said  recollecting myself      only green    and i went on  intending to send somebody else to open it  but the knock was repeated  not loud  and still importunately.
Wuthering Heights,i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.
Wuthering Heights,the harvest moon shone clear outside.
Wuthering Heights,it was not the attorney.
Wuthering Heights,my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing     ellen  ellen  is papa alive        yes    i cried     yes  my angel  he is  god be thanked  you are safe with us again     she wanted to run  breathless as she was  upstairs to mr. linton   s room  but i compelled her to sit down on a chair  and made her drink  and washed her pale face  chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.
Wuthering Heights,then i said i must go first  and tell of her arrival  imploring her to say  she should be happy with young heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,she stared  but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood  she assured me she would not complain.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t abide to be present at their meeting.
Wuthering Heights,i stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour  and hardly ventured near the bed  then.
Wuthering Heights,all was composed  however  catherine   s despair was as silent as her father   s joy.
Wuthering Heights,she supported him calmly  in appearance  and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.
Wuthering Heights,he died blissfully  mr. lockwood  he died so.
Wuthering Heights,kissing her cheek  he murmured       i am going to her  and you  darling child  shall come to us    and never stirred or spoke again  but continued that rapt  radiant gaze  till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.
Wuthering Heights,none could have noticed the exact minute of his death  it was so entirely without a struggle.
Wuthering Heights,whether catherine had spent her tears  or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow  she sat there dry eyed till the sun rose  she sat till noon  and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed  but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.
Wuthering Heights,it was well i succeeded in removing her  for at dinner time appeared the lawyer  having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave.
Wuthering Heights,he had sold himself to mr. heathcliff  that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master   s summons.
Wuthering Heights,fortunately  no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter   s mind  to disturb him  after his daughter   s arrival.
Wuthering Heights,mr. green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place.
Wuthering Heights,he gave all the servants but me  notice to quit.
Wuthering Heights,he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar linton should not be buried beside his wife  but in the chapel  with his family.
Wuthering Heights,there was the will  however  to hinder that  and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions.
Wuthering Heights,the funeral was hurried over  catherine  mrs. linton heathcliff now  was suffered to stay at the grange till her father   s corpse had quitted it.
Wuthering Heights,she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk of liberating her.
Wuthering Heights,she heard the men i sent disputing at the door  and she gathered the sense of heathcliff   s answer.
Wuthering Heights,it drove her desperate.
Wuthering Heights,linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left  was terrified into fetching the key before his father re ascended.
Wuthering Heights,he had the cunning to unlock and re lock the door  without shutting it  and when he should have gone to bed  he begged to sleep with hareton  and his petition was granted for once.
Wuthering Heights,catherine stole out before break of day.
Wuthering Heights,she dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm  she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows  and  luckily  lighting on her mother   s  she got easily out of its lattice  and on to the ground  by means of the fir tree close by.
Wuthering Heights,her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape  notwithstanding his timid contrivances.
Wuthering Heights,the evening after the funeral  my young lady and i were seated in the library  now musing mournfully   one of us despairingly   on our loss  now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.
Wuthering Heights,we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the grange  at least during linton   s life  he being allowed to join her there  and i to remain as housekeeper.
Wuthering Heights,that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for  and yet i did hope  and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment  and  above all  my beloved young mistress  when a servant   one of the discarded ones  not yet departed   rushed hastily in  and said    that devil heathcliff   was coming through the court  should he fasten the door in his face   if we had been mad enough to order that proceeding  we had not time.
Wuthering Heights,he made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name  he was master  and availed himself of the master   s privilege to walk straight in  without saying a word.
Wuthering Heights,the sound of our informant   s voice directed him to the library  he entered and motioning him out  shut the door.
Wuthering Heights,it was the same room into which he had been ushered  as a guest  eighteen years before  the same moon shone through the window  and the same autumn landscape lay outside.
Wuthering Heights,we had not yet lighted a candle  but all the apartment was visible  even to the portraits on the wall  the splendid head of mrs. linton  and the graceful one of her husband.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff advanced to the hearth.
Wuthering Heights,time had little altered his person either.
Wuthering Heights,there was the same man  his dark face rather sallower and more composed  his frame a stone or two heavier  perhaps  and no other difference.
Wuthering Heights,catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out  when she saw him.
Wuthering Heights,stop    he said  arresting her by the arm.
Wuthering Heights,no more runnings away  where would you go  i   m come to fetch you home  and i hope you   ll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.
Wuthering Heights,i was embarrassed how to punish him when i discovered his part in the business  he   s such a cobweb  a pinch would annihilate him  but you   ll see by his look that he has received his due  i brought him down one evening  the day before yesterday  and just set him in a chair  and never touched him afterwards.
Wuthering Heights,i sent hareton out  and we had the room to ourselves.
Wuthering Heights,in two hours  i called joseph to carry him up again  and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost  and i fancy he sees me often  though i am not near.
Wuthering Heights,hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together  and calls you to protect him from me  and  whether you like your precious mate  or not  you must come  he   s your concern now  i yield all my interest in him to you.
Wuthering Heights,why not let catherine continue here    i pleaded     and send master linton to her  as you hate them both  you   d not miss them  they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.
Wuthering Heights,i   m seeking a tenant for the grange    he answered     and i want my children about me  to be sure.
Wuthering Heights,besides  that lass owes me her services for her bread.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after linton is gone.
Wuthering Heights,make haste and get ready  now  and don   t oblige me to compel you.
Wuthering Heights,i shall    said catherine.
Wuthering Heights,linton is all i have to love in the world  and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me  and me to him  you cannot make us hate each other.
Wuthering Heights,and i defy you to hurt him when i am by  and i defy you to frighten me        you are a boastful champion    replied heathcliff     but i don   t like you well enough to hurt him  you shall get the full benefit of the torment  as long as it lasts.
Wuthering Heights,it is not i who will make him hateful to you   it is his own sweet spirit.
Wuthering Heights,he   s as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences  don   t expect thanks for this noble devotion.
Wuthering Heights,i heard him draw a pleasant picture to zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as i  the inclination is there  and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.
Wuthering Heights,i know he has a bad nature    said catherine     he   s your son.
Wuthering Heights,but i   m glad i   ve a better  to forgive it  and i know he loves me  and for that reason i love him.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  you have nobody to love you  and  however miserable you make us  we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.
Wuthering Heights,you are miserable  are you not  lonely  like the devil  and envious like him  nobody loves you   nobody will cry for you when you die  i wouldn   t be you     catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph  she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family  and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.
Wuthering Heights,you shall be sorry to be yourself presently    said her father in law     if you stand there another minute.
Wuthering Heights,begone  witch  and get your things     she scornfully withdrew.
Wuthering Heights,in her absence i began to beg for zillah   s place at the heights  offering to resign mine to her  but he would suffer it on no account.
Wuthering Heights,he bid me be silent  and then  for the first time  allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
Wuthering Heights,having studied mrs. linton   s  he said      i shall have that home.
Wuthering Heights,not because i need it  but      he turned abruptly to the fire  and continued  with what  for lack of a better word  i must call a smile      i   ll tell you what i did yesterday  i got the sexton  who was digging linton   s grave  to remove the earth off her coffin lid  and i opened it.
Wuthering Heights,i thought  once  i would have stayed there  when i saw her face again   it is hers yet    he had hard work to stir me  but he said it would change if the air blew on it  and so i struck one side of the coffin loose  and covered it up  not linton   s side  damn him  i wish he   d been soldered in lead.
Wuthering Heights,and i bribed the sexton to pull it away when i   m laid there  and slide mine out too  i   ll have it made so  and then by the time linton gets to us he   ll not know which is which        you were very wicked  mr. heathcliff    i exclaimed     were you not ashamed to disturb the dead        i disturbed nobody  nelly    he replied     and i gave some ease to myself.
Wuthering Heights,i shall be a great deal more comfortable now  and you   ll have a better chance of keeping me underground  when i get there.
Wuthering Heights,disturbed her  no  she has disturbed me  night and day  through eighteen years   incessantly   remorselessly   till yesternight  and yesternight i was tranquil.
Wuthering Heights,i dreamt i was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper  with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.
Wuthering Heights,and if she had been dissolved into earth  or worse  what would you have dreamt of then    i said.
Wuthering Heights,of dissolving with her  and being more happy still    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,do you suppose i dread any change of that sort  i expected such a transformation on raising the lid  but i   m better pleased that it should not commence till i share it.
Wuthering Heights,besides  unless i had received a distinct impression of her passionless features  that strange feeling would hardly have been removed.
Wuthering Heights,it began oddly.
Wuthering Heights,you know i was wild after she died  and eternally  from dawn to dawn  praying her to return to me her spirit  i have a strong faith in ghosts  i have a conviction that they can  and do  exist among us  the day she was buried  there came a fall of snow.
Wuthering Heights,in the evening i went to the churchyard.
Wuthering Heights,it blew bleak as winter   all round was solitary.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late  and no one else had business to bring them there.
Wuthering Heights,being alone  and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us  i said to myself      i   ll have her in my arms again  if she be cold  i   ll think it is this north wind that chills me  and if she be motionless  it is sleep.
Wuthering Heights,i got a spade from the tool house  and began to delve with all my might   it scraped the coffin  i fell to work with my hands  the wood commenced cracking about the screws  i was on the point of attaining my object  when it seemed that i heard a sigh from some one above  close at the edge of the grave  and bending down.
Wuthering Heights,if i can only get this off     i muttered     i wish they may shovel in the earth over us both     and i wrenched at it more desperately still.
Wuthering Heights,there was another sigh  close at my ear.
Wuthering Heights,i appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet laden wind.
Wuthering Heights,i knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by  but  as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark  though it cannot be discerned  so certainly i felt that cathy was there  not under me  but on the earth.
Wuthering Heights,a sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.
Wuthering Heights,i relinquished my labour of agony  and turned consoled at once  unspeakably consoled.
Wuthering Heights,her presence was with me  it remained while i re filled the grave  and led me home.
Wuthering Heights,you may laugh  if you will  but i was sure i should see her there.
Wuthering Heights,i was sure she was with me  and i could not help talking to her.
Wuthering Heights,having reached the heights  i rushed eagerly to the door.
Wuthering Heights,it was fastened  and  i remember  that accursed earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance.
Wuthering Heights,i remember stopping to kick the breath out of him  and then hurrying upstairs  to my room and hers.
Wuthering Heights,i looked round impatiently   i felt her by me   i could almost see her  and yet i could not  i ought to have sweat blood then  from the anguish of my yearning   from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse  i had not one.
Wuthering Heights,she showed herself  as she often was in life  a devil to me  and  since then  sometimes more and sometimes less  i   ve been the sport of that intolerable torture  infernal  keeping my nerves at such a stretch that  if they had not resembled catgut  they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of linton   s. when i sat in the house with hareton  it seemed that on going out i should meet her  when i walked on the moors i should meet her coming in.
Wuthering Heights,when i went from home i hastened to return  she must be somewhere at the heights  i was certain  and when i slept in her chamber   i was beaten out of that.
Wuthering Heights,i couldn   t lie there  for the moment i closed my eyes  she was either outside the window  or sliding back the panels  or entering the room  or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child  and i must open my lids to see.
Wuthering Heights,and so i opened and closed them a hundred times a night   to be always disappointed  it racked me  i   ve often groaned aloud  till that old rascal joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me.
Wuthering Heights,now  since i   ve seen her  i   m pacified   a little.
Wuthering Heights,it was a strange way of killing  not by inches  but by fractions of hairbreadths  to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years     mr. heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead  his hair clung to it  wet with perspiration  his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire  the brows not contracted  but raised next the temples  diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance  but imparting a peculiar look of trouble  and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.
Wuthering Heights,he only half addressed me  and i maintained silence.
Wuthering Heights,i didn   t like to hear him talk  after a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture  took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage  and while so occupied catherine entered  announcing that she was ready  when her pony should be saddled.
Wuthering Heights,send that over to morrow    said heathcliff to me  then turning to her  he added     you may do without your pony  it is a fine evening  and you   ll need no ponies at wuthering heights  for what journeys you take  your own feet will serve you.
Wuthering Heights,come along.
Wuthering Heights,good bye  ellen    whispered my dear little mistress.
Wuthering Heights,as she kissed me  her lips felt like ice.
Wuthering Heights,come and see me  ellen  don   t forget.
Wuthering Heights,take care you do no such thing  mrs. dean    said her new father.
Wuthering Heights,when i wish to speak to you i   ll come here.
Wuthering Heights,i want none of your prying at my house     he signed her to precede him  and casting back a look that cut my heart  she obeyed.
Wuthering Heights,i watched them  from the window  walk down the garden.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff fixed catherine   s arm under his  though she disputed the act at first evidently  and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley  whose trees concealed them.
Wuthering Heights,i have paid a visit to the heights  but i have not seen her since she left  joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her  and wouldn   t let me pass.
Wuthering Heights,he said mrs. linton was    thrang    and the master was not in.
Wuthering Heights,zillah has told me something of the way they go on  otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living.
Wuthering Heights,she thinks catherine haughty  and does not like her  i can guess by her talk.
Wuthering Heights,my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came  but mr. heathcliff told her to follow her own business  and let his daughter in law look after herself  and zillah willingly acquiesced  being a narrow minded  selfish woman.
Wuthering Heights,catherine evinced a child   s annoyance at this neglect  repaid it with contempt  and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies  as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.
Wuthering Heights,i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago  a little before you came  one day when we foregathered on the moor  and this is what she told me.
Wuthering Heights,the first thing mrs. linton did    she said     on her arrival at the heights  was to run upstairs  without even wishing good evening to me and joseph  she shut herself into linton   s room  and remained till morning.
Wuthering Heights,then  while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast  she entered the house  and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for  her cousin was very ill.        we know that     answered heathcliff     but his life is not worth a farthing  and i won   t spend a farthing on him.
Wuthering Heights,but i cannot tell how to do     she said     and if nobody will help me  he   ll die            walk out of the room     cried the master     and let me never hear a word more about him  none here care what becomes of him  if you do  act the nurse  if you do not  lock him up and leave him.
Wuthering Heights,then she began to bother me  and i said i   d had enough plague with the tiresome thing  we each had our tasks  and hers was to wait on linton  mr. heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.
Wuthering Heights,how they managed together  i can   t tell.
Wuthering Heights,i fancy he fretted a great deal  and moaned hisseln night and day  and she had precious little rest  one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.
Wuthering Heights,she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like  and looked as if she would fain beg assistance  but i was not going to disobey the master  i never dare disobey him  mrs. dean  and  though i thought it wrong that kenneth should not be sent for  it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain  and i always refused to meddle.
Wuthering Heights,once or twice  after we had gone to bed  i   ve happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs    top  and then i   ve shut myself in quick  for fear of being moved to interfere.
Wuthering Heights,i did pity her then  i   m sure  still i didn   t wish to lose my place  you know.
Wuthering Heights,at last  one night she came boldly into my chamber  and frightened me out of my wits  by saying     tell mr. heathcliff that his son is dying   i   m sure he is  this time.
Wuthering Heights,get up  instantly  and tell him.
Wuthering Heights,having uttered this speech  she vanished again.
Wuthering Heights,i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling.
Wuthering Heights,nothing stirred   the house was quiet.
Wuthering Heights,she   s mistaken  i said to myself.
Wuthering Heights,he   s got over it.
Wuthering Heights,i needn   t disturb them  and i began to doze.
Wuthering Heights,but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell   the only bell we have  put up on purpose for linton  and the master called to me to see what was the matter  and inform them that he wouldn   t have that noise repeated.
Wuthering Heights,i delivered catherine   s message.
Wuthering Heights,he cursed to himself  and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle  and proceeded to their room.
Wuthering Heights,i followed.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff was seated by the bedside  with her hands folded on her knees.
Wuthering Heights,her father in law went up  held the light to linton   s face  looked at him  and touched him  afterwards he turned to her.
Wuthering Heights,now   catherine     he said     how do you feel         she was dumb.
Wuthering Heights,how do you feel  catherine     he repeated.
Wuthering Heights,he   s safe  and i   m free     she answered     i should feel well   but     she continued  with a bitterness she couldn   t conceal     you have left me so long to struggle against death alone  that i feel and see only death  i feel like death         and she looked like it  too  i gave her a little wine.
Wuthering Heights,hareton and joseph  who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet  and heard our talk from outside  now entered.
Wuthering Heights,joseph was fain  i believe  of the lad   s removal  hareton seemed a thought bothered  though he was more taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton.
Wuthering Heights,but the master bid him get off to bed again  we didn   t want his help.
Wuthering Heights,he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber  and told me to return to mine  and mrs. heathcliff remained by herself.
Wuthering Heights,in the morning  he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast  she had undressed  and appeared going to sleep  and said she was ill  at which i hardly wondered.
Wuthering Heights,i informed mr. heathcliff  and he replied       well  let her be till after the funeral  and go up now and then to get her what is needful  and  as soon as she seems better  tell me.
Wuthering Heights,cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight  according to zillah  who visited her twice a day  and would have been rather more friendly  but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff went up once  to show her linton   s will.
Wuthering Heights,he had bequeathed the whole of his  and what had been her  moveable property  to his father  the poor creature was threatened  or coaxed  into that act during her week   s absence  when his uncle died.
Wuthering Heights,the lands  being a minor  he could not meddle with.
Wuthering Heights,however  mr. heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wife   s right and his also  i suppose legally  at any rate  catherine  destitute of cash and friends  cannot disturb his possession.
Wuthering Heights,nobody    said zillah     ever approached her door  except that once  but i  and nobody asked anything about her.
Wuthering Heights,the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon.
Wuthering Heights,she had cried out  when i carried up her dinner  that she couldn   t bear any longer being in the cold  and i told her the master was going to thrushcross grange  and earnshaw and i needn   t hinder her from descending  so  as soon as she heard heathcliff   s horse trot off  she made her appearance  donned in black  and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker  she couldn   t comb them out.
Wuthering Heights,joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays    the kirk   you know  has no minister now  explained mrs. dean  and they call the methodists    or baptists    place  i can   t say which it is  at gimmerton  a chapel.
Wuthering Heights,joseph had gone    she continued     but i thought proper to bide at home.
Wuthering Heights,young folks are always the better for an elder   s over looking  and hareton  with all his bashfulness  isn   t a model of nice behaviour.
Wuthering Heights,i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us  and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected  so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone  while she stayed.
Wuthering Heights,he coloured up at the news  and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.
Wuthering Heights,the train oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.
Wuthering Heights,i saw he meant to give her his company  and i guessed  by his way  he wanted to be presentable  so  laughing  as i durst not laugh when the master is by  i offered to help him  if he would  and joked at his confusion.
Wuthering Heights,he grew sullen  and began to swear.
Wuthering Heights,now  mrs. dean    zillah went on  seeing me not pleased by her manner     you happen think your young lady too fine for mr. hareton  and happen you   re right  but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower.
Wuthering Heights,and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her  now  she   s as poor as you or i  poorer  i   ll be bound  you   re saving  and i   m doing my little all that road.
Wuthering Heights,hareton allowed zillah to give him her aid  and she flattered him into a good humour  so  when catherine came  half forgetting her former insults  he tried to make himself agreeable  by the housekeeper   s account.
Wuthering Heights,missis walked in    she said     as chill as an icicle  and as high as a princess.
Wuthering Heights,i got up and offered her my seat in the arm chair.
Wuthering Heights,no  she turned up her nose at my civility.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw rose  too  and bid her come to the settle  and sit close by the fire  he was sure she was starved.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve been starved a month and more     she answered  resting on the word as scornful as she could.
Wuthering Heights,and she got a chair for herself  and placed it at a distance from both of us.
Wuthering Heights,having sat till she was warm  she began to look round  and discovered a number of books on the dresser  she was instantly upon her feet again  stretching to reach them  but they were too high up.
Wuthering Heights,her cousin  after watching her endeavours a while  at last summoned courage to help her  she held her frock  and he filled it with the first that came to hand.
Wuthering Heights,that was a great advance for the lad.
Wuthering Heights,she didn   t thank him  still  he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance  and ventured to stand behind as she examined them  and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained  nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger  he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book.
Wuthering Heights,she continued reading  or seeking for something to read.
Wuthering Heights,his attention became  by degrees  quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls  her face he couldn   t see  and she couldn   t see him.
Wuthering Heights,and  perhaps  not quite awake to what he did  but attracted like a child to a candle  at last he proceeded from staring to touching  he put out his hand and stroked one curl  as gently as if it were a bird.
Wuthering Heights,he might have stuck a knife into her neck  she started round in such a taking.
Wuthering Heights,get away this moment  how dare you touch me  why are you stopping there     she cried  in a tone of disgust.
Wuthering Heights,i can   t endure you  i   ll go upstairs again  if you come near me.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hareton recoiled  looking as foolish as he could do  he sat down in the settle very quiet  and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour  finally  earnshaw crossed over  and whispered to me.
Wuthering Heights,will you ask her to read to us  zillah  i   m stalled of doing naught  and i do like   i could like to hear her  dunnot say i wanted it  but ask of yourseln.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hareton wishes you would read to us  ma   am     i said  immediately.
Wuthering Heights,he   d take it very kind   he   d be much obliged.
Wuthering Heights,she frowned  and looking up  answered           mr. hareton  and the whole set of you  will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer  i despise you  and will have nothing to say to any of you  when i would have given my life for one kind word  even to see one of your faces  you all kept off.
Wuthering Heights,but i won   t complain to you  i   m driven down here by the cold  not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.
Wuthering Heights,what could i ha    done     began earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,how was i to blame            oh  you are an exception     answered mrs. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i never missed such a concern as you.
Wuthering Heights,but i offered more than once  and asked     he said  kindling up at her pertness     i asked mr. heathcliff to let me wake for you              be silent  i   ll go out of doors  or anywhere  rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear     said my lady.
Wuthering Heights,hareton muttered she might go to hell  for him  and unslinging his gun  restrained himself from his sunday occupations no longer.
Wuthering Heights,he talked now  freely enough  and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude  but the frost had set in  and  in spite of her pride  she was forced to condescend to our company  more and more.
Wuthering Heights,however  i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature  ever since  i   ve been as stiff as herself  and she has no lover or liker among us  and she does not deserve one  for  let them say the least word to her  and she   ll curl back without respect of any one.
Wuthering Heights,she   ll snap at the master himself  and as good as dares him to thrash her  and the more hurt she gets  the more venomous she grows.
Wuthering Heights,at first  on hearing this account from zillah  i determined to leave my situation  take a cottage  and get catherine to come and live with me  but mr. heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton in an independent house  and i can see no remedy  at present  unless she could marry again  and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange.
Wuthering Heights,thus ended mrs. dean   s story.
Wuthering Heights,notwithstanding the doctor   s prophecy  i am rapidly recovering strength  and though it be only the second week in january  i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two  and riding over to wuthering heights  to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london  and  if he likes  he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october.
Wuthering Heights,i would not pass another winter here for much.
Wuthering Heights,yesterday was bright  calm  and frosty.
Wuthering Heights,i went to the heights as i proposed  my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady  and i did not refuse  for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request.
Wuthering Heights,the front door stood open  but the jealous gate was fastened  as at my last visit  i knocked and invoked earnshaw from among the garden beds  he unchained it  and i entered.
Wuthering Heights,the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.
Wuthering Heights,i took particular notice of him this time  but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.
Wuthering Heights,i asked if mr. heathcliff were at home  he answered  no  but he would be in at dinner time.
Wuthering Heights,it was eleven o   clock  and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him  at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me  in the office of watchdog  not as a substitute for the host.
Wuthering Heights,we entered together  catherine was there  making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal  she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first.
Wuthering Heights,she hardly raised her eyes to notice me  and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before  never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment.
Wuthering Heights,she does not seem so amiable    i thought     as mrs. dean would persuade me to believe.
Wuthering Heights,she   s a beauty  it is true  but not an angel.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,remove them yourself    she said  pushing them from her as soon as she had done  and retiring to a stool by the window  where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap.
Wuthering Heights,i approached her  pretending to desire a view of the garden  and  as i fancied  adroitly dropped mrs. dean   s note on to her knee  unnoticed by hareton   but she asked aloud     what is that    and chucked it off.
Wuthering Heights,a letter from your old acquaintance  the housekeeper at the grange    i answered  annoyed at her exposing my kind deed  and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own.
Wuthering Heights,she would gladly have gathered it up at this information  but hareton beat her  he seized and put it in his waistcoat  saying mr. heathcliff should look at it first.
Wuthering Heights,thereat  catherine silently turned her face from us  and  very stealthily  drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes  and her cousin  after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings  pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her  as ungraciously as he could.
Wuthering Heights,catherine caught and perused it eagerly  then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates  rational and irrational  of her former home  and gazing towards the hills  murmured in soliloquy      i should like to be riding minny down there  i should like to be climbing up there  oh  i   m tired   i   m stalled  hareton    and she leant her pretty head back against the sill  with half a yawn and half a sigh  and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness  neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. heathcliff    i said  after sitting some time mute     you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours  so intimate that i think it strange you won   t come and speak to me.
Wuthering Heights,my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you  and she   ll be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you  except that you received her letter and said nothing     she appeared to wonder at this speech  and asked         does ellen like you        yes  very well    i replied  hesitatingly.
Wuthering Heights,you must tell her    she continued     that i would answer her letter  but i have no materials for writing  not even a book from which i might tear a leaf.
Wuthering Heights,no books    i exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,how do you contrive to live here without them  if i may take the liberty to inquire.
Wuthering Heights,though provided with a large library  i   m frequently very dull at the grange  take my books away  and i should be desperate        i was always reading  when i had them    said catherine     and mr. heathcliff never reads  so he took it into his head to destroy my books.
Wuthering Heights,i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.
Wuthering Heights,only once  i searched through joseph   s store of theology  to his great irritation  and once  hareton  i came upon a secret stock in your room   some latin and greek  and some tales and poetry  all old friends.
Wuthering Heights,i brought the last here   and you gathered them  as a magpie gathers silver spoons  for the mere love of stealing  they are of no use to you  or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that  as you cannot enjoy them  nobody else shall.
Wuthering Heights,perhaps your envy counselled mr. heathcliff to rob me of my treasures  but i   ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart  and you cannot deprive me of those     earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations  and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge    i said  coming to his rescue.
Wuthering Heights,he is not envious  but emulous of your attainments.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll be a clever scholar in a few years.
Wuthering Heights,and he wants me to sink into a dunce  meantime    answered catherine.
Wuthering Heights,yes  i hear him trying to spell and read to himself  and pretty blunders he makes  i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday  it was extremely funny.
Wuthering Heights,i heard you  and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words  and then cursing because you couldn   t read their explanations     the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance  and then laughed at for trying to remove it.
Wuthering Heights,i had a similar notion  and  remembering mrs. dean   s anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared  i observed       but  mrs. heathcliff  we have each had a commencement  and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold  had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us  we should stumble and totter yet.
Wuthering Heights,oh    she replied     i don   t wish to limit his acquirements  still  he has no right to appropriate what is mine  and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations  those books  both prose and verse  are consecrated to me by other associations  and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth  besides  of all  he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat  as if out of deliberate malice.
Wuthering Heights,hareton   s chest heaved in silence a minute  he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath  which it was no easy task to suppress.
Wuthering Heights,i rose  and  from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment  took up my station in the doorway  surveying the external prospect as i stood.
Wuthering Heights,he followed my example  and left the room  but presently reappeared  bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands  which he threw into catherine   s lap  exclaiming       take them  i never want to hear  or read  or think of them again        i won   t have them now    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,i shall connect them with you  and hate them.
Wuthering Heights,she opened one that had obviously been often turned over  and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner  then laughed  and threw it from her.
Wuthering Heights,and listen    she continued  provokingly  commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion.
Wuthering Heights,but his self love would endure no further torment  i heard  and not altogether disapprovingly  a manual check given to her saucy tongue.
Wuthering Heights,the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin   s sensitive though uncultivated feelings  and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account  and repaying its effects on the inflictor.
Wuthering Heights,he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.
Wuthering Heights,i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.
Wuthering Heights,i fancied that as they consumed  he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted  and the triumph and ever increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them  and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also.
Wuthering Heights,he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments  till catherine crossed his path.
Wuthering Heights,shame at her scorn  and hope of her approval  were his first prompters to higher pursuits  and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other  his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result.
Wuthering Heights,yes  that   s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them    cried catherine  sucking her damaged lip  and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes.
Wuthering Heights,you   d better hold your tongue  now    he answered fiercely.
Wuthering Heights,and his agitation precluded further speech  he advanced hastily to the entrance  where i made way for him to pass.
Wuthering Heights,but ere he had crossed the door stones  mr. heathcliff  coming up the causeway  encountered him  and laying hold of his shoulder asked       what   s to do now  my lad        naught  naught    he said  and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff gazed after him  and sighed.
Wuthering Heights,it will be odd if i thwart myself    he muttered  unconscious that i was behind him.
Wuthering Heights,but when i look for his father in his face  i find her every day more  how the devil is he so like  i can hardly bear to see him.
Wuthering Heights,he bent his eyes to the ground  and walked moodily in.
Wuthering Heights,there was a restless  anxious expression in his countenance  i had never remarked there before  and he looked sparer in person.
Wuthering Heights,his daughter in law  on perceiving him through the window  immediately escaped to the kitchen  so that i remained alone.
Wuthering Heights,i   m glad to see you out of doors again  mr. lockwood    he said  in reply to my greeting     from selfish motives partly  i don   t think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve wondered more than once what brought you here.
Wuthering Heights,an idle whim  i fear  sir    was my answer     or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away.
Wuthering Heights,i shall set out for london next week  and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it.
Wuthering Heights,i believe i shall not live there any more.
Wuthering Heights,oh  indeed  you   re tired of being banished from the world  are you    he said.
Wuthering Heights,but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won   t occupy  your journey is useless  i never relent in exacting my due from any one.
Wuthering Heights,i   m coming to plead off nothing about it    i exclaimed  considerably irritated.
Wuthering Heights,should you wish it  i   ll settle with you now    and i drew my note book from my pocket.
Wuthering Heights,no  no    he replied  coolly     you   ll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts  if you fail to return  i   m not in such a hurry.
Wuthering Heights,sit down and take your dinner with us  a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  bring the things in  where are you     catherine reappeared  bearing a tray of knives and forks.
Wuthering Heights,you may get your dinner with joseph    muttered heathcliff  aside     and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.
Wuthering Heights,she obeyed his directions very punctually  perhaps she had no temptation to transgress.
Wuthering Heights,living among clowns and misanthropists  she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.
Wuthering Heights,with mr. heathcliff  grim and saturnine  on the one hand  and hareton  absolutely dumb  on the other  i made a somewhat cheerless meal  and bade adieu early.
Wuthering Heights,i would have departed by the back way  to get a last glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph  but hareton received orders to lead up my horse  and my host himself escorted me to the door  so i could not fulfil my wish.
Wuthering Heights,how dreary life gets over in that house    i reflected  while riding down the road.
Wuthering Heights,what a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs. linton heathcliff  had she and i struck up an attachment  as her good nurse desired  and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town         .
Wuthering Heights,this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north  and on my journey to his abode  i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton.
Wuthering Heights,the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses  when a cart of very green oats  newly reaped  passed by  and he remarked       yon   s frough gimmerton  nah  they   re allas three wick    after other folk wi    ther harvest.
Wuthering Heights,gimmerton    i repeated   my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy.
Wuthering Heights,ah  i know.
Wuthering Heights,how far is it from this        happen fourteen mile o   er th    hills  and a rough road    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange.
Wuthering Heights,it was scarcely noon  and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn.
Wuthering Heights,besides  i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord  and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again.
Wuthering Heights,having rested awhile  i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village  and  with great fatigue to our beasts  we managed the distance in some three hours.
Wuthering Heights,i left him there  and proceeded down the valley alone.
Wuthering Heights,the grey church looked greyer  and the lonely churchyard lonelier.
Wuthering Heights,i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.
Wuthering Heights,it was sweet  warm weather   too warm for travelling  but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below  had i seen it nearer august  i   m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes.
Wuthering Heights,in winter nothing more dreary  in summer nothing more divine  than those glens shut in by hills  and those bluff  bold swells of heath.
Wuthering Heights,i reached the grange before sunset  and knocked for admittance  but the family had retreated into the back premises  i judged  by one thin  blue wreath  curling from the kitchen chimney  and they did not hear.
Wuthering Heights,i rode into the court.
Wuthering Heights,under the porch  a girl of nine or ten sat knitting  and an old woman reclined on the housesteps  smoking a meditative pipe.
Wuthering Heights,is mrs. dean within    i demanded of the dame.
Wuthering Heights,mistress dean  nay    she answered     she doesn   t bide here  shoo   s up at th    heights.
Wuthering Heights,are you the housekeeper  then    i continued.
Wuthering Heights,eea  aw keep th    hause    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,well  i   m mr. lockwood  the master.
Wuthering Heights,are there any rooms to lodge me in  i wonder  i wish to stay all night.
Wuthering Heights,t    maister    she cried in astonishment.
Wuthering Heights,whet  whoiver knew yah wur coming  yah sud ha    send word.
Wuthering Heights,they   s nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t    place  nowt there isn   t     she threw down her pipe and bustled in  the girl followed  and i entered too  soon perceiving that her report was true  and  moreover  that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition  i bade her be composed.
Wuthering Heights,i would go out for a walk  and  meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting room for me to sup in  and a bedroom to sleep in.
Wuthering Heights,no sweeping and dusting  only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.
Wuthering Heights,she seemed willing to do her best  though she thrust the hearth brush into the grates in mistake for the poker  and malappropriated several other articles of her craft  but i retired  confiding in her energy for a resting place against my return.
Wuthering Heights,wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion.
Wuthering Heights,an after thought brought me back  when i had quitted the court.
Wuthering Heights,all well at the heights    i inquired of the woman.
Wuthering Heights,eea  f   r owt ee knaw    she answered  skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders.
Wuthering Heights,i would have asked why mrs. dean had deserted the grange  but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis  so i turned away and made my exit  rambling leisurely along  with the glow of a sinking sun behind  and the mild glory of a rising moon in front   one fading  and the other brightening   as i quitted the park  and climbed the stony by road branching off to mr. heathcliff   s dwelling.
Wuthering Heights,before i arrived in sight of it  all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west  but i could see every pebble on the path  and every blade of grass  by that splendid moon.
Wuthering Heights,i had neither to climb the gate nor to knock   it yielded to my hand.
Wuthering Heights,that is an improvement  i thought.
Wuthering Heights,and i noticed another  by the aid of my nostrils  a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees.
Wuthering Heights,both doors and lattices were open  and yet  as is usually the case in a coal district  a fine red fire illumined the chimney  the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.
Wuthering Heights,but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence  and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.
Wuthering Heights,i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered  and looked and listened in consequence  being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy  that grew as i lingered.
Wuthering Heights,con trary    said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.
Wuthering Heights,that for the third time  you dunce  i   m not going to tell you again.
Wuthering Heights,recollect  or i   ll pull your hair        contrary  then    answered another  in deep but softened tones.
Wuthering Heights,and now  kiss me  for minding so well.
Wuthering Heights,no  read it over first correctly  without a single mistake.
Wuthering Heights,the male speaker began to read  he was a young man  respectably dressed and seated at a table  having a book before him.
Wuthering Heights,his handsome features glowed with pleasure  and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder  which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek  whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention.
Wuthering Heights,its owner stood behind  her light  shining ringlets blending  at intervals  with his brown locks  as she bent to superintend his studies  and her face   it was lucky he could not see her face  or he would never have been so steady.
Wuthering Heights,i could  and i bit my lip in spite  at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty.
Wuthering Heights,the task was done  not free from further blunders  but the pupil claimed a reward  and received at least five kisses  which  however  he generously returned.
Wuthering Heights,then they came to the door  and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors.
Wuthering Heights,i supposed i should be condemned in hareton earnshaw   s heart  if not by his mouth  to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then  and feeling very mean and malignant  i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,there was unobstructed admittance on that side also  and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean  sewing and singing a song  which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance  uttered in far from musical accents.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rayther  by th    haulf  hev       em swearing i    my lugs fro   h morn to neeght  nor hearken ye hahsiver    said the tenant of the kitchen  in answer to an unheard speech of nelly   s.    it   s a blazing shame  that i cannot oppen t    blessed book  but yah set up them glories to sattan  and all t    flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th    warld  oh  ye   re a raight nowt  and shoo   s another  and that poor lad    ll be lost atween ye.
Wuthering Heights,poor lad    he added  with a groan     he   s witched  i   m sartin on   t. oh  lord  judge    em  for there   s norther law nor justice among wer rullers        no  or we should be sitting in flaming fagots  i suppose    retorted the singer.
Wuthering Heights,but wisht  old man  and read your bible like a christian  and never mind me.
Wuthering Heights,this is    fairy annie   s wedding      a bonny tune   it goes to a dance.
Wuthering Heights,mrs. dean was about to recommence  when i advanced  and recognising me directly  she jumped to her feet  crying      why  bless you  mr. lockwood  how could you think of returning in this way  all   s shut up at thrushcross grange.
Wuthering Heights,you should have given us notice        i   ve arranged to be accommodated there  for as long as i shall stay    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,i depart again to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,and how are you transplanted here  mrs. dean  tell me that.
Wuthering Heights,zillah left  and mr. heathcliff wished me to come  soon after you went to london  and stay till you returned.
Wuthering Heights,but  step in  pray  have you walked from gimmerton this evening        from the grange    i replied     and while they make me lodging room there  i want to finish my business with your master  because i don   t think of having another opportunity in a hurry.
Wuthering Heights,what business  sir    said nelly  conducting me into the house.
Wuthering Heights,he   s gone out at present  and won   t return soon.
Wuthering Heights,about the rent    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,oh  then it is with mrs. heathcliff you must settle    she observed     or rather with me.
Wuthering Heights,she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet  and i act for her  there   s nobody else.
Wuthering Heights,i looked surprised.
Wuthering Heights,ah  you have not heard of heathcliff   s death  i see    she continued.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff dead    i exclaimed  astonished.
Wuthering Heights,how long ago        three months since  but sit down  and let me take your hat  and i   ll tell you all about it.
Wuthering Heights,stop  you have had nothing to eat  have you        i want nothing  i have ordered supper at home.
Wuthering Heights,you sit down too.
Wuthering Heights,i never dreamt of his dying  let me hear how it came to pass.
Wuthering Heights,you say you don   t expect them back for some time   the young people        no   i have to scold them every evening for their late rambles  but they don   t care for me.
Wuthering Heights,at least  have a drink of our old ale  it will do you good  you seem weary.
Wuthering Heights,she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse  and i heard joseph asking whether    it warn   t a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life  and then  to get them jocks out o    t    maister   s cellar  he fair shaamed to    bide still and see it.
Wuthering Heights,she did not stay to retaliate  but re entered in a minute  bearing a reaming silver pint  whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness.
Wuthering Heights,and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of heathcliff   s history.
Wuthering Heights,he had a    queer   end  as she expressed it.
Wuthering Heights,i was summoned to wuthering heights  within a fortnight of your leaving us  she said  and i obeyed joyfully  for catherine   s sake.
Wuthering Heights,my first interview with her grieved and shocked me  she had altered so much since our separation.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here  he only told me he wanted me  and he was tired of seeing catherine  i must make the little parlour my sitting room  and keep her with me.
Wuthering Heights,it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day.
Wuthering Heights,she seemed pleased at this arrangement  and  by degrees  i smuggled over a great number of books  and other articles  that had formed her amusement at the grange  and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort.
Wuthering Heights,the delusion did not last long.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  contented at first  in a brief space grew irritable and restless.
Wuthering Heights,for one thing  she was forbidden to move out of the garden  and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on  for another  in following the house  i was forced to quit her frequently  and she complained of loneliness  she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.
Wuthering Heights,i did not mind their skirmishes  but hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also  when the master wanted to have the house to himself  and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach  or quietly joined in my occupations  and shunned remarking or addressing him   and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible   after a while  she changed her behaviour  and became incapable of letting him alone  talking at him  commenting on his stupidity and idleness  expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived   how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire  and dozing.
Wuthering Heights,he   s just like a dog  is he not  ellen    she once observed     or a cart horse  he does his work  eats his food  and sleeps eternally  what a blank  dreary mind he must have  do you ever dream  hareton  and  if you do  what is it about  but you can   t speak to me     then she looked at him  but he would neither open his mouth nor look again.
Wuthering Heights,he   s  perhaps  dreaming now    she continued.
Wuthering Heights,he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers.
Wuthering Heights,ask him  ellen.
Wuthering Heights,mr. hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs  if you don   t behave    i said.
Wuthering Heights,he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist  as if tempted to use it.
Wuthering Heights,i know why hareton never speaks  when i am in the kitchen    she exclaimed  on another occasion.
Wuthering Heights,he is afraid i shall laugh at him.
Wuthering Heights,ellen  what do you think  he began to teach himself to read once  and  because i laughed  he burned his books  and dropped it  was he not a fool        were not you naughty    i said     answer me that.
Wuthering Heights,perhaps i was    she went on     but i did not expect him to be so silly.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  if i gave you a book  would you take it now  i   ll try     she placed one she had been perusing on his hand  he flung it off  and muttered  if she did not give over  he would break her neck.
Wuthering Heights,well  i shall put it here    she said     in the table drawer  and i   m going to bed.
Wuthering Heights,then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it  and departed.
Wuthering Heights,but he would not come near it  and so i informed her in the morning  to her great disappointment.
Wuthering Heights,i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence  her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself  she had done it effectually.
Wuthering Heights,but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury  while i ironed  or pursued other such stationary employments as i could not well do in the parlour  she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.
Wuthering Heights,when hareton was there  she generally paused in an interesting part  and left the book lying about  that she did repeatedly  but he was as obstinate as a mule  and  instead of snatching at her bait  in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph  and they sat like automatons  one on each side of the fire  the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense  as he would have called it  the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.
Wuthering Heights,on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions  and catherine yawned and sighed  and teased me to talk to her  and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began  and  as a last resource  cried  and said she was tired of living  her life was useless.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  who grew more and more disinclined to society  had almost banished earnshaw from his apartment.
Wuthering Heights,owing to an accident at the commencement of march  he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,his gun burst while out on the hills by himself  a splinter cut his arm  and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.
Wuthering Heights,the consequence was that  perforce  he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity  till he made it up again.
Wuthering Heights,it suited catherine to have him there  at any rate  it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever  and she would compel me to find out business below  that she might accompany me.
Wuthering Heights,on easter monday  joseph went to gimmerton fair with some cattle  and  in the afternoon  i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw sat  morose as usual  at the chimney corner  and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes  varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs  and whispered ejaculations  and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin  who steadfastly smoked  and looked into the grate.
Wuthering Heights,at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light  she removed to the hearthstone.
Wuthering Heights,i bestowed little attention on her proceedings  but  presently  i heard her begin      i   ve found out  hareton  that i want   that i   m glad   that i should like you to be my cousin now  if you had not grown so cross to me  and so rough.
Wuthering Heights,hareton returned no answer.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  hareton  hareton  do you hear    she continued.
Wuthering Heights,get off wi    ye    he growled  with uncompromising gruffness.
Wuthering Heights,let me take that pipe    she said  cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth.
Wuthering Heights,before he could attempt to recover it  it was broken  and behind the fire.
Wuthering Heights,he swore at her and seized another.
Wuthering Heights,stop    she cried     you must listen to me first  and i can   t speak while those clouds are floating in my face.
Wuthering Heights,will you go to the devil    he exclaimed  ferociously     and let me be        no    she persisted     i won   t  i can   t tell what to do to make you talk to me  and you are determined not to understand.
Wuthering Heights,when i call you stupid  i don   t mean anything  i don   t mean that i despise you.
Wuthering Heights,come  you shall take notice of me  hareton  you are my cousin  and you shall own me.
Wuthering Heights,i shall have naught to do wi    you and your mucky pride  and your damned mocking tricks    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll go to hell  body and soul  before i look sideways after you again.
Wuthering Heights,side out o    t    gate  now  this minute     catherine frowned  and retreated to the window seat chewing her lip  and endeavouring  by humming an eccentric tune  to conceal a growing tendency to sob.
Wuthering Heights,you should be friends with your cousin  mr. hareton    i interrupted     since she repents of her sauciness.
Wuthering Heights,it would do you a great deal of good  it would make you another man to have her for a companion.
Wuthering Heights,a companion    he cried     when she hates me  and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon  nay  if it made me a king  i   d not be scorned for seeking her good will any more.
Wuthering Heights,it is not i who hate you  it is you who hate me    wept cathy  no longer disguising her trouble.
Wuthering Heights,you hate me as much as mr. heathcliff does  and more.
Wuthering Heights,you   re a damned liar    began earnshaw     why have i made him angry  by taking your part  then  a hundred times  and that when you sneered at and despised me  and   go on plaguing me  and i   ll step in yonder  and say you worried me out of the kitchen        i didn   t know you took my part    she answered  drying her eyes     and i was miserable and bitter at everybody  but now i thank you  and beg you to forgive me  what can i do besides     she returned to the hearth  and frankly extended her hand.
Wuthering Heights,he blackened and scowled like a thunder cloud  and kept his fists resolutely clenched  and his gaze fixed on the ground.
Wuthering Heights,catherine  by instinct  must have divined it was obdurate perversity  and not dislike  that prompted this dogged conduct  for  after remaining an instant undecided  she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.
Wuthering Heights,the little rogue thought i had not seen her  and  drawing back  she took her former station by the window  quite demurely.
Wuthering Heights,i shook my head reprovingly  and then she blushed and whispered      well  what should i have done  ellen  he wouldn   t shake hands  and he wouldn   t look  i must show him some way that i like him   that i want to be friends.
Wuthering Heights,whether the kiss convinced hareton  i cannot tell  he was very careful  for some minutes  that his face should not be seen  and when he did raise it  he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.
Wuthering Heights,catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper  and having tied it with a bit of ribbon  and addressed it to    mr. hareton earnshaw    she desired me to be her ambassadress  and convey the present to its destined recipient.
Wuthering Heights,and tell him  if he   ll take it  i   ll come and teach him to read it right    she said     and  if he refuse it  i   ll go upstairs  and never tease him again.
Wuthering Heights,i carried it  and repeated the message  anxiously watched by my employer.
Wuthering Heights,hareton would not open his fingers  so i laid it on his knee.
Wuthering Heights,he did not strike it off  either.
Wuthering Heights,i returned to my work.
Wuthering Heights,catherine leaned her head and arms on the table  till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed  then she stole away  and quietly seated herself beside her cousin.
Wuthering Heights,he trembled  and his face glowed  all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him  he could not summon courage  at first  to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look  and her murmured petition.
Wuthering Heights,say you forgive me  hareton  do.
Wuthering Heights,you can make me so happy by speaking that little word.
Wuthering Heights,he muttered something inaudible.
Wuthering Heights,and you   ll be my friend    added catherine  interrogatively.
Wuthering Heights,nay  you   ll be ashamed of me every day of your life    he answered     and the more ashamed  the more you know me  and i cannot bide it.
Wuthering Heights,so you won   t be my friend    she said  smiling as sweet as honey  and creeping close up.
Wuthering Heights,i overheard no further distinguishable talk  but  on looking round again  i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book  that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides  and the enemies were  thenceforth  sworn allies.
Wuthering Heights,the work they studied was full of costly pictures  and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home.
Wuthering Heights,he  poor man  was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine seated on the same bench with hareton earnshaw  leaning her hand on his shoulder  and confounded at his favourite   s endurance of her proximity  it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.
Wuthering Heights,his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew  as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table  and overlaid it with dirty bank notes from his pocket book  the produce of the day   s transactions.
Wuthering Heights,at length he summoned hareton from his seat.
Wuthering Heights,tak    these in to t    maister  lad    he said     and bide there.
Wuthering Heights,i   s gang up to my own rahm.
Wuthering Heights,this hoile   s neither mensful nor seemly for us  we mun side out and seearch another.
Wuthering Heights,come  catherine    i said     we must    side out    too  i   ve done my ironing.
Wuthering Heights,are you ready to go        it is not eight o   clock    she answered  rising unwillingly.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  i   ll leave this book upon the chimney piece  and i   ll bring some more to morrow.
Wuthering Heights,ony books that yah leave  i shall tak    into th    hahse    said joseph     and it   ll be mitch if yah find    em agean  soa  yah may plase yerseln     cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers  and  smiling as she passed hareton  went singing upstairs  lighter of heart  i venture to say  than ever she had been under that roof before  except  perhaps  during her earliest visits to linton.
Wuthering Heights,the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly  though it encountered temporary interruptions.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish  and my young lady was no philosopher  and no paragon of patience  but both their minds tending to the same point   one loving and desiring to esteem  and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed   they contrived in the end to reach it.
Wuthering Heights,you see  mr. lockwood  it was easy enough to win mrs. heathcliff   s heart.
Wuthering Heights,but now  i   m glad you did not try.
Wuthering Heights,the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two.
Wuthering Heights,i shall envy no one on their wedding day  there won   t be a happier woman than myself in england   on the morrow of that monday  earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments  and therefore remaining about the house  i speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me  as heretofore.
Wuthering Heights,she got downstairs before me  and out into the garden  where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work  and when i went to bid them come to breakfast  i saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes  and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the grange.
Wuthering Heights,i was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half hour  the black currant trees were the apple of joseph   s eye  and she had just fixed her choice of a flower bed in the midst of them.
Wuthering Heights,there  that will be all shown to the master    i exclaimed     the minute it is discovered.
Wuthering Heights,and what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden  we shall have a fine explosion on the head of it  see if we don   t  mr. hareton  i wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding        i   d forgotten they were joseph   s    answered earnshaw  rather puzzled     but i   ll tell him i did it.
Wuthering Heights,we always ate our meals with mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,i held the mistress   s post in making tea and carving  so i was indispensable at table.
Wuthering Heights,catherine usually sat by me  but to day she stole nearer to hareton  and i presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility.
Wuthering Heights,now  mind you don   t talk with and notice your cousin too much    were my whispered instructions as we entered the room.
Wuthering Heights,it will certainly annoy mr. heathcliff  and he   ll be mad at you both.
Wuthering Heights,i   m not going to    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,the minute after  she had sidled to him  and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge.
Wuthering Heights,he dared not speak to her there  he dared hardly look  and yet she went on teasing  till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.
Wuthering Heights,i frowned  and then she glanced towards the master  whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company  as his countenance evinced  and she grew serious for an instant  scrutinizing him with deep gravity.
Wuthering Heights,afterwards she turned  and recommenced her nonsense  at last  hareton uttered a smothered laugh.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff started  his eye rapidly surveyed our faces.
Wuthering Heights,catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance  which he abhorred.
Wuthering Heights,it is well you are out of my reach    he exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,what fiend possesses you to stare back at me  continually  with those infernal eyes  down with them  and don   t remind me of your existence again.
Wuthering Heights,i thought i had cured you of laughing.
Wuthering Heights,it was me    muttered hareton.
Wuthering Heights,what do you say    demanded the master.
Wuthering Heights,hareton looked at his plate  and did not repeat the confession.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff looked at him a bit  and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing.
Wuthering Heights,we had nearly finished  and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder  so i anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting  when joseph appeared at the door  revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected.
Wuthering Heights,he must have seen cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it  for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud  and rendered his speech difficult to understand  he began         i mun hev    my wage  and i mun goa  i hed aimed to dee wheare i   d sarved fur sixty year  and i thowt i   d lug my books up into t    garret  and all my bits o    stuff  and they sud hev    t    kitchen to theirseln  for t    sake o    quietness.
Wuthering Heights,it wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun  but i thowt i could do that  but nah  shoo   s taan my garden fro    me  and by th    heart  maister  i cannot stand it  yah may bend to th    yoak an ye will   i noan used to    t  and an old man doesn   t sooin get used to new barthens.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rayther arn my bite an    my sup wi    a hammer in th    road        now  now  idiot    interrupted heathcliff     cut it short  what   s your grievance  i   ll interfere in no quarrels between you and nelly.
Wuthering Heights,she may thrust you into the coal hole for anything i care.
Wuthering Heights,it   s noan nelly    answered joseph.
Wuthering Heights,i sudn   t shift for nelly   nasty ill nowt as shoo is.
Wuthering Heights,thank god  shoo cannot stale t    sowl o    nob   dy  shoo wer niver soa handsome  but what a body mud look at her    bout winking.
Wuthering Heights,it   s yon flaysome  graceless quean  that   s witched our lad  wi    her bold een and her forrard ways   till   nay  it fair brusts my heart  he   s forgotten all i   ve done for him  and made on him  and goan and riven up a whole row o    t    grandest currant trees i    t    garden    and here he lamented outright  unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries  and earnshaw   s ingratitude and dangerous condition.
Wuthering Heights,is the fool drunk    asked mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  is it you he   s finding fault with        i   ve pulled up two or three bushes    replied the young man     but i   m going to set    em again.
Wuthering Heights,and why have you pulled them up    said the master.
Wuthering Heights,catherine wisely put in her tongue.
Wuthering Heights,we wanted to plant some flowers there    she cried.
Wuthering Heights,i   m the only person to blame  for i wished him to do it.
Wuthering Heights,and who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place    demanded her father in law  much surprised.
Wuthering Heights,and who ordered you to obey her    he added  turning to hareton.
Wuthering Heights,the latter was speechless  his cousin replied      you shouldn   t grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament  when you have taken all my land        your land  insolent slut  you never had any    said heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,and my money    she continued  returning his angry glare  and meantime biting a piece of crust  the remnant of her breakfast.
Wuthering Heights,silence    he exclaimed.
Wuthering Heights,get done  and begone        and hareton   s land  and his money    pursued the reckless thing.
Wuthering Heights,hareton and i are friends now  and i shall tell him all about you     the master seemed confounded a moment  he grew pale  and rose up  eyeing her all the while  with an expression of mortal hate.
Wuthering Heights,if you strike me  hareton will strike you    she said     so you may as well sit down.
Wuthering Heights,if hareton does not turn you out of the room  i   ll strike him to hell    thundered heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,damnable witch  dare you pretend to rouse him against me  off with her  do you hear  fling her into the kitchen  i   ll kill her  ellen dean  if you let her come into my sight again     hareton tried  under his breath  to persuade her to go.
Wuthering Heights,drag her away    he cried  savagely.
Wuthering Heights,are you staying to talk    and he approached to execute his own command.
Wuthering Heights,he   ll not obey you  wicked man  any more    said catherine     and he   ll soon detest you as much as i do.
Wuthering Heights,wisht  wisht    muttered the young man  reproachfully     i will not hear you speak so to him.
Wuthering Heights,have done.
Wuthering Heights,but you won   t let him strike me    she cried.
Wuthering Heights,come  then    he whispered earnestly.
Wuthering Heights,it was too late  heathcliff had caught hold of her.
Wuthering Heights,now  you go    he said to earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,accursed witch  this time she has provoked me when i could not bear it  and i   ll make her repent it for ever     he had his hand in her hair  hareton attempted to release her locks  entreating him not to hurt her that once.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff   s black eyes flashed  he seemed ready to tear catherine in pieces  and i was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue  when of a sudden his fingers relaxed  he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm  and gazed intently in her face.
Wuthering Heights,then he drew his hand over his eyes  stood a moment to collect himself apparently  and turning anew to catherine  said  with assumed calmness      you must learn to avoid putting me in a passion  or i shall really murder you some time  go with mrs. dean  and keep with her  and confine your insolence to her ears.
Wuthering Heights,as to hareton earnshaw  if i see him listen to you  i   ll send him seeking his bread where he can get it  your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  take her  and leave me  all of you  leave me     i led my young lady out  she was too glad of her escape to resist  the other followed  and mr. heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.
Wuthering Heights,i had counselled catherine to dine upstairs  but  as soon as he perceived her vacant seat  he sent me to call her.
Wuthering Heights,he spoke to none of us  ate very little  and went out directly afterwards  intimating that he should not return before evening.
Wuthering Heights,the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence  where i heard hareton sternly check his cousin  on her offering a revelation of her father in law   s conduct to his father.
Wuthering Heights,he said he wouldn   t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement  if he were the devil  it didn   t signify  he would stand by him  and he   d rather she would abuse himself  as she used to  than begin on mr. heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,catherine was waxing cross at this  but he found means to make her hold her tongue  by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father  then she comprehended that earnshaw took the master   s reputation home to himself  and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break   chains  forged by habit  which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen.
Wuthering Heights,she showed a good heart  thenceforth  in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning heathcliff  and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton  indeed  i don   t believe she has ever breathed a syllable  in the latter   s hearing  against her oppressor since.
Wuthering Heights,when this slight disagreement was over  they were friends again  and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.
Wuthering Heights,i came in to sit with them  after i had done my work  and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them  that i did not notice how time got on.
Wuthering Heights,you know  they both appeared in a measure my children  i had long been proud of one  and now  i was sure  the other would be a source of equal satisfaction.
Wuthering Heights,his honest  warm  and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred  and catherine   s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.
Wuthering Heights,his brightening mind brightened his features  and added spirit and nobility to their aspect  i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights  after her expedition to the crags.
Wuthering Heights,while i admired and they laboured  dusk drew on  and with it returned the master.
Wuthering Heights,he came upon us quite unexpectedly  entering by the front way  and had a full view of the whole three  ere we could raise our heads to glance at him.
Wuthering Heights,well  i reflected  there was never a pleasanter  or more harmless sight  and it will be a burning shame to scold them.
Wuthering Heights,the red fire light glowed on their two bonny heads  and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children  for  though he was twenty three and she eighteen  each had so much of novelty to feel and learn  that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.
Wuthering Heights,they lifted their eyes together  to encounter mr. heathcliff  perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar  and they are those of catherine earnshaw.
Wuthering Heights,the present catherine has no other likeness to her  except a breadth of forehead  and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty  whether she will or not.
Wuthering Heights,with hareton the resemblance is carried farther  it is singular at all times  then it was particularly striking  because his senses were alert  and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.
Wuthering Heights,i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr. heathcliff  he walked to the hearth in evident agitation  but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man  or  i should say  altered its character  for it was there yet.
Wuthering Heights,he took the book from his hand  and glanced at the open page  then returned it without any observation  merely signing catherine away  her companion lingered very little behind her  and i was about to depart also  but he bid me sit still.
Wuthering Heights,it is a poor conclusion  is it not    he observed  having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed     an absurd termination to my violent exertions  i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses  and train myself to be capable of working like hercules  and when everything is ready and in my power  i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished  my old enemies have not beaten me  now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives  i could do it  and none could hinder me.
Wuthering Heights,but where is the use  i don   t care for striking  i can   t take the trouble to raise my hand  that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity.
Wuthering Heights,it is far from being the case  i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction  and i am too idle to destroy for nothing.
Wuthering Heights,nelly  there is a strange change approaching  i   m in its shadow at present.
Wuthering Heights,i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink.
Wuthering Heights,those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me  and that appearance causes me pain  amounting to agony.
Wuthering Heights,about her i won   t speak  and i don   t desire to think  but i earnestly wish she were invisible  her presence invokes only maddening sensations.
Wuthering Heights,he moves me differently  and yet if i could do it without seeming insane  i   d never see him again  you   ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so    he added  making an effort to smile     if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.
Wuthering Heights,but you   ll not talk of what i tell you  and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself  it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.
Wuthering Heights,five minutes ago hareton seemed a personification of my youth  not a human being  i felt to him in such a variety of ways  that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally.
Wuthering Heights,in the first place  his startling likeness to catherine connected him fearfully with her.
Wuthering Heights,that  however  which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination  is actually the least  for what is not connected with her to me  and what does not recall her  i cannot look down to this floor  but her features are shaped in the flags  in every cloud  in every tree   filling the air at night  and caught by glimpses in every object by day   i am surrounded with her image  the most ordinary faces of men and women   my own features   mock me with a resemblance.
Wuthering Heights,the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist  and that i have lost her  well  hareton   s aspect was the ghost of my immortal love  of my wild endeavours to hold my right  my degradation  my pride  my happiness  and my anguish        but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you  only it will let you know why  with a reluctance to be always alone  his society is no benefit  rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer  and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together.
Wuthering Heights,i can give them no attention any more.
Wuthering Heights,but what do you mean by a change  mr. heathcliff    i said  alarmed at his manner  though he was neither in danger of losing his senses  nor dying  according to my judgment  he was quite strong and healthy  and  as to his reason  from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things  and entertaining odd fancies.
Wuthering Heights,he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol  but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine.
Wuthering Heights,i shall not know that till it comes    he said     i   m only half conscious of it now.
Wuthering Heights,you have no feeling of illness  have you    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,no  nelly  i have not    he answered.
Wuthering Heights,then you are not afraid of death    i pursued.
Wuthering Heights,afraid  no    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,i have neither a fear  nor a presentiment  nor a hope of death.
Wuthering Heights,why should i  with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living  and unperilous occupations  i ought to  and probably shall  remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head.
Wuthering Heights,and yet i cannot continue in this condition  i have to remind myself to breathe   almost to remind my heart to beat  and it is like bending back a stiff spring  it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought  and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead  which is not associated with one universal idea.
Wuthering Heights,i have a single wish  and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it.
Wuthering Heights,they have yearned towards it so long  and so unwaveringly  that i   m convinced it will be reached   and soon   because it has devoured my existence  i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment.
Wuthering Heights,my confessions have not relieved me  but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show.
Wuthering Heights,o god  it is a long fight  i wish it were over     he began to pace the room  muttering terrible things to himself  till i was inclined to believe  as he said joseph did  that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell.
Wuthering Heights,i wondered greatly how it would end.
Wuthering Heights,though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind  even by looks  it was his habitual mood  i had no doubt  he asserted it himself  but not a soul  from his general bearing  would have conjectured the fact.
Wuthering Heights,you did not when you saw him  mr. lockwood  and at the period of which i speak  he was just the same as then  only fonder of continued solitude  and perhaps still more laconic in company.
Wuthering Heights,for some days after that evening  mr. heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals  yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton and cathy.
Wuthering Heights,he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings  choosing rather to absent himself  and eating once in twenty four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him.
Wuthering Heights,one night  after the family were in bed  i heard him go downstairs  and out at the front door.
Wuthering Heights,i did not hear him re enter  and in the morning i found he was still away.
Wuthering Heights,we were in april then  the weather was sweet and warm  the grass as green as showers and sun could make it  and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom.
Wuthering Heights,after breakfast  catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house  and she beguiled hareton  who had perfectly recovered from his accident  to dig and arrange her little garden  which was shifted to that corner by the influence of joseph   s complaints.
Wuthering Heights,i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around  and the beautiful soft blue overhead  when my young lady  who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border  returned only half laden  and informed us that mr. heathcliff was coming in.
Wuthering Heights,and he spoke to me    she added  with a perplexed countenance.
Wuthering Heights,what did he say    asked hareton.
Wuthering Heights,he told me to begone as fast as i could    she answered.
Wuthering Heights,but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him.
Wuthering Heights,how    he inquired.
Wuthering Heights,why  almost bright and cheerful.
Wuthering Heights,no  almost nothing   very much excited  and wild  and glad    she replied.
Wuthering Heights,night walking amuses him  then    i remarked  affecting a careless manner  in reality as surprised as she was  and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement  for to see the master looking glad would not be an every day spectacle.
Wuthering Heights,i framed an excuse to go in.
Wuthering Heights,heathcliff stood at the open door  he was pale  and he trembled  yet  certainly  he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes  that altered the aspect of his whole face.
Wuthering Heights,will you have some breakfast    i said.
Wuthering Heights,you must be hungry  rambling about all night    i wanted to discover where he had been  but i did not like to ask directly.
Wuthering Heights,no  i   m not hungry    he answered  averting his head  and speaking rather contemptuously  as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.
Wuthering Heights,i felt perplexed  i didn   t know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.
Wuthering Heights,i don   t think it right to wander out of doors    i observed     instead of being in bed  it is not wise  at any rate this moist season.
Wuthering Heights,i daresay you   ll catch a bad cold  or a fever  you have something the matter with you now        nothing but what i can bear    he replied     and with the greatest pleasure  provided you   ll leave me alone  get in  and don   t annoy me.
Wuthering Heights,i obeyed  and  in passing  i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.
Wuthering Heights,yes    i reflected to myself     we shall have a fit of illness.
Wuthering Heights,i cannot conceive what he has been doing.
Wuthering Heights,that noon he sat down to dinner with us  and received a heaped up plate from my hands  as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.
Wuthering Heights,i   ve neither cold nor fever  nelly    he remarked  in allusion to my morning   s speech     and i   m ready to do justice to the food you give me.
Wuthering Heights,he took his knife and fork  and was going to commence eating  when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.
Wuthering Heights,he laid them on the table  looked eagerly towards the window  then rose and went out.
Wuthering Heights,we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal  and earnshaw said he   d go and ask why he would not dine  he thought we had grieved him some way.
Wuthering Heights,well  is he coming    cried catherine  when her cousin returned.
Wuthering Heights,nay    he answered     but he   s not angry  he seemed rarely pleased indeed  only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice  and then he bid me be off to you  he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else.
Wuthering Heights,i set his plate to keep warm on the fender  and after an hour or two he re entered  when the room was clear  in no degree calmer  the same unnatural   it was unnatural   appearance of joy under his black brows  the same bloodless hue  and his teeth visible  now and then  in a kind of smile  his frame shivering  not as one shivers with chill or weakness  but as a tight stretched cord vibrates   a strong thrilling  rather than trembling.
Wuthering Heights,i will ask what is the matter  i thought  or who should  and i exclaimed      have you heard any good news  mr. heathcliff  you look uncommonly animated.
Wuthering Heights,where should good news come from to me    he said.
Wuthering Heights,i   m animated with hunger  and  seemingly  i must not eat.
Wuthering Heights,your dinner is here    i returned     why won   t you get it        i don   t want it now    he muttered  hastily     i   ll wait till supper.
Wuthering Heights,and  nelly  once for all  let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away from me.
Wuthering Heights,i wish to be troubled by nobody  i wish to have this place to myself.
Wuthering Heights,is there some new reason for this banishment    i inquired.
Wuthering Heights,tell me why you are so queer  mr. heathcliff  where were you last night  i   m not putting the question through idle curiosity  but          you are putting the question through very idle curiosity    he interrupted  with a laugh.
Wuthering Heights,yet i   ll answer it.
Wuthering Heights,last night i was on the threshold of hell.
Wuthering Heights,to day  i am within sight of my heaven.
Wuthering Heights,i have my eyes on it  hardly three feet to sever me  and now you   d better go  you   ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you  if you refrain from prying.
Wuthering Heights,having swept the hearth and wiped the table  i departed  more perplexed than ever.
Wuthering Heights,he did not quit the house again that afternoon  and no one intruded on his solitude  till  at eight o   clock  i deemed it proper  though unsummoned  to carry a candle and his supper to him.
Wuthering Heights,he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice  but not looking out  his face was turned to the interior gloom.
Wuthering Heights,the fire had smouldered to ashes  the room was filled with the damp  mild air of the cloudy evening  and so still  that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguishable  but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles  or through the large stones which it could not cover.
Wuthering Heights,i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate  and commenced shutting the casements  one after another  till i came to his.
Wuthering Heights,must i close this    i asked  in order to rouse him  for he would not stir.
Wuthering Heights,the light flashed on his features as i spoke.
Wuthering Heights,oh  mr. lockwood  i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view  those deep black eyes  that smile  and ghastly paleness  it appeared to me  not mr. heathcliff  but a goblin  and  in my terror  i let the candle bend towards the wall  and it left me in darkness.
Wuthering Heights,yes  close it    he replied  in his familiar voice.
Wuthering Heights,there  that is pure awkwardness  why did you hold the candle horizontally  be quick  and bring another.
Wuthering Heights,i hurried out in a foolish state of dread  and said to joseph      the master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.
Wuthering Heights,for i dared not go in myself again just then.
Wuthering Heights,joseph rattled some fire into the shovel  and went  but he brought it back immediately  with the supper tray in his other hand  explaining that mr. heathcliff was going to bed  and he wanted nothing to eat till morning.
Wuthering Heights,we heard him mount the stairs directly  he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber  but turned into that with the panelled bed  its window  as i mentioned before  is wide enough for anybody to get through  and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion  of which he had rather we had no suspicion.
Wuthering Heights,is he a ghoul or a vampire    i mused.
Wuthering Heights,i had read of such hideous incarnate demons.
Wuthering Heights,and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy  and watched him grow to youth  and followed him almost through his whole course  and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror.
Wuthering Heights,but where did he come from  the little dark thing  harboured by a good man to his bane    muttered superstition  as i dozed into unconsciousness.
Wuthering Heights,and i began  half dreaming  to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him  and  repeating my waking meditations  i tracked his existence over again  with grim variations  at last  picturing his death and funeral  of which  all i can remember is  being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument  and consulting the sexton about it  and  as he had no surname  and we could not tell his age  we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word     heathcliff.
Wuthering Heights,that came true  we were.
Wuthering Heights,if you enter the kirkyard  you   ll read  on his headstone  only that  and the date of his death.
Wuthering Heights,dawn restored me to common sense.
Wuthering Heights,i rose  and went into the garden  as soon as i could see  to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window.
Wuthering Heights,there were none.
Wuthering Heights,he has stayed at home    i thought     and he   ll be all right to day.
Wuthering Heights,i prepared breakfast for the household  as was my usual custom  but told hareton and catherine to get theirs ere the master came down  for he lay late.
Wuthering Heights,they preferred taking it out of doors  under the trees  and i set a little table to accommodate them.
Wuthering Heights,on my re entrance  i found mr. heathcliff below.
Wuthering Heights,he and joseph were conversing about some farming business  he gave clear  minute directions concerning the matter discussed  but he spoke rapidly  and turned his head continually aside  and had the same excited expression  even more exaggerated.
Wuthering Heights,when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose  and i put a basin of coffee before him.
Wuthering Heights,he drew it nearer  and then rested his arms on the table  and looked at the opposite wall  as i supposed  surveying one particular portion  up and down  with glittering  restless eyes  and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.
Wuthering Heights,come now    i exclaimed  pushing some bread against his hand     eat and drink that  while it is hot  it has been waiting near an hour.
Wuthering Heights,he didn   t notice me  and yet he smiled.
Wuthering Heights,i   d rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff  master    i cried     don   t  for god   s sake  stare as if you saw an unearthly vision.
Wuthering Heights,don   t  for god   s sake  shout so loud    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,turn round  and tell me  are we by ourselves        of course    was my answer     of course we are.
Wuthering Heights,still  i involuntarily obeyed him  as if i was not quite sure.
Wuthering Heights,with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things  and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.
Wuthering Heights,now  i perceived he was not looking at the wall  for when i regarded him alone  it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards    distance.
Wuthering Heights,and whatever it was  it communicated  apparently  both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes  at least the anguished  yet raptured  expression of his countenance suggested that idea.
Wuthering Heights,the fancied object was not fixed  either  his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence  and  even in speaking to me  were never weaned away.
Wuthering Heights,i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food  if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties  if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread  his fingers clenched before they reached it  and remained on the table  forgetful of their aim.
Wuthering Heights,i sat  a model of patience  trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation  till he grew irritable  and got up  asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals  and saying that on the next occasion i needn   t wait  i might set the things down and go.
Wuthering Heights,having uttered these words he left the house  slowly sauntered down the garden path  and disappeared through the gate.
Wuthering Heights,the hours crept anxiously by  another evening came.
Wuthering Heights,i did not retire to rest till late  and when i did  i could not sleep.
Wuthering Heights,he returned after midnight  and  instead of going to bed  shut himself into the room beneath.
Wuthering Heights,i listened  and tossed about  and  finally  dressed and descended.
Wuthering Heights,it was too irksome to lie there  harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.
Wuthering Heights,i distinguished mr. heathcliff   s step  restlessly measuring the floor  and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration  resembling a groan.
Wuthering Heights,he muttered detached words also  the only one i could catch was the name of catherine  coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering  and spoken as one would speak to a person present  low and earnest  and wrung from the depth of his soul.
Wuthering Heights,i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment  but i desired to divert him from his reverie  and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire  stirred it  and began to scrape the cinders.
Wuthering Heights,it drew him forth sooner than i expected.
Wuthering Heights,he opened the door immediately  and said      nelly  come here   is it morning  come in with your light.
Wuthering Heights,it is striking four    i answered.
Wuthering Heights,you want a candle to take upstairs  you might have lit one at this fire.
Wuthering Heights,no  i don   t wish to go upstairs    he said.
Wuthering Heights,come in  and kindle me a fire  and do anything there is to do about the room.
Wuthering Heights,i must blow the coals red first  before i can carry any    i replied  getting a chair and the bellows.
Wuthering Heights,he roamed to and fro  meantime  in a state approaching distraction  his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between.
Wuthering Heights,when day breaks i   ll send for green    he said     i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters  and while i can act calmly.
Wuthering Heights,i have not written my will yet  and how to leave my property i cannot determine.
Wuthering Heights,i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth.
Wuthering Heights,i would not talk so  mr. heathcliff    i interposed.
Wuthering Heights,let your will be a while  you   ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet  i never expected that your nerves would be disordered  they are  at present  marvellously so  however  and almost entirely through your own fault.
Wuthering Heights,the way you   ve passed these three last days might knock up a titan.
Wuthering Heights,do take some food  and some repose.
Wuthering Heights,you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both.
Wuthering Heights,your cheeks are hollow  and your eyes blood shot  like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.
Wuthering Heights,it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest    he replied.
Wuthering Heights,i assure you it is through no settled designs.
Wuthering Heights,i   ll do both  as soon as i possibly can.
Wuthering Heights,but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms    length of the shore  i must reach it first  and then i   ll rest.
Wuthering Heights,well  never mind mr. green  as to repenting of my injustices  i   ve done no injustice  and i repent of nothing.
Wuthering Heights,i   m too happy  and yet i   m not happy enough.
Wuthering Heights,my soul   s bliss kills my body  but does not satisfy itself.
Wuthering Heights,happy  master    i cried.
Wuthering Heights,strange happiness  if you would hear me without being angry  i might offer some advice that would make you happier.
Wuthering Heights,what is that    he asked.
Wuthering Heights,give it.
Wuthering Heights,you are aware  mr. heathcliff    i said     that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish  unchristian life  and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period.
Wuthering Heights,you must have forgotten the contents of the book  and you may not have space to search it now.
Wuthering Heights,could it be hurtful to send for some one   some minister of any denomination  it does not matter which   to explain it  and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts  and how unfit you will be for its heaven  unless a change takes place before you die        i   m rather obliged than angry  nelly    he said     for you remind me of the manner in which i desire to be buried.
Wuthering Heights,it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening.
Wuthering Heights,you and hareton may  if you please  accompany me  and mind  particularly  to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins  no minister need come  nor need anything be said over me.
Wuthering Heights,i tell you i have nearly attained my heaven  and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.
Wuthering Heights,and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast  and died by that means  and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk    i said  shocked at his godless indifference.
Wuthering Heights,how would you like it        they won   t do that    he replied     if they did  you must have me removed secretly  and if you neglect it you shall prove  practically  that the dead are not annihilated     as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den  and i breathed freer.
Wuthering Heights,but in the afternoon  while joseph and hareton were at their work  he came into the kitchen again  and  with a wild look  bid me come and sit in the house  he wanted somebody with him.
Wuthering Heights,i declined  telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me  and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone.
Wuthering Heights,i believe you think me a fiend    he said  with his dismal laugh     something too horrible to live under a decent roof.
Wuthering Heights,then turning to catherine  who was there  and who drew behind me at his approach  he added  half sneeringly       will you come  chuck  i   ll not hurt you.
Wuthering Heights,no  to you i   ve made myself worse than the devil.
Wuthering Heights,well  there is one who won   t shrink from my company  by god  she   s relentless.
Wuthering Heights,oh  damn it  it   s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear   even mine.
Wuthering Heights,he solicited the society of no one more.
Wuthering Heights,at dusk he went into his chamber.
Wuthering Heights,through the whole night  and far into the morning  we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself.
Wuthering Heights,hareton was anxious to enter  but i bid him fetch mr. kenneth  and he should go in and see him.
Wuthering Heights,when he came  and i requested admittance and tried to open the door  i found it locked  and heathcliff bid us be damned.
Wuthering Heights,he was better  and would be left alone  so the doctor went away.
Wuthering Heights,the following evening was very wet  indeed  it poured down till day dawn  and  as i took my morning walk round the house  i observed the master   s window swinging open  and the rain driving straight in.
Wuthering Heights,he cannot be in bed  i thought  those showers would drench him through.
Wuthering Heights,he must either be up or out.
Wuthering Heights,but i   ll make no more ado  i   ll go boldly and look.
Wuthering Heights,having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key  i ran to unclose the panels  for the chamber was vacant  quickly pushing them aside  i peeped in.
Wuthering Heights,mr. heathcliff was there   laid on his back.
Wuthering Heights,his eyes met mine so keen and fierce  i started  and then he seemed to smile.
Wuthering Heights,i could not think him dead  but his face and throat were washed with rain  the bed clothes dripped  and he was perfectly still.
Wuthering Heights,the lattice  flapping to and fro  had grazed one hand that rested on the sill  no blood trickled from the broken skin  and when i put my fingers to it  i could doubt no more  he was dead and stark   i hasped the window  i combed his black long hair from his forehead  i tried to close his eyes  to extinguish  if possible  that frightful  life like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it.
Wuthering Heights,they would not shut  they seemed to sneer at my attempts  and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too  taken with another fit of cowardice  i cried out for joseph.
Wuthering Heights,joseph shuffled up and made a noise  but resolutely refused to meddle with him.
Wuthering Heights,th    divil   s harried off his soul    he cried     and he may hev    his carcass into t    bargin  for aught i care  ech  what a wicked    un he looks  girning at death    and the old sinner grinned in mockery.
Wuthering Heights,i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed  but suddenly composing himself  he fell on his knees  and raised his hands  and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights.
Wuthering Heights,i felt stunned by the awful event  and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.
Wuthering Heights,but poor hareton  the most wronged  was the only one who really suffered much.
Wuthering Heights,he sat by the corpse all night  weeping in bitter earnest.
Wuthering Heights,he pressed its hand  and kissed the sarcastic  savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating  and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart  though it be tough as tempered steel.
Wuthering Heights,mr. kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.
Wuthering Heights,i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days  fearing it might lead to trouble  and then  i am persuaded  he did not abstain on purpose  it was the consequence of his strange illness  not the cause.
Wuthering Heights,we buried him  to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood  as he wished.
Wuthering Heights,earnshaw and i  the sexton  and six men to carry the coffin  comprehended the whole attendance.
Wuthering Heights,the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave  we stayed to see it covered.
Wuthering Heights,hareton  with a streaming face  dug green sods  and laid them over the brown mould himself  at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds   and i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly.
Wuthering Heights,but the country folks  if you ask them  would swear on the bible that he walks  there are those who speak to having met him near the church  and on the moor  and even within this house.
Wuthering Heights,idle tales  you   ll say  and so say i.
Wuthering Heights,yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on    em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death    and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago.
Wuthering Heights,i was going to the grange one evening   a dark evening  threatening thunder   and  just at the turn of the heights  i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him  he was crying terribly  and i supposed the lambs were skittish  and would not be guided.
Wuthering Heights,what is the matter  my little man    i asked.
Wuthering Heights,there   s heathcliff and a woman yonder  under t    nab    he blubbered     un    i darnut pass    em.
Wuthering Heights,i saw nothing  but neither the sheep nor he would go on  so i bid him take the road lower down.
Wuthering Heights,he probably raised the phantoms from thinking  as he traversed the moors alone  on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat.
Wuthering Heights,yet  still  i don   t like being out in the dark now  and i don   t like being left by myself in this grim house  i cannot help it  i shall be glad when they leave it  and shift to the grange.
Wuthering Heights,they are going to the grange  then    i said.
Wuthering Heights,yes    answered mrs. dean     as soon as they are married  and that will be on new year   s day.
Wuthering Heights,and who will live here then        why  joseph will take care of the house  and  perhaps  a lad to keep him company.
Wuthering Heights,they will live in the kitchen  and the rest will be shut up.
Wuthering Heights,for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it    i observed.
Wuthering Heights,no  mr. lockwood    said nelly  shaking her head.
Wuthering Heights,i believe the dead are at peace  but it is not right to speak of them with levity.
Wuthering Heights,at that moment the garden gate swung to  the ramblers were returning.
Wuthering Heights,they are afraid of nothing    i grumbled  watching their approach through the window.
Wuthering Heights,together  they would brave satan and all his legions.
Wuthering Heights,as they stepped on to the door stones  and halted to take a last look at the moon   or  more correctly  at each other by her light   i felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again  and  pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs. dean  and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness  i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house door  and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his fellow servant   s gay indiscretions  had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.
Wuthering Heights,my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.
Wuthering Heights,when beneath its walls  i perceived decay had made progress  even in seven months  many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass  and slates jutted off  here and there  beyond the right line of the roof  to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.
Wuthering Heights,i sought  and soon discovered  the three headstones on the slope next the moor  the middle one grey  and half buried in heath  edgar linton   s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot  heathcliff   s still bare.
Wuthering Heights,i lingered round them  under that benign sky  watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells  listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass  and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
Carmilla, upon a paper attached to the narrative which follows  doctor hesselius has written a rather elaborate note  which he accompanies with a reference to his essay on the strange subject which the ms. illuminates.
Carmilla,this mysterious subject he treats  in that essay  with his usual learning and acumen  and with remarkable directness and condensation.
Carmilla,it will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man   s collected papers.
Carmilla,as i publish the case  in this volume  simply to interest the    laity    i shall forestall the intelligent lady  who relates it  in nothing  and after due consideration  i have determined  therefore  to abstain from presenting any pr  cis of the learned doctor   s reasoning  or extract from his statement on a subject which he describes as    involving  not improbably  some of the profoundest arcana of our dual existence  and its intermediates.
Carmilla,i was anxious on discovering this paper  to reopen the correspondence commenced by doctor hesselius  so many years before  with a person so clever and careful as his informant seems to have been.
Carmilla,much to my regret  however  i found that she had died in the interval.
Carmilla,she  probably  could have added little to the narrative which she communicates in the following pages  with  so far as i can pronounce  such conscientious particularity.
Carmilla,in styria  we  though by no means magnificent people  inhabit a castle  or schloss.
Carmilla,a small income  in that part of the world  goes a great way.
Carmilla,eight or nine hundred a year does wonders.
Carmilla,scantily enough ours would have answered among wealthy people at home.
Carmilla,my father is english  and i bear an english name  although i never saw england.
Carmilla,but here  in this lonely and primitive place  where everything is so marvelously cheap  i really don   t see how ever so much more money would at all materially add to our comforts  or even luxuries.
Carmilla,my father was in the austrian service  and retired upon a pension and his patrimony  and purchased this feudal residence  and the small estate on which it stands  a bargain.
Carmilla,nothing can be more picturesque or solitary.
Carmilla,it stands on a slight eminence in a forest.
Carmilla,the road  very old and narrow  passes in front of its drawbridge  never raised in my time  and its moat  stocked with perch  and sailed over by many swans  and floating on its surface white fleets of water lilies.
Carmilla,over all this the schloss shows its many windowed front  its towers  and its gothic chapel.
Carmilla,the forest opens in an irregular and very picturesque glade before its gate  and at the right a steep gothic bridge carries the road over a stream that winds in deep shadow through the wood.
Carmilla,i have said that this is a very lonely place.
Carmilla,judge whether i say truth.
Carmilla,looking from the hall door towards the road  the forest in which our castle stands extends fifteen miles to the right  and twelve to the left.
Carmilla,the nearest inhabited village is about seven of your english miles to the left.
Carmilla,the nearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations  is that of old general spielsdorf  nearly twenty miles away to the right.
Carmilla,i have said    the nearest inhabited village    because there is  only three miles westward  that is to say in the direction of general spielsdorf   s schloss  a ruined village  with its quaint little church  now roofless  in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of the proud family of karnstein  now extinct  who once owned the equally desolate chateau which  in the thick of the forest  overlooks the silent ruins of the town.
Carmilla,respecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy spot  there is a legend which i shall relate to you another time.
Carmilla,i must tell you now  how very small is the party who constitute the inhabitants of our castle.
Carmilla,i don   t include servants  or those dependents who occupy rooms in the buildings attached to the schloss.
Carmilla,listen  and wonder  my father  who is the kindest man on earth  but growing old  and i  at the date of my story  only nineteen.
Carmilla,eight years have passed since then.
Carmilla,i and my father constituted the family at the schloss.
Carmilla,my mother  a styrian lady  died in my infancy  but i had a good natured governess  who had been with me from  i might almost say  my infancy.
Carmilla,i could not remember the time when her fat  benignant face was not a familiar picture in my memory.
Carmilla,this was madame perrodon  a native of berne  whose care and good nature now in part supplied to me the loss of my mother  whom i do not even remember  so early i lost her.
Carmilla,she made a third at our little dinner party.
Carmilla,there was a fourth  mademoiselle de lafontaine  a lady such as you term  i believe  a    finishing governess.
Carmilla,she spoke french and german  madame perrodon french and broken english  to which my father and i added english  which  partly to prevent its becoming a lost language among us  and partly from patriotic motives  we spoke every day.
Carmilla,the consequence was a babel  at which strangers used to laugh  and which i shall make no attempt to reproduce in this narrative.
Carmilla,and there were two or three young lady friends besides  pretty nearly of my own age  who were occasional visitors  for longer or shorter terms  and these visits i sometimes returned.
Carmilla,these were our regular social resources  but of course there were chance visits from    neighbors   of only five or six leagues distance.
Carmilla,my life was  notwithstanding  rather a solitary one  i can assure you.
Carmilla,my gouvernantes had just so much control over me as you might conjecture such sage persons would have in the case of a rather spoiled girl  whose only parent allowed her pretty nearly her own way in everything.
Carmilla,the first occurrence in my existence  which produced a terrible impression upon my mind  which  in fact  never has been effaced  was one of the very earliest incidents of my life which i can recollect.
Carmilla,some people will think it so trifling that it should not be recorded here.
Carmilla,you will see  however  by and by  why i mention it.
Carmilla,the nursery  as it was called  though i had it all to myself  was a large room in the upper story of the castle  with a steep oak roof.
Carmilla,i can   t have been more than six years old  when one night i awoke  and looking round the room from my bed  failed to see the nursery maid.
Carmilla,neither was my nurse there  and i thought myself alone.
Carmilla,i was not frightened  for i was one of those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories  of fairy tales  and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when the door cracks suddenly  or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall  nearer to our faces.
Carmilla,i was vexed and insulted at finding myself  as i conceived  neglected  and i began to whimper  preparatory to a hearty bout of roaring  when to my surprise  i saw a solemn  but very pretty face looking at me from the side of the bed.
Carmilla,it was that of a young lady who was kneeling  with her hands under the coverlet.
Carmilla,i looked at her with a kind of pleased wonder  and ceased whimpering.
Carmilla,she caressed me with her hands  and lay down beside me on the bed  and drew me towards her  smiling  i felt immediately delightfully soothed  and fell asleep again.
Carmilla,i was wakened by a sensation as if two needles ran into my breast very deep at the same moment  and i cried loudly.
Carmilla,the lady started back  with her eyes fixed on me  and then slipped down upon the floor  and  as i thought  hid herself under the bed.
Carmilla,i was now for the first time frightened  and i yelled with all my might and main.
Carmilla,nurse  nursery maid  housekeeper  all came running in  and hearing my story  they made light of it  soothing me all they could meanwhile.
Carmilla,but  child as i was  i could perceive that their faces were pale with an unwonted look of anxiety  and i saw them look under the bed  and about the room  and peep under tables and pluck open cupboards  and the housekeeper whispered to the nurse     lay your hand along that hollow in the bed  someone did lie there  so sure as you did not  the place is still warm.
Carmilla,i remember the nursery maid petting me  and all three examining my chest  where i told them i felt the puncture  and pronouncing that there was no sign visible that any such thing had happened to me.
Carmilla,the housekeeper and the two other servants who were in charge of the nursery  remained sitting up all night  and from that time a servant always sat up in the nursery until i was about fourteen.
Carmilla,i was very nervous for a long time after this.
Carmilla,a doctor was called in  he was pallid and elderly.
Carmilla,how well i remember his long saturnine face  slightly pitted with smallpox  and his chestnut wig.
Carmilla,for a good while  every second day  he came and gave me medicine  which of course i hated.
Carmilla,the morning after i saw this apparition i was in a state of terror  and could not bear to be left alone  daylight though it was  for a moment.
Carmilla,i remember my father coming up and standing at the bedside  and talking cheerfully  and asking the nurse a number of questions  and laughing very heartily at one of the answers  and patting me on the shoulder  and kissing me  and telling me not to be frightened  that it was nothing but a dream and could not hurt me.
Carmilla,but i was not comforted  for i knew the visit of the strange woman was not a dream  and i was awfully frightened.
Carmilla,i was a little consoled by the nursery maid   s assuring me that it was she who had come and looked at me  and lain down beside me in the bed  and that i must have been half dreaming not to have known her face.
Carmilla,but this  though supported by the nurse  did not quite satisfy me.
Carmilla,i remembered  in the course of that day  a venerable old man  in a black cassock  coming into the room with the nurse and housekeeper  and talking a little to them  and very kindly to me  his face was very sweet and gentle  and he told me they were going to pray  and joined my hands together  and desired me to say  softly  while they were praying     lord hear all good prayers for us  for jesus    sake.
Carmilla,i think these were the very words  for i often repeated them to myself  and my nurse used for years to make me say them in my prayers.
Carmilla,i remembered so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white haired old man  in his black cassock  as he stood in that rude  lofty  brown room  with the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred years old about him  and the scanty light entering its shadowy atmosphere through the small lattice.
Carmilla,he kneeled  and the three women with him  and he prayed aloud with an earnest quavering voice for  what appeared to me  a long time.
Carmilla,i forget all my life preceding that event  and for some time after it is all obscure also  but the scenes i have just described stand out vivid as the isolated pictures of the phantasmagoria surrounded by darkness.
Carmilla, i am now going to tell you something so strange that it will require all your faith in my veracity to believe my story.
Carmilla,it is not only true  nevertheless  but truth of which i have been an eyewitness.
Carmilla,it was a sweet summer evening  and my father asked me  as he sometimes did  to take a little ramble with him along that beautiful forest vista which i have mentioned as lying in front of the schloss.
Carmilla,general spielsdorf cannot come to us so soon as i had hoped    said my father  as we pursued our walk.
Carmilla,he was to have paid us a visit of some weeks  and we had expected his arrival next day.
Carmilla,he was to have brought with him a young lady  his niece and ward  mademoiselle rheinfeldt  whom i had never seen  but whom i had heard described as a very charming girl  and in whose society i had promised myself many happy days.
Carmilla,i was more disappointed than a young lady living in a town  or a bustling neighborhood can possibly imagine.
Carmilla,this visit  and the new acquaintance it promised  had furnished my day dream for many weeks.
Carmilla,and how soon does he come    i asked.
Carmilla,not till autumn.
Carmilla,not for two months  i dare say    he answered.
Carmilla,and i am very glad now  dear  that you never knew mademoiselle rheinfeldt.
Carmilla,and why    i asked  both mortified and curious.
Carmilla,because the poor young lady is dead    he replied.
Carmilla,i quite forgot i had not told you  but you were not in the room when i received the general   s letter this evening.
Carmilla,i was very much shocked.
Carmilla,general spielsdorf had mentioned in his first letter  six or seven weeks before  that she was not so well as he would wish her  but there was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion of danger.
Carmilla,here is the general   s letter    he said  handing it to me.
Carmilla,i am afraid he is in great affliction  the letter appears to me to have been written very nearly in distraction.
Carmilla,we sat down on a rude bench  under a group of magnificent lime trees.
Carmilla,the sun was setting with all its melancholy splendor behind the sylvan horizon  and the stream that flows beside our home  and passes under the steep old bridge i have mentioned  wound through many a group of noble trees  almost at our feet  reflecting in its current the fading crimson of the sky.
Carmilla,general spielsdorf   s letter was so extraordinary  so vehement  and in some places so self contradictory  that i read it twice over   the second time aloud to my father   and was still unable to account for it  except by supposing that grief had unsettled his mind.
Carmilla,it said    i have lost my darling daughter  for as such i loved her.
Carmilla,during the last days of dear bertha   s illness i was not able to write to you.
Carmilla,before then i had no idea of her danger.
Carmilla,i have lost her  and now learn all  too late.
Carmilla,she died in the peace of innocence  and in the glorious hope of a blessed futurity.
Carmilla,the fiend who betrayed our infatuated hospitality has done it all.
Carmilla,i thought i was receiving into my house innocence  gaiety  a charming companion for my lost bertha.
Carmilla,heavens  what a fool have i been   i thank god my child died without a suspicion of the cause of her sufferings.
Carmilla,she is gone without so much as conjecturing the nature of her illness  and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery.
Carmilla,i devote my remaining days to tracking and extinguishing a monster.
Carmilla,i am told i may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose.
Carmilla,at present there is scarcely a gleam of light to guide me.
Carmilla,i curse my conceited incredulity  my despicable affectation of superiority  my blindness  my obstinacy   all   too late.
Carmilla,i cannot write or talk collectedly now.
Carmilla,i am distracted.
Carmilla,so soon as i shall have a little recovered  i mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry  which may possibly lead me as far as vienna.
Carmilla,some time in the autumn  two months hence  or earlier if i live  i will see you   that is  if you permit me  i will then tell you all that i scarce dare put upon paper now.
Carmilla,farewell.
Carmilla,pray for me  dear friend.
Carmilla,in these terms ended this strange letter.
Carmilla,though i had never seen bertha rheinfeldt my eyes filled with tears at the sudden intelligence  i was startled  as well as profoundly disappointed.
Carmilla,the sun had now set  and it was twilight by the time i had returned the general   s letter to my father.
Carmilla,it was a soft clear evening  and we loitered  speculating upon the possible meanings of the violent and incoherent sentences which i had just been reading.
Carmilla,we had nearly a mile to walk before reaching the road that passes the schloss in front  and by that time the moon was shining brilliantly.
Carmilla,at the drawbridge we met madame perrodon and mademoiselle de lafontaine  who had come out  without their bonnets  to enjoy the exquisite moonlight.
Carmilla,we heard their voices gabbling in animated dialogue as we approached.
Carmilla,we joined them at the drawbridge  and turned about to admire with them the beautiful scene.
Carmilla,the glade through which we had just walked lay before us.
Carmilla,at our left the narrow road wound away under clumps of lordly trees  and was lost to sight amid the thickening forest.
Carmilla,at the right the same road crosses the steep and picturesque bridge  near which stands a ruined tower which once guarded that pass  and beyond the bridge an abrupt eminence rises  covered with trees  and showing in the shadows some grey ivy clustered rocks.
Carmilla,over the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like smoke  marking the distances with a transparent veil  and here and there we could see the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.
Carmilla,no softer  sweeter scene could be imagined.
Carmilla,the news i had just heard made it melancholy  but nothing could disturb its character of profound serenity  and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the prospect.
Carmilla,my father  who enjoyed the picturesque  and i  stood looking in silence over the expanse beneath us.
Carmilla,the two good governesses  standing a little way behind us  discoursed upon the scene  and were eloquent upon the moon.
Carmilla,madame perrodon was fat  middle aged  and romantic  and talked and sighed poetically.
Carmilla,mademoiselle de lafontaine   in right of her father who was a german  assumed to be psychological  metaphysical  and something of a mystic   now declared that when the moon shone with a light so intense it was well known that it indicated a special spiritual activity.
Carmilla,the effect of the full moon in such a state of brilliancy was manifold.
Carmilla,it acted on dreams  it acted on lunacy  it acted on nervous people  it had marvelous physical influences connected with life.
Carmilla,mademoiselle related that her cousin  who was mate of a merchant ship  having taken a nap on deck on such a night  lying on his back  with his face full in the light on the moon  had wakened  after a dream of an old woman clawing him by the cheek  with his features horribly drawn to one side  and his countenance had never quite recovered its equilibrium.
Carmilla,the moon  this night    she said     is full of idyllic and magnetic influence   and see  when you look behind you at the front of the schloss how all its windows flash and twinkle with that silvery splendor  as if unseen hands had lighted up the rooms to receive fairy guests.
Carmilla,there are indolent styles of the spirits in which  indisposed to talk ourselves  the talk of others is pleasant to our listless ears  and i gazed on  pleased with the tinkle of the ladies    conversation.
Carmilla,i have got into one of my moping moods tonight    said my father  after a silence  and quoting shakespeare  whom  by way of keeping up our english  he used to read aloud  he said         in truth i know not why i am so sad.
Carmilla,it wearies me  you say it wearies you  but how i got it   came by it.
Carmilla,i forget the rest.
Carmilla,but i feel as if some great misfortune were hanging over us.
Carmilla,i suppose the poor general   s afflicted letter has had something to do with it.
Carmilla,at this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheels and many hoofs upon the road  arrested our attention.
Carmilla,they seemed to be approaching from the high ground overlooking the bridge  and very soon the equipage emerged from that point.
Carmilla,two horsemen first crossed the bridge  then came a carriage drawn by four horses  and two men rode behind.
Carmilla,it seemed to be the traveling carriage of a person of rank  and we were all immediately absorbed in watching that very unusual spectacle.
Carmilla,it became  in a few moments  greatly more interesting  for just as the carriage had passed the summit of the steep bridge  one of the leaders  taking fright  communicated his panic to the rest  and after a plunge or two  the whole team broke into a wild gallop together  and dashing between the horsemen who rode in front  came thundering along the road towards us with the speed of a hurricane.
Carmilla,the excitement of the scene was made more painful by the clear  long drawn screams of a female voice from the carriage window.
Carmilla,we all advanced in curiosity and horror  me rather in silence  the rest with various ejaculations of terror.
Carmilla,our suspense did not last long.
Carmilla,just before you reach the castle drawbridge  on the route they were coming  there stands by the roadside a magnificent lime tree  on the other stands an ancient stone cross  at sight of which the horses  now going at a pace that was perfectly frightful  swerved so as to bring the wheel over the projecting roots of the tree.
Carmilla,i knew what was coming.
Carmilla,i covered my eyes  unable to see it out  and turned my head away  at the same moment i heard a cry from my lady friends  who had gone on a little.
Carmilla,curiosity opened my eyes  and i saw a scene of utter confusion.
Carmilla,two of the horses were on the ground  the carriage lay upon its side with two wheels in the air  the men were busy removing the traces  and a lady with a commanding air and figure had got out  and stood with clasped hands  raising the handkerchief that was in them every now and then to her eyes.
Carmilla,through the carriage door was now lifted a young lady  who appeared to be lifeless.
Carmilla,my dear old father was already beside the elder lady  with his hat in his hand  evidently tendering his aid and the resources of his schloss.
Carmilla,the lady did not appear to hear him  or to have eyes for anything but the slender girl who was being placed against the slope of the bank.
Carmilla,i approached  the young lady was apparently stunned  but she was certainly not dead.
Carmilla,my father  who piqued himself on being something of a physician  had just had his fingers on her wrist and assured the lady  who declared herself her mother  that her pulse  though faint and irregular  was undoubtedly still distinguishable.
Carmilla,the lady clasped her hands and looked upward  as if in a momentary transport of gratitude  but immediately she broke out again in that theatrical way which is  i believe  natural to some people.
Carmilla,she was what is called a fine looking woman for her time of life  and must have been handsome  she was tall  but not thin  and dressed in black velvet  and looked rather pale  but with a proud and commanding countenance  though now agitated strangely.
Carmilla,who was ever being so born to calamity    i heard her say  with clasped hands  as i came up.
Carmilla,here am i  on a journey of life and death  in prosecuting which to lose an hour is possibly to lose all.
Carmilla,my child will not have recovered sufficiently to resume her route for who can say how long.
Carmilla,i must leave her  i cannot  dare not  delay.
Carmilla,how far on  sir  can you tell  is the nearest village  i must leave her there  and shall not see my darling  or even hear of her till my return  three months hence.
Carmilla,i plucked my father by the coat  and whispered earnestly in his ear     oh  papa  pray ask her to let her stay with us   it would be so delightful.
Carmilla,do  pray.
Carmilla,if madame will entrust her child to the care of my daughter  and of her good gouvernante  madame perrodon  and permit her to remain as our guest  under my charge  until her return  it will confer a distinction and an obligation upon us  and we shall treat her with all the care and devotion which so sacred a trust deserves.
Carmilla,i cannot do that  sir  it would be to task your kindness and chivalry too cruelly    said the lady  distractedly.
Carmilla,it would  on the contrary  be to confer on us a very great kindness at the moment when we most need it.
Carmilla,my daughter has just been disappointed by a cruel misfortune  in a visit from which she had long anticipated a great deal of happiness.
Carmilla,if you confide this young lady to our care it will be her best consolation.
Carmilla,the nearest village on your route is distant  and affords no such inn as you could think of placing your daughter at  you cannot allow her to continue her journey for any considerable distance without danger.
Carmilla,if  as you say  you cannot suspend your journey  you must part with her tonight  and nowhere could you do so with more honest assurances of care and tenderness than here.
Carmilla,there was something in this lady   s air and appearance so distinguished and even imposing  and in her manner so engaging  as to impress one  quite apart from the dignity of her equipage  with a conviction that she was a person of consequence.
Carmilla,by this time the carriage was replaced in its upright position  and the horses  quite tractable  in the traces again.
Carmilla,the lady threw on her daughter a glance which i fancied was not quite so affectionate as one might have anticipated from the beginning of the scene  then she beckoned slightly to my father  and withdrew two or three steps with him out of hearing  and talked to him with a fixed and stern countenance  not at all like that with which she had hitherto spoken.
Carmilla,i was filled with wonder that my father did not seem to perceive the change  and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she was speaking  almost in his ear  with so much earnestness and rapidity.
Carmilla,two or three minutes at most i think she remained thus employed  then she turned  and a few steps brought her to where her daughter lay  supported by madame perrodon.
Carmilla,she kneeled beside her for a moment and whispered  as madame supposed  a little benediction in her ear  then hastily kissing her she stepped into her carriage  the door was closed  the footmen in stately liveries jumped up behind  the outriders spurred on  the postilions cracked their whips  the horses plunged and broke suddenly into a furious canter that threatened soon again to become a gallop  and the carriage whirled away  followed at the same rapid pace by the two horsemen in the rear.
Carmilla,we followed the cortege with our eyes until it was swiftly lost to sight in the misty wood  and the very sound of the hoofs and the wheels died away in the silent night air.
Carmilla,nothing remained to assure us that the adventure had not been an illusion of a moment but the young lady  who just at that moment opened her eyes.
Carmilla,i could not see  for her face was turned from me  but she raised her head  evidently looking about her  and i heard a very sweet voice ask complainingly     where is mamma     our good madame perrodon answered tenderly  and added some comfortable assurances.
Carmilla,i then heard her ask      where am i  what is this place    and after that she said     i don   t see the carriage  and matska  where is she     madame answered all her questions in so far as she understood them  and gradually the young lady remembered how the misadventure came about  and was glad to hear that no one in  or in attendance on  the carriage was hurt  and on learning that her mamma had left her here  till her return in about three months  she wept.
Carmilla,i was going to add my consolations to those of madame perrodon when mademoiselle de lafontaine placed her hand upon my arm  saying      don   t approach  one at a time is as much as she can at present converse with  a very little excitement would possibly overpower her now.
Carmilla,as soon as she is comfortably in bed  i thought  i will run up to her room and see her.
Carmilla,my father in the meantime had sent a servant on horseback for the physician  who lived about two leagues away  and a bedroom was being prepared for the young lady   s reception.
Carmilla,the stranger now rose  and leaning on madame   s arm  walked slowly over the drawbridge and into the castle gate.
Carmilla,in the hall  servants waited to receive her  and she was conducted forthwith to her room.
Carmilla,the room we usually sat in as our drawing room is long  having four windows  that looked over the moat and drawbridge  upon the forest scene i have just described.
Carmilla,it is furnished in old carved oak  with large carved cabinets  and the chairs are cushioned with crimson utrecht velvet.
Carmilla,the walls are covered with tapestry  and surrounded with great gold frames  the figures being as large as life  in ancient and very curious costume  and the subjects represented are hunting  hawking  and generally festive.
Carmilla,it is not too stately to be extremely comfortable  and here we had our tea  for with his usual patriotic leanings he insisted that the national beverage should make its appearance regularly with our coffee and chocolate.
Carmilla,we sat here this night  and with candles lighted  were talking over the adventure of the evening.
Carmilla,madame perrodon and mademoiselle de lafontaine were both of our party.
Carmilla,the young stranger had hardly lain down in her bed when she sank into a deep sleep  and those ladies had left her in the care of a servant.
Carmilla,how do you like our guest    i asked  as soon as madame entered.
Carmilla,tell me all about her        i like her extremely    answered madame     she is  i almost think  the prettiest creature i ever saw  about your age  and so gentle and nice.
Carmilla,she is absolutely beautiful    threw in mademoiselle  who had peeped for a moment into the stranger   s room.
Carmilla,and such a sweet voice    added madame perrodon.
Carmilla,did you remark a woman in the carriage  after it was set up again  who did not get out    inquired mademoiselle     but only looked from the window        no  we had not seen her.
Carmilla,then she described a hideous black woman  with a sort of colored turban on her head  and who was gazing all the time from the carriage window  nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies  with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs  and her teeth set as if in fury.
Carmilla,did you remark what an ill looking pack of men the servants were    asked madame.
Carmilla,yes    said my father  who had just come in     ugly  hang dog looking fellows as ever i beheld in my life.
Carmilla,i hope they mayn   t rob the poor lady in the forest.
Carmilla,they are clever rogues  however  they got everything to rights in a minute.
Carmilla,i dare say they are worn out with too long traveling    said madame.
Carmilla,besides looking wicked  their faces were so strangely lean  and dark  and sullen.
Carmilla,i am very curious  i own  but i dare say the young lady will tell you all about it tomorrow  if she is sufficiently recovered.
Carmilla,i don   t think she will    said my father  with a mysterious smile  and a little nod of his head  as if he knew more about it than he cared to tell us.
Carmilla,this made us all the more inquisitive as to what had passed between him and the lady in the black velvet  in the brief but earnest interview that had immediately preceded her departure.
Carmilla,we were scarcely alone  when i entreated him to tell me.
Carmilla,he did not need much pressing.
Carmilla,there is no particular reason why i should not tell you.
Carmilla,she expressed a reluctance to trouble us with the care of her daughter  saying she was in delicate health  and nervous  but not subject to any kind of seizure   she volunteered that   nor to any illusion  being  in fact  perfectly sane.
Carmilla,how very odd to say all that    i interpolated.
Carmilla,it was so unnecessary.
Carmilla,at all events it was said    he laughed     and as you wish to know all that passed  which was indeed very little  i tell you.
Carmilla,she then said     i am making a long journey of vital importance   she emphasized the word   rapid and secret  i shall return for my child in three months  in the meantime  she will be silent as to who we are  whence we come  and whither we are traveling.
Carmilla,that is all she said.
Carmilla,she spoke very pure french.
Carmilla,when she said the word    secret     she paused for a few seconds  looking sternly  her eyes fixed on mine.
Carmilla,i fancy she makes a great point of that.
Carmilla,you saw how quickly she was gone.
Carmilla,i hope i have not done a very foolish thing  in taking charge of the young lady.
Carmilla,for my part  i was delighted.
Carmilla,i was longing to see and talk to her  and only waiting till the doctor should give me leave.
Carmilla,you  who live in towns  can have no idea how great an event the introduction of a new friend is  in such a solitude as surrounded us.
Carmilla,the doctor did not arrive till nearly one o   clock  but i could no more have gone to my bed and slept  than i could have overtaken  on foot  the carriage in which the princess in black velvet had driven away.
Carmilla,when the physician came down to the drawing room  it was to report very favorably upon his patient.
Carmilla,she was now sitting up  her pulse quite regular  apparently perfectly well.
Carmilla,she had sustained no injury  and the little shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly.
Carmilla,there could be no harm certainly in my seeing her  if we both wished it  and  with this permission i sent  forthwith  to know whether she would allow me to visit her for a few minutes in her room.
Carmilla,the servant returned immediately to say that she desired nothing more.
Carmilla,you may be sure i was not long in availing myself of this permission.
Carmilla,our visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss.
Carmilla,it was  perhaps  a little stately.
Carmilla,there was a somber piece of tapestry opposite the foot of the bed  representing cleopatra with the asps to her bosom  and other solemn classic scenes were displayed  a little faded  upon the other walls.
Carmilla,but there was gold carving  and rich and varied color enough in the other decorations of the room  to more than redeem the gloom of the old tapestry.
Carmilla,there were candles at the bedside.
Carmilla,she was sitting up  her slender pretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown  embroidered with flowers  and lined with thick quilted silk  which her mother had thrown over her feet as she lay upon the ground.
Carmilla,what was it that  as i reached the bedside and had just begun my little greeting  struck me dumb in a moment  and made me recoil a step or two from before her  i will tell you.
Carmilla,i saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night  which remained so fixed in my memory  and on which i had for so many years so often ruminated with horror  when no one suspected of what i was thinking.
Carmilla,it was pretty  even beautiful  and when i first beheld it  wore the same melancholy expression.
Carmilla,but this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of recognition.
Carmilla,there was a silence of fully a minute  and then at length she spoke  i could not.
Carmilla,how wonderful    she exclaimed.
Carmilla,twelve years ago  i saw your face in a dream  and it has haunted me ever since.
Carmilla,wonderful indeed    i repeated  overcoming with an effort the horror that had for a time suspended my utterances.
Carmilla,twelve years ago  in vision or reality  i certainly saw you.
Carmilla,i could not forget your face.
Carmilla,it has remained before my eyes ever since.
Carmilla,her smile had softened.
Carmilla,whatever i had fancied strange in it  was gone  and it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and intelligent.
Carmilla,i felt reassured  and continued more in the vein which hospitality indicated  to bid her welcome  and to tell her how much pleasure her accidental arrival had given us all  and especially what a happiness it was to me.
Carmilla,i took her hand as i spoke.
Carmilla,i was a little shy  as lonely people are  but the situation made me eloquent  and even bold.
Carmilla,she pressed my hand  she laid hers upon it  and her eyes glowed  as  looking hastily into mine  she smiled again  and blushed.
Carmilla,she answered my welcome very prettily.
Carmilla,i sat down beside her  still wondering  and she said      i must tell you my vision about you  it is so very strange that you and i should have had  each of the other so vivid a dream  that each should have seen  i you and you me  looking as we do now  when of course we both were mere children.
Carmilla,i was a child  about six years old  and i awoke from a confused and troubled dream  and found myself in a room  unlike my nursery  wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood  and with cupboards and bedsteads  and chairs  and benches placed about it.
Carmilla,the beds were  i thought  all empty  and the room itself without anyone but myself in it  and i  after looking about me for some time  and admiring especially an iron candlestick with two branches  which i should certainly know again  crept under one of the beds to reach the window  but as i got from under the bed  i heard someone crying  and looking up  while i was still upon my knees  i saw you   most assuredly you   as i see you now  a beautiful young lady  with golden hair and large blue eyes  and lips   your lips   you as you are here.
Carmilla,your looks won me  i climbed on the bed and put my arms about you  and i think we both fell asleep.
Carmilla,i was aroused by a scream  you were sitting up screaming.
Carmilla,i was frightened  and slipped down upon the ground  and  it seemed to me  lost consciousness for a moment  and when i came to myself  i was again in my nursery at home.
Carmilla,your face i have never forgotten since.
Carmilla,i could not be misled by mere resemblance.
Carmilla,you are the lady whom i saw then.
Carmilla,it was now my turn to relate my corresponding vision  which i did  to the undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance.
Carmilla,i don   t know which should be most afraid of the other    she said  again smiling      if you were less pretty i think i should be very much afraid of you  but being as you are  and you and i both so young  i feel only that i have made your acquaintance twelve years ago  and have already a right to your intimacy  at all events it does seem as if we were destined  from our earliest childhood  to be friends.
Carmilla,i wonder whether you feel as strangely drawn towards me as i do to you  i have never had a friend   shall i find one now    she sighed  and her fine dark eyes gazed passionately on me.
Carmilla,now the truth is  i felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful stranger.
Carmilla,i did feel  as she said     drawn towards her    but there was also something of repulsion.
Carmilla,in this ambiguous feeling  however  the sense of attraction immensely prevailed.
Carmilla,she interested and won me  she was so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.
Carmilla,i perceived now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over her  and hastened to bid her good night.
Carmilla,the doctor thinks    i added     that you ought to have a maid to sit up with you tonight  one of ours is waiting  and you will find her a very useful and quiet creature.
Carmilla,how kind of you  but i could not sleep  i never could with an attendant in the room.
Carmilla,i shan   t require any assistance   and  shall i confess my weakness  i am haunted with a terror of robbers.
Carmilla,our house was robbed once  and two servants murdered  so i always lock my door.
Carmilla,it has become a habit   and you look so kind i know you will forgive me.
Carmilla,i see there is a key in the lock.
Carmilla,she held me close in her pretty arms for a moment and whispered in my ear     good night  darling  it is very hard to part with you  but good night  tomorrow  but not early  i shall see you again.
Carmilla,she sank back on the pillow with a sigh  and her fine eyes followed me with a fond and melancholy gaze  and she murmured again    good night  dear friend.
Carmilla,young people like  and even love  on impulse.
Carmilla,i was flattered by the evident  though as yet undeserved  fondness she showed me.
Carmilla,i liked the confidence with which she at once received me.
Carmilla,she was determined that we should be very near friends.
Carmilla,next day came and we met again.
Carmilla,i was delighted with my companion  that is to say  in many respects.
Carmilla,her looks lost nothing in daylight   she was certainly the most beautiful creature i had ever seen  and the unpleasant remembrance of the face presented in my early dream  had lost the effect of the first unexpected recognition.
Carmilla,she confessed that she had experienced a similar shock on seeing me  and precisely the same faint antipathy that had mingled with my admiration of her.
Carmilla,we now laughed together over our momentary horrors.
Carmilla,i told you that i was charmed with her in most particulars.
Carmilla,there were some that did not please me so well.
Carmilla,she was above the middle height of women.
Carmilla,i shall begin by describing her.
Carmilla,she was slender  and wonderfully graceful.
Carmilla,except that her movements were languid   very languid   indeed  there was nothing in her appearance to indicate an invalid.
Carmilla,her complexion was rich and brilliant  her features were small and beautifully formed  her eyes large  dark  and lustrous  her hair was quite wonderful  i never saw hair so magnificently thick and long when it was down about her shoulders  i have often placed my hands under it  and laughed with wonder at its weight.
Carmilla,it was exquisitely fine and soft  and in color a rich very dark brown  with something of gold.
Carmilla,i loved to let it down  tumbling with its own weight  as  in her room  she lay back in her chair talking in her sweet low voice  i used to fold and braid it  and spread it out and play with it.
Carmilla,heavens  if i had but known all   i said there were particulars which did not please me.
Carmilla,i have told you that her confidence won me the first night i saw her  but i found that she exercised with respect to herself  her mother  her history  everything in fact connected with her life  plans  and people  an ever wakeful reserve.
Carmilla,i dare say i was unreasonable  perhaps i was wrong  i dare say i ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my father by the stately lady in black velvet.
Carmilla,but curiosity is a restless and unscrupulous passion  and no one girl can endure  with patience  that hers should be baffled by another.
Carmilla,what harm could it do anyone to tell me what i so ardently desired to know  had she no trust in my good sense or honor  why would she not believe me when i assured her  so solemnly  that i would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to any mortal breathing.
Carmilla,there was a coldness  it seemed to me  beyond her years  in her smiling melancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of light.
Carmilla,i cannot say we quarreled upon this point  for she would not quarrel upon any.
Carmilla,it was  of course  very unfair of me to press her  very ill bred  but i really could not help it  and i might just as well have let it alone.
Carmilla,what she did tell me amounted  in my unconscionable estimation   to nothing.
Carmilla,it was all summed up in three very vague disclosures   first   her name was carmilla.
Carmilla,second   her family was very ancient and noble.
Carmilla,third   her home lay in the direction of the west.
Carmilla,she would not tell me the name of her family  nor their armorial bearings  nor the name of their estate  nor even that of the country they lived in.
Carmilla,you are not to suppose that i worried her incessantly on these subjects.
Carmilla,i watched opportunity  and rather insinuated than urged my inquiries.
Carmilla,once or twice  indeed  i did attack her more directly.
Carmilla,but no matter what my tactics  utter failure was invariably the result.
Carmilla,reproaches and caresses were all lost upon her.
Carmilla,but i must add this  that her evasion was conducted with so pretty a melancholy and deprecation  with so many  and even passionate declarations of her liking for me  and trust in my honor  and with so many promises that i should at last know all  that i could not find it in my heart long to be offended with her.
Carmilla,she used to place her pretty arms about my neck  draw me to her  and laying her cheek to mine  murmur with her lips near my ear     dearest  your little heart is wounded  think me not cruel because i obey the irresistible law of my strength and weakness  if your dear heart is wounded  my wild heart bleeds with yours.
Carmilla,in the rapture of my enormous humiliation i live in your warm life  and you shall die   die  sweetly die   into mine.
Carmilla,i cannot help it  as i draw near to you  you  in your turn  will draw near to others  and learn the rapture of that cruelty  which yet is love  so  for a while  seek to know no more of me and mine  but trust me with all your loving spirit.
Carmilla,and when she had spoken such a rhapsody  she would press me more closely in her trembling embrace  and her lips in soft kisses gently glow upon my cheek.
Carmilla,her agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.
Carmilla,from these foolish embraces  which were not of very frequent occurrence  i must allow  i used to wish to extricate myself  but my energies seemed to fail me.
Carmilla,her murmured words sounded like a lullaby in my ear  and soothed my resistance into a trance  from which i only seemed to recover myself when she withdrew her arms.
Carmilla,in these mysterious moods i did not like her.
Carmilla,i experienced a strange tumultuous excitement that was pleasurable  ever and anon  mingled with a vague sense of fear and disgust.
Carmilla,i had no distinct thoughts about her while such scenes lasted  but i was conscious of a love growing into adoration  and also of abhorrence.
Carmilla,this i know is paradox  but i can make no other attempt to explain the feeling.
Carmilla,i now write  after an interval of more than ten years  with a trembling hand  with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrences and situations  in the ordeal through which i was unconsciously passing  though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main current of my story.
Carmilla,but  i suspect  in all lives there are certain emotional scenes  those in which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused  that are of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.
Carmilla,sometimes after an hour of apathy  my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure  renewed again and again  blushing softly  gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes  and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration.
Carmilla,it was like the ardor of a lover  it embarrassed me  it was hateful and yet over powering  and with gloating eyes she drew me to her  and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses  and she would whisper  almost in sobs     you are mine  you shall be mine  you and i are one for ever.
Carmilla,then she had thrown herself back in her chair  with her small hands over her eyes  leaving me trembling.
Carmilla,are we related    i used to ask     what can you mean by all this  i remind you perhaps of someone whom you love  but you must not  i hate it  i don   t know you   i don   t know myself when you look so and talk so.
Carmilla,she used to sigh at my vehemence  then turn away and drop my hand.
Carmilla,respecting these very extraordinary manifestations i strove in vain to form any satisfactory theory   i could not refer them to affectation or trick.
Carmilla,it was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of suppressed instinct and emotion.
Carmilla,was she  notwithstanding her mother   s volunteered denial  subject to brief visitations of insanity  or was there here a disguise and a romance  i had read in old storybooks of such things.
Carmilla,what if a boyish lover had found his way into the house  and sought to prosecute his suit in masquerade  with the assistance of a clever old adventuress.
Carmilla,but there were many things against this hypothesis  highly interesting as it was to my vanity.
Carmilla,i could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry delights to offer.
Carmilla,between these passionate moments there were long intervals of commonplace  of gaiety  of brooding melancholy  during which  except that i detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire  following me  at times i might have been as nothing to her.
Carmilla,except in these brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish  and there was always a languor about her  quite incompatible with a masculine system in a state of health.
Carmilla,in some respects her habits were odd.
Carmilla,perhaps not so singular in the opinion of a town lady like you  as they appeared to us rustic people.
Carmilla,she used to come down very late  generally not till one o   clock  she would then take a cup of chocolate  but eat nothing  we then went out for a walk  which was a mere saunter  and she seemed  almost immediately  exhausted  and either returned to the schloss or sat on one of the benches that were placed  here and there  among the trees.
Carmilla,this was a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize.
Carmilla,she was always an animated talker  and very intelligent.
Carmilla,she sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home  or mentioned an adventure or situation  or an early recollection  which indicated a people of strange manners  and described customs of which we knew nothing.
Carmilla,i gathered from these chance hints that her native country was much more remote than i had at first fancied.
Carmilla,as we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by.
Carmilla,it was that of a pretty young girl  whom i had often seen  the daughter of one of the rangers of the forest.
Carmilla,the poor man was walking behind the coffin of his darling  she was his only child  and he looked quite heartbroken.
Carmilla,peasants walking two and two came behind  they were singing a funeral hymn.
Carmilla,i rose to mark my respect as they passed  and joined in the hymn they were very sweetly singing.
Carmilla,my companion shook me a little roughly  and i turned surprised.
Carmilla,she said brusquely     don   t you perceive how discordant that is        i think it very sweet  on the contrary    i answered  vexed at the interruption  and very uncomfortable  lest the people who composed the little procession should observe and resent what was passing.
Carmilla,i resumed  therefore  instantly  and was again interrupted.
Carmilla,you pierce my ears    said carmilla  almost angrily  and stopping her ears with her tiny fingers.
Carmilla,besides  how can you tell that your religion and mine are the same  your forms wound me  and i hate funerals.
Carmilla,what a fuss  why you must die   everyone must die  and all are happier when they do.
Carmilla,come home.
Carmilla,my father has gone on with the clergyman to the churchyard.
Carmilla,i thought you knew she was to be buried today.
Carmilla,she  i don   t trouble my head about peasants.
Carmilla,i don   t know who she is    answered carmilla  with a flash from her fine eyes.
Carmilla,she is the poor girl who fancied she saw a ghost a fortnight ago  and has been dying ever since  till yesterday  when she expired.
Carmilla,tell me nothing about ghosts.
Carmilla,i shan   t sleep tonight if you do.
Carmilla,i hope there is no plague or fever coming  all this looks very like it    i continued.
Carmilla,the swineherd   s young wife died only a week ago  and she thought something seized her by the throat as she lay in her bed  and nearly strangled her.
Carmilla,papa says such horrible fancies do accompany some forms of fever.
Carmilla,she was quite well the day before.
Carmilla,she sank afterwards  and died before a week.
Carmilla,well  her funeral is over  i hope  and her hymn sung  and our ears shan   t be tortured with that discord and jargon.
Carmilla,it has made me nervous.
Carmilla,sit down here  beside me  sit close  hold my hand  press it hard hard harder.
Carmilla,we had moved a little back  and had come to another seat.
Carmilla,she sat down.
Carmilla,her face underwent a change that alarmed and even terrified me for a moment.
Carmilla,it darkened  and became horribly livid  her teeth and hands were clenched  and she frowned and compressed her lips  while she stared down upon the ground at her feet  and trembled all over with a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague.
Carmilla,all her energies seemed strained to suppress a fit  with which she was then breathlessly tugging  and at length a low convulsive cry of suffering broke from her  and gradually the hysteria subsided.
Carmilla,there  that comes of strangling people with hymns    she said at last.
Carmilla,hold me  hold me still.
Carmilla,it is passing away.
Carmilla,and so gradually it did  and perhaps to dissipate the somber impression which the spectacle had left upon me  she became unusually animated and chatty  and so we got home.
Carmilla,this was the first time i had seen her exhibit any definable symptoms of that delicacy of health which her mother had spoken of.
Carmilla,it was the first time  also  i had seen her exhibit anything like temper.
Carmilla,both passed away like a summer cloud  and never but once afterwards did i witness on her part a momentary sign of anger.
Carmilla,i will tell you how it happened.
Carmilla,she and i were looking out of one of the long drawing room windows  when there entered the courtyard  over the drawbridge  a figure of a wanderer whom i knew very well.
Carmilla,he used to visit the schloss generally twice a year.
Carmilla,it was the figure of a hunchback  with the sharp lean features that generally accompany deformity.
Carmilla,he wore a pointed black beard  and he was smiling from ear to ear  showing his white fangs.
Carmilla,he was dressed in buff  black  and scarlet  and crossed with more straps and belts than i could count  from which hung all manner of things.
Carmilla,behind  he carried a magic lantern  and two boxes  which i well knew  in one of which was a salamander  and in the other a mandrake.
Carmilla,these monsters used to make my father laugh.
Carmilla,they were compounded of parts of monkeys  parrots  squirrels  fish  and hedgehogs  dried and stitched together with great neatness and startling effect.
Carmilla,he had a fiddle  a box of conjuring apparatus  a pair of foils and masks attached to his belt  several other mysterious cases dangling about him  and a black staff with copper ferrules in his hand.
Carmilla,his companion was a rough spare dog  that followed at his heels  but stopped short  suspiciously at the drawbridge  and in a little while began to howl dismally.
Carmilla,in the meantime  the mountebank  standing in the midst of the courtyard  raised his grotesque hat  and made us a very ceremonious bow  paying his compliments very volubly in execrable french  and german not much better.
Carmilla,then  disengaging his fiddle  he began to scrape a lively air to which he sang with a merry discord  dancing with ludicrous airs and activity  that made me laugh  in spite of the dog   s howling.
Carmilla,then he advanced to the window with many smiles and salutations  and his hat in his left hand  his fiddle under his arm  and with a fluency that never took breath  he gabbled a long advertisement of all his accomplishments  and the resources of the various arts which he placed at our service  and the curiosities and entertainments which it was in his power  at our bidding  to display.
Carmilla,will your ladyships be pleased to buy an amulet against the oupire  which is going like the wolf  i hear  through these woods    he said dropping his hat on the pavement.
Carmilla,they are dying of it right and left and here is a charm that never fails  only pinned to the pillow  and you may laugh in his face.
Carmilla,these charms consisted of oblong slips of vellum  with cabalistic ciphers and diagrams upon them.
Carmilla,carmilla instantly purchased one  and so did i.
Carmilla,he was looking up  and we were smiling down upon him  amused  at least  i can answer for myself.
Carmilla,his piercing black eye  as he looked up in our faces  seemed to detect something that fixed for a moment his curiosity   in an instant he unrolled a leather case  full of all manner of odd little steel instruments.
Carmilla,see here  my lady    he said  displaying it  and addressing me     i profess  among other things less useful  the art of dentistry.
Carmilla,plague take the dog    he interpolated.
Carmilla,silence  beast  he howls so that your ladyships can scarcely hear a word.
Carmilla,your noble friend  the young lady at your right  has the sharpest tooth    long  thin  pointed  like an awl  like a needle  ha  ha  with my sharp and long sight  as i look up  i have seen it distinctly  now if it happens to hurt the young lady  and i think it must  here am i  here are my file  my punch  my nippers  i will make it round and blunt  if her ladyship pleases  no longer the tooth of a fish  but of a beautiful young lady as she is.
Carmilla,hey  is the young lady displeased  have i been too bold  have i offended her     the young lady  indeed  looked very angry as she drew back from the window.
Carmilla,how dares that mountebank insult us so  where is your father  i shall demand redress from him.
Carmilla,my father would have had the wretch tied up to the pump  and flogged with a cart whip  and burnt to the bones with the cattle brand     she retired from the window a step or two  and sat down  and had hardly lost sight of the offender  when her wrath subsided as suddenly as it had risen  and she gradually recovered her usual tone  and seemed to forget the little hunchback and his follies.
Carmilla,my father was out of spirits that evening.
Carmilla,on coming in he told us that there had been another case very similar to the two fatal ones which had lately occurred.
Carmilla,the sister of a young peasant on his estate  only a mile away  was very ill  had been  as she described it  attacked very nearly in the same way  and was now slowly but steadily sinking.
Carmilla,all this    said my father     is strictly referable to natural causes.
Carmilla,these poor people infect one another with their superstitions  and so repeat in imagination the images of terror that have infested their neighbors.
Carmilla,but that very circumstance frightens one horribly    said carmilla.
Carmilla,how so    inquired my father.
Carmilla,i am so afraid of fancying i see such things  i think it would be as bad as reality.
Carmilla,we are in god   s hands  nothing can happen without his permission  and all will end well for those who love him.
Carmilla,he is our faithful creator  he has made us all  and will take care of us.
Carmilla,creator  nature    said the young lady in answer to my gentle father.
Carmilla,and this disease that invades the country is natural.
Carmilla,nature.
Carmilla,all things proceed from nature   don   t they  all things in the heaven  in the earth  and under the earth  act and live as nature ordains  i think so.
Carmilla,the doctor said he would come here today    said my father  after a silence.
Carmilla,i want to know what he thinks about it  and what he thinks we had better do.
Carmilla,doctors never did me any good    said carmilla.
Carmilla,then you have been ill    i asked.
Carmilla,more ill than ever you were    she answered.
Carmilla,long ago        yes  a long time.
Carmilla,i suffered from this very illness  but i forget all but my pain and weakness  and they were not so bad as are suffered in other diseases.
Carmilla,you were very young then        i dare say  let us talk no more of it.
Carmilla,you would not wound a friend     she looked languidly in my eyes  and passed her arm round my waist lovingly  and led me out of the room.
Carmilla,my father was busy over some papers near the window.
Carmilla,why does your papa like to frighten us    said the pretty girl with a sigh and a little shudder.
Carmilla,he doesn   t  dear carmilla  it is the very furthest thing from his mind.
Carmilla,are you afraid  dearest        i should be very much if i fancied there was any real danger of my being attacked as those poor people were.
Carmilla,you are afraid to die        yes  every one is.
Carmilla,but to die as lovers may   to die together  so that they may live together.
Carmilla,girls are caterpillars while they live in the world  to be finally butterflies when the summer comes  but in the meantime there are grubs and larvae  don   t you see   each with their peculiar propensities  necessities and structure.
Carmilla,so says monsieur buffon  in his big book  in the next room.
Carmilla,later in the day the doctor came  and was closeted with papa for some time.
Carmilla,he was a skilful man  of sixty and upwards  he wore powder  and shaved his pale face as smooth as a pumpkin.
Carmilla,he and papa emerged from the room together  and i heard papa laugh  and say as they came out      well  i do wonder at a wise man like you.
Carmilla,what do you say to hippogriffs and dragons     the doctor was smiling  and made answer  shaking his head        nevertheless life and death are mysterious states  and we know little of the resources of either.
Carmilla,and so they walked on  and i heard no more.
Carmilla,i did not then know what the doctor had been broaching  but i think i guess it now.
Carmilla,this evening there arrived from gratz the grave  dark faced son of the picture cleaner  with a horse and cart laden with two large packing cases  having many pictures in each.
Carmilla,it was a journey of ten leagues  and whenever a messenger arrived at the schloss from our little capital of gratz  we used to crowd about him in the hall  to hear the news.
Carmilla,this arrival created in our secluded quarters quite a sensation.
Carmilla,the cases remained in the hall  and the messenger was taken charge of by the servants till he had eaten his supper.
Carmilla,then with assistants  and armed with hammer  ripping chisel  and turnscrew  he met us in the hall  where we had assembled to witness the unpacking of the cases.
Carmilla,carmilla sat looking listlessly on  while one after the other the old pictures  nearly all portraits  which had undergone the process of renovation  were brought to light.
Carmilla,my mother was of an old hungarian family  and most of these pictures  which were about to be restored to their places  had come to us through her.
Carmilla,my father had a list in his hand  from which he read  as the artist rummaged out the corresponding numbers.
Carmilla,i don   t know that the pictures were very good  but they were  undoubtedly  very old  and some of them very curious also.
Carmilla,they had  for the most part  the merit of being now seen by me  i may say  for the first time  for the smoke and dust of time had all but obliterated them.
Carmilla,there is a picture that i have not seen yet    said my father.
Carmilla,in one corner  at the top of it  is the name  as well as i could read     marcia karnstein     and the date             and i am curious to see how it has turned out.
Carmilla,i remembered it  it was a small picture  about a foot and a half high  and nearly square  without a frame  but it was so blackened by age that i could not make it out.
Carmilla,the artist now produced it  with evident pride.
Carmilla,it was quite beautiful  it was startling  it seemed to live.
Carmilla,it was the effigy of carmilla      carmilla  dear  here is an absolute miracle.
Carmilla,here you are  living  smiling  ready to speak  in this picture.
Carmilla,isn   t it beautiful  papa  and see  even the little mole on her throat.
Carmilla,my father laughed  and said    certainly it is a wonderful likeness    but he looked away  and to my surprise seemed but little struck by it  and went on talking to the picture cleaner  who was also something of an artist  and discoursed with intelligence about the portraits or other works  which his art had just brought into light and color  while i was more and more lost in wonder the more i looked at the picture.
Carmilla,will you let me hang this picture in my room  papa    i asked.
Carmilla,certainly  dear    said he  smiling     i   m very glad you think it so like.
Carmilla,it must be prettier even than i thought it  if it is.
Carmilla,the young lady did not acknowledge this pretty speech  did not seem to hear it.
Carmilla,she was leaning back in her seat  her fine eyes under their long lashes gazing on me in contemplation  and she smiled in a kind of rapture.
Carmilla,and now you can read quite plainly the name that is written in the corner.
Carmilla,it is not marcia  it looks as if it was done in gold.
Carmilla,the name is mircalla  countess karnstein  and this is a little coronet over and underneath a.d.      .
Carmilla,i am descended from the karnsteins  that is  mamma was.
Carmilla,ah    said the lady  languidly     so am i  i think  a very long descent  very ancient.
Carmilla,are there any karnsteins living now        none who bear the name  i believe.
Carmilla,the family were ruined  i believe  in some civil wars  long ago  but the ruins of the castle are only about three miles away.
Carmilla,how interesting    she said  languidly.
Carmilla,but see what beautiful moonlight    she glanced through the hall door  which stood a little open.
Carmilla,suppose you take a little ramble round the court  and look down at the road and river.
Carmilla,it is so like the night you came to us    i said.
Carmilla,she sighed  smiling.
Carmilla,she rose  and each with her arm about the other   s waist  we walked out upon the pavement.
Carmilla,in silence  slowly we walked down to the drawbridge  where the beautiful landscape opened before us.
Carmilla,and so you were thinking of the night i came here    she almost whispered.
Carmilla,are you glad i came        delighted  dear carmilla    i answered.
Carmilla,and you asked for the picture you think like me  to hang in your room    she murmured with a sigh  as she drew her arm closer about my waist  and let her pretty head sink upon my shoulder.
Carmilla,how romantic you are  carmilla    i said.
Carmilla,whenever you tell me your story  it will be made up chiefly of some one great romance.
Carmilla,she kissed me silently.
Carmilla,i am sure  carmilla  you have been in love  that there is  at this moment  an affair of the heart going on.
Carmilla,i have been in love with no one  and never shall    she whispered     unless it should be with you.
Carmilla,how beautiful she looked in the moonlight   shy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in my neck and hair  with tumultuous sighs  that seemed almost to sob  and pressed in mine a hand that trembled.
Carmilla,her soft cheek was glowing against mine.
Carmilla,darling  darling    she murmured     i live in you  and you would die for me  i love you so.
Carmilla,i started from her.
Carmilla,she was gazing on me with eyes from which all fire  all meaning had flown  and a face colorless and apathetic.
Carmilla,is there a chill in the air  dear    she said drowsily.
Carmilla,i almost shiver  have i been dreaming  let us come in.
Carmilla,come  come  come in.
Carmilla,you look ill  carmilla  a little faint.
Carmilla,you certainly must take some wine    i said.
Carmilla,yes.
Carmilla,i will.
Carmilla,i   m better now.
Carmilla,i shall be quite well in a few minutes.
Carmilla,yes  do give me a little wine    answered carmilla  as we approached the door.
Carmilla,let us look again for a moment  it is the last time  perhaps  i shall see the moonlight with you.
Carmilla,how do you feel now  dear carmilla  are you really better    i asked.
Carmilla,i was beginning to take alarm  lest she should have been stricken with the strange epidemic that they said had invaded the country about us.
Carmilla,papa would be grieved beyond measure    i added     if he thought you were ever so little ill  without immediately letting us know.
Carmilla,we have a very skilful doctor near us  the physician who was with papa today.
Carmilla,i   m sure he is.
Carmilla,i know how kind you all are  but  dear child  i am quite well again.
Carmilla,there is nothing ever wrong with me  but a little weakness.
Carmilla,people say i am languid  i am incapable of exertion  i can scarcely walk as far as a child of three years old  and every now and then the little strength i have falters  and i become as you have just seen me.
Carmilla,but after all i am very easily set up again  in a moment i am perfectly myself.
Carmilla,see how i have recovered.
Carmilla,so  indeed  she had  and she and i talked a great deal  and very animated she was  and the remainder of that evening passed without any recurrence of what i called her infatuations.
Carmilla,i mean her crazy talk and looks  which embarrassed  and even frightened me.
Carmilla,but there occurred that night an event which gave my thoughts quite a new turn  and seemed to startle even carmilla   s languid nature into momentary energy.
Carmilla,when we got into the drawing room  and had sat down to our coffee and chocolate  although carmilla did not take any  she seemed quite herself again  and madame  and mademoiselle de lafontaine  joined us  and made a little card party  in the course of which papa came in for what he called his    dish of tea.
Carmilla,when the game was over he sat down beside carmilla on the sofa  and asked her  a little anxiously  whether she had heard from her mother since her arrival.
Carmilla,she answered    no.
Carmilla,he then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at present.
Carmilla,i cannot tell    she answered ambiguously     but i have been thinking of leaving you  you have been already too hospitable and too kind to me.
Carmilla,i have given you an infinity of trouble  and i should wish to take a carriage tomorrow  and post in pursuit of her  i know where i shall ultimately find her  although i dare not yet tell you.
Carmilla,but you must not dream of any such thing    exclaimed my father  to my great relief.
Carmilla,we can   t afford to lose you so  and i won   t consent to your leaving us  except under the care of your mother  who was so good as to consent to your remaining with us till she should herself return.
Carmilla,i should be quite happy if i knew that you heard from her  but this evening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease that has invaded our neighborhood  grow even more alarming  and my beautiful guest  i do feel the responsibility  unaided by advice from your mother  very much.
Carmilla,but i shall do my best  and one thing is certain  that you must not think of leaving us without her distinct direction to that effect.
Carmilla,we should suffer too much in parting from you to consent to it easily.
Carmilla,thank you  sir  a thousand times for your hospitality    she answered  smiling bashfully.
Carmilla,you have all been too kind to me  i have seldom been so happy in all my life before  as in your beautiful chateau  under your care  and in the society of your dear daughter.
Carmilla,so he gallantly  in his old fashioned way  kissed her hand  smiling and pleased at her little speech.
Carmilla,i accompanied carmilla as usual to her room  and sat and chatted with her while she was preparing for bed.
Carmilla,do you think    i said at length     that you will ever confide fully in me     she turned round smiling  but made no answer  only continued to smile on me.
Carmilla,you won   t answer that    i said.
Carmilla,you can   t answer pleasantly  i ought not to have asked you.
Carmilla,you were quite right to ask me that  or anything.
Carmilla,you do not know how dear you are to me  or you could not think any confidence too great to look for.
Carmilla,but i am under vows  no nun half so awfully  and i dare not tell my story yet  even to you.
Carmilla,the time is very near when you shall know everything.
Carmilla,you will think me cruel  very selfish  but love is always selfish  the more ardent the more selfish.
Carmilla,how jealous i am you cannot know.
Carmilla,you must come with me  loving me  to death  or else hate me and still come with me.
Carmilla,and hating me through death and after.
Carmilla,there is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.
Carmilla,now  carmilla  you are going to talk your wild nonsense again    i said hastily.
Carmilla,not i  silly little fool as i am  and full of whims and fancies  for your sake i   ll talk like a sage.
Carmilla,were you ever at a ball        no  how you do run on.
Carmilla,what is it like  how charming it must be.
Carmilla,i almost forget  it is years ago.
Carmilla,i laughed.
Carmilla,you are not so old.
Carmilla,your first ball can hardly be forgotten yet.
Carmilla,i remember everything about it   with an effort.
Carmilla,i see it all  as divers see what is going on above them  through a medium  dense  rippling  but transparent.
Carmilla,there occurred that night what has confused the picture  and made its colours faint.
Carmilla,i was all but assassinated in my bed  wounded here    she touched her breast     and never was the same since.
Carmilla,were you near dying        yes  very   a cruel love   strange love  that would have taken my life.
Carmilla,love will have its sacrifices.
Carmilla,no sacrifice without blood.
Carmilla,let us go to sleep now  i feel so lazy.
Carmilla,how can i get up just now and lock my door     she was lying with her tiny hands buried in her rich wavy hair  under her cheek  her little head upon the pillow  and her glittering eyes followed me wherever i moved  with a kind of shy smile that i could not decipher.
Carmilla,i bid her good night  and crept from the room with an uncomfortable sensation.
Carmilla,i often wondered whether our pretty guest ever said her prayers.
Carmilla,i certainly had never seen her upon her knees.
Carmilla,in the morning she never came down until long after our family prayers were over  and at night she never left the drawing room to attend our brief evening prayers in the hall.
Carmilla,if it had not been that it had casually come out in one of our careless talks that she had been baptised  i should have doubted her being a christian.
Carmilla,religion was a subject on which i had never heard her speak a word.
Carmilla,if i had known the world better  this particular neglect or antipathy would not have so much surprised me.
Carmilla,the precautions of nervous people are infectious  and persons of a like temperament are pretty sure  after a time  to imitate them.
Carmilla,i had adopted carmilla   s habit of locking her bedroom door  having taken into my head all her whimsical alarms about midnight invaders and prowling assassins.
Carmilla,i had also adopted her precaution of making a brief search through her room  to satisfy herself that no lurking assassin or robber was    ensconced.
Carmilla,these wise measures taken  i got into my bed and fell asleep.
Carmilla,a light was burning in my room.
Carmilla,this was an old habit  of very early date  and which nothing could have tempted me to dispense with.
Carmilla,thus fortifed i might take my rest in peace.
Carmilla,but dreams come through stone walls  light up dark rooms  or darken light ones  and their persons make their exits and their entrances as they please  and laugh at locksmiths.
Carmilla,i had a dream that night that was the beginning of a very strange agony.
Carmilla,i cannot call it a nightmare  for i was quite conscious of being asleep.
Carmilla,but i was equally conscious of being in my room  and lying in bed  precisely as i actually was.
Carmilla,i saw  or fancied i saw  the room and its furniture just as i had seen it last  except that it was very dark  and i saw something moving round the foot of the bed  which at first i could not accurately distinguish.
Carmilla,but i soon saw that it was a sooty black animal that resembled a monstrous cat.
Carmilla,it appeared to me about four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the hearthrug as it passed over it  and it continued to ing and fro ing with the lithe  sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage.
Carmilla,i could not cry out  although as you may suppose  i was terrified.
Carmilla,its pace was growing faster  and the room rapidly darker and darker  and at length so dark that i could no longer see anything of it but its eyes.
Carmilla,i felt it spring lightly on the bed.
Carmilla,the two broad eyes approached my face  and suddenly i felt a stinging pain as if two large needles darted  an inch or two apart  deep into my breast.
Carmilla,i waked with a scream.
Carmilla,the room was lighted by the candle that burnt there all through the night  and i saw a female figure standing at the foot of the bed  a little at the right side.
Carmilla,it was in a dark loose dress  and its hair was down and covered its shoulders.
Carmilla,a block of stone could not have been more still.
Carmilla,there was not the slightest stir of respiration.
Carmilla,as i stared at it  the figure appeared to have changed its place  and was now nearer the door  then  close to it  the door opened  and it passed out.
Carmilla,i was now relieved  and able to breathe and move.
Carmilla,my first thought was that carmilla had been playing me a trick  and that i had forgotten to secure my door.
Carmilla,i hastened to it  and found it locked as usual on the inside.
Carmilla,i was afraid to open it   i was horrified.
Carmilla,i sprang into my bed and covered my head up in the bedclothes  and lay there more dead than alive till morning.
Carmilla,it would be vain my attempting to tell you the horror with which  even now  i recall the occurrence of that night.
Carmilla,it was no such transitory terror as a dream leaves behind it.
Carmilla,it seemed to deepen by time  and communicated itself to the room and the very furniture that had encompassed the apparition.
Carmilla,i could not bear next day to be alone for a moment.
Carmilla,i should have told papa  but for two opposite reasons.
Carmilla,at one time i thought he would laugh at my story  and i could not bear its being treated as a jest  and at another i thought he might fancy that i had been attacked by the mysterious complaint which had invaded our neighborhood.
Carmilla,i had myself no misgiving of the kind  and as he had been rather an invalid for some time  i was afraid of alarming him.
Carmilla,i was comfortable enough with my good natured companions  madame perrodon  and the vivacious mademoiselle lafontaine.
Carmilla,they both perceived that i was out of spirits and nervous  and at length i told them what lay so heavy at my heart.
Carmilla,mademoiselle laughed  but i fancied that madame perrodon looked anxious.
Carmilla,by the by    said mademoiselle  laughing     the long lime tree walk  behind carmilla   s bedroom window  is haunted        nonsense    exclaimed madame  who probably thought the theme rather inopportune     and who tells that story  my dear        martin says that he came up twice  when the old yard gate was being repaired  before sunrise  and twice saw the same female figure walking down the lime tree avenue.
Carmilla,so he well might  as long as there are cows to milk in the river fields    said madame.
Carmilla,i daresay  but martin chooses to be frightened  and never did i see fool more frightened.
Carmilla,you must not say a word about it to carmilla  because she can see down that walk from her room window    i interposed     and she is  if possible  a greater coward than i.    carmilla came down rather later than usual that day.
Carmilla,i was so frightened last night    she said  so soon as were together     and i am sure i should have seen something dreadful if it had not been for that charm i bought from the poor little hunchback whom i called such hard names.
Carmilla,i had a dream of something black coming round my bed  and i awoke in a perfect horror  and i really thought  for some seconds  i saw a dark figure near the chimneypiece  but i felt under my pillow for my charm  and the moment my fingers touched it  the figure disappeared  and i felt quite certain  only that i had it by me  that something frightful would have made its appearance  and  perhaps  throttled me  as it did those poor people we heard of.
Carmilla,well  listen to me    i began  and recounted my adventure  at the recital of which she appeared horrified.
Carmilla,and had you the charm near you    she asked  earnestly.
Carmilla,no  i had dropped it into a china vase in the drawing room  but i shall certainly take it with me tonight  as you have so much faith in it.
Carmilla,at this distance of time i cannot tell you  or even understand  how i overcame my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that night.
Carmilla,i remember distinctly that i pinned the charm to my pillow.
Carmilla,i fell asleep almost immediately  and slept even more soundly than usual all night.
Carmilla,next night i passed as well.
Carmilla,my sleep was delightfully deep and dreamless.
Carmilla,but i wakened with a sense of lassitude and melancholy  which  however  did not exceed a degree that was almost luxurious.
Carmilla,well  i told you so    said carmilla  when i described my quiet sleep     i had such delightful sleep myself last night  i pinned the charm to the breast of my nightdress.
Carmilla,it was too far away the night before.
Carmilla,i am quite sure it was all fancy  except the dreams.
Carmilla,i used to think that evil spirits made dreams  but our doctor told me it is no such thing.
Carmilla,only a fever passing by  or some other malady  as they often do  he said  knocks at the door  and not being able to get in  passes on  with that alarm.
Carmilla,and what do you think the charm is    said i.
Carmilla,it has been fumigated or immersed in some drug  and is an antidote against the malaria    she answered.
Carmilla,then it acts only on the body        certainly  you don   t suppose that evil spirits are frightened by bits of ribbon  or the perfumes of a druggist   s shop  no  these complaints  wandering in the air  begin by trying the nerves  and so infect the brain  but before they can seize upon you  the antidote repels them.
Carmilla,that i am sure is what the charm has done for us.
Carmilla,it is nothing magical  it is simply natural.
Carmilla,i should have been happier if i could have quite agreed with carmilla  but i did my best  and the impression was a little losing its force.
Carmilla,for some nights i slept profoundly  but still every morning i felt the same lassitude  and a languor weighed upon me all day.
Carmilla,i felt myself a changed girl.
Carmilla,a strange melancholy was stealing over me  a melancholy that i would not have interrupted.
Carmilla,dim thoughts of death began to open  and an idea that i was slowly sinking took gentle  and  somehow  not unwelcome  possession of me.
Carmilla,if it was sad  the tone of mind which this induced was also sweet.
Carmilla,whatever it might be  my soul acquiesced in it.
Carmilla,i would not admit that i was ill  i would not consent to tell my papa  or to have the doctor sent for.
Carmilla,carmilla became more devoted to me than ever  and her strange paroxysms of languid adoration more frequent.
Carmilla,she used to gloat on me with increasing ardor the more my strength and spirits waned.
Carmilla,this always shocked me like a momentary glare of insanity.
Carmilla,without knowing it  i was now in a pretty advanced stage of the strangest illness under which mortal ever suffered.
Carmilla,there was an unaccountable fascination in its earlier symptoms that more than reconciled me to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady.
Carmilla,this fascination increased for a time  until it reached a certain point  when gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it  deepening  as you shall hear  until it discolored and perverted the whole state of my life.
Carmilla,the first change i experienced was rather agreeable.
Carmilla,it was very near the turning point from which began the descent of avernus.
Carmilla,certain vague and strange sensations visited me in my sleep.
Carmilla,the prevailing one was of that pleasant  peculiar cold thrill which we feel in bathing  when we move against the current of a river.
Carmilla,this was soon accompanied by dreams that seemed interminable  and were so vague that i could never recollect their scenery and persons  or any one connected portion of their action.
Carmilla,but they left an awful impression  and a sense of exhaustion  as if i had passed through a long period of great mental exertion and danger.
Carmilla,after all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of having been in a place very nearly dark  and of having spoken to people whom i could not see  and especially of one clear voice  of a female   s  very deep  that spoke as if at a distance  slowly  and producing always the same sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear.
Carmilla,sometimes there came a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck.
Carmilla,sometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me  and longer and longer and more lovingly as they reached my throat  but there the caress fixed itself.
Carmilla,my heart beat faster  my breathing rose and fell rapidly and full drawn  a sobbing  that rose into a sense of strangulation  supervened  and turned into a dreadful convulsion  in which my senses left me and i became unconscious.
Carmilla,it was now three weeks since the commencement of this unaccountable state.
Carmilla,my sufferings had  during the last week  told upon my appearance.
Carmilla,i had grown pale  my eyes were dilated and darkened underneath  and the languor which i had long felt began to display itself in my countenance.
Carmilla,my father asked me often whether i was ill  but  with an obstinacy which now seems to me unaccountable  i persisted in assuring him that i was quite well.
Carmilla,in a sense this was true.
Carmilla,i had no pain  i could complain of no bodily derangement.
Carmilla,my complaint seemed to be one of the imagination  or the nerves  and  horrible as my sufferings were  i kept them  with a morbid reserve  very nearly to myself.
Carmilla,it could not be that terrible complaint which the peasants called the oupire  for i had now been suffering for three weeks  and they were seldom ill for much more than three days  when death put an end to their miseries.
Carmilla,carmilla complained of dreams and feverish sensations  but by no means of so alarming a kind as mine.
Carmilla,i say that mine were extremely alarming.
Carmilla,had i been capable of comprehending my condition  i would have invoked aid and advice on my knees.
Carmilla,the narcotic of an unsuspected influence was acting upon me  and my perceptions were benumbed.
Carmilla,i am going to tell you now of a dream that led immediately to an odd discovery.
Carmilla,one night  instead of the voice i was accustomed to hear in the dark  i heard one  sweet and tender  and at the same time terrible  which said      your mother warns you to beware of the assassin.
Carmilla,at the same time a light unexpectedly sprang up  and i saw carmilla  standing  near the foot of my bed  in her white nightdress  bathed  from her chin to her feet  in one great stain of blood.
Carmilla,i wakened with a shriek  possessed with the one idea that carmilla was being murdered.
Carmilla,i remember springing from my bed  and my next recollection is that of standing on the lobby  crying for help.
Carmilla,madame and mademoiselle came scurrying out of their rooms in alarm  a lamp burned always on the lobby  and seeing me  they soon learned the cause of my terror.
Carmilla,i insisted on our knocking at carmilla   s door.
Carmilla,our knocking was unanswered.
Carmilla,it soon became a pounding and an uproar.
Carmilla,we shrieked her name  but all was vain.
Carmilla,we all grew frightened  for the door was locked.
Carmilla,we hurried back  in panic  to my room.
Carmilla,there we rang the bell long and furiously.
Carmilla,if my father   s room had been at that side of the house  we would have called him up at once to our aid.
Carmilla,but  alas  he was quite out of hearing  and to reach him involved an excursion for which we none of us had courage.
Carmilla,servants  however  soon came running up the stairs  i had got on my dressing gown and slippers meanwhile  and my companions were already similarly furnished.
Carmilla,recognizing the voices of the servants on the lobby  we sallied out together  and having renewed  as fruitlessly  our summons at carmilla   s door  i ordered the men to force the lock.
Carmilla,they did so  and we stood  holding our lights aloft  in the doorway  and so stared into the room.
Carmilla,we called her by name  but there was still no reply.
Carmilla,we looked round the room.
Carmilla,everything was undisturbed.
Carmilla,it was exactly in the state in which i had left it on bidding her good night.
Carmilla,but carmilla was gone.
Carmilla,at sight of the room  perfectly undisturbed except for our violent entrance  we began to cool a little  and soon recovered our senses sufficiently to dismiss the men.
Carmilla,it had struck mademoiselle that possibly carmilla had been wakened by the uproar at her door  and in her first panic had jumped from her bed  and hid herself in a press  or behind a curtain  from which she could not  of course  emerge until the majordomo and his myrmidons had withdrawn.
Carmilla,we now recommenced our search  and began to call her name again.
Carmilla,it was all to no purpose.
Carmilla,our perplexity and agitation increased.
Carmilla,we examined the windows  but they were secured.
Carmilla,i implored of carmilla  if she had concealed herself  to play this cruel trick no longer   to come out and to end our anxieties.
Carmilla,it was all useless.
Carmilla,i was by this time convinced that she was not in the room  nor in the dressing room  the door of which was still locked on this side.
Carmilla,she could not have passed it.
Carmilla,i was utterly puzzled.
Carmilla,had carmilla discovered one of those secret passages which the old housekeeper said were known to exist in the schloss  although the tradition of their exact situation had been lost  a little time would  no doubt  explain all   utterly perplexed as  for the present  we were.
Carmilla,it was past four o   clock  and i preferred passing the remaining hours of darkness in madame   s room.
Carmilla,daylight brought no solution of the difficulty.
Carmilla,the whole household  with my father at its head  was in a state of agitation next morning.
Carmilla,every part of the chateau was searched.
Carmilla,the grounds were explored.
Carmilla,no trace of the missing lady could be discovered.
Carmilla,the stream was about to be dragged  my father was in distraction  what a tale to have to tell the poor girl   s mother on her return.
Carmilla,i  too  was almost beside myself  though my grief was quite of a different kind.
Carmilla,the morning was passed in alarm and excitement.
Carmilla,it was now one o   clock  and still no tidings.
Carmilla,i ran up to carmilla   s room  and found her standing at her dressing table.
Carmilla,i was astounded.
Carmilla,i could not believe my eyes.
Carmilla,she beckoned me to her with her pretty finger  in silence.
Carmilla,her face expressed extreme fear.
Carmilla,i ran to her in an ecstasy of joy  i kissed and embraced her again and again.
Carmilla,i ran to the bell and rang it vehemently  to bring others to the spot who might at once relieve my father   s anxiety.
Carmilla,dear carmilla  what has become of you all this time  we have been in agonies of anxiety about you    i exclaimed.
Carmilla,where have you been  how did you come back        last night has been a night of wonders    she said.
Carmilla,for mercy   s sake  explain all you can.
Carmilla,it was past two last night    she said     when i went to sleep as usual in my bed  with my doors locked  that of the dressing room  and that opening upon the gallery.
Carmilla,my sleep was uninterrupted  and  so far as i know  dreamless  but i woke just now on the sofa in the dressing room there  and i found the door between the rooms open  and the other door forced.
Carmilla,how could all this have happened without my being wakened  it must have been accompanied with a great deal of noise  and i am particularly easily wakened  and how could i have been carried out of my bed without my sleep having been interrupted  i whom the slightest stir startles     by this time  madame  mademoiselle  my father  and a number of the servants were in the room.
Carmilla,carmilla was  of course  overwhelmed with inquiries  congratulations  and welcomes.
Carmilla,she had but one story to tell  and seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of accounting for what had happened.
Carmilla,my father took a turn up and down the room  thinking.
Carmilla,i saw carmilla   s eye follow him for a moment with a sly  dark glance.
Carmilla,when my father had sent the servants away  mademoiselle having gone in search of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile  and there being no one now in the room with carmilla  except my father  madame  and myself  he came to her thoughtfully  took her hand very kindly  led her to the sofa  and sat down beside her.
Carmilla,will you forgive me  my dear  if i risk a conjecture  and ask a question        who can have a better right    she said.
Carmilla,ask what you please  and i will tell you everything.
Carmilla,but my story is simply one of bewilderment and darkness.
Carmilla,i know absolutely nothing.
Carmilla,put any question you please  but you know  of course  the limitations mamma has placed me under.
Carmilla,perfectly  my dear child.
Carmilla,i need not approach the topics on which she desires our silence.
Carmilla,now  the marvel of last night consists in your having been removed from your bed and your room  without being wakened  and this removal having occurred apparently while the windows were still secured  and the two doors locked upon the inside.
Carmilla,i will tell you my theory and ask you a question.
Carmilla,carmilla was leaning on her hand dejectedly  madame and i were listening breathlessly.
Carmilla,now  my question is this.
Carmilla,have you ever been suspected of walking in your sleep        never  since i was very young indeed.
Carmilla,but you did walk in your sleep when you were young        yes  i know i did.
Carmilla,i have been told so often by my old nurse.
Carmilla,my father smiled and nodded.
Carmilla,well  what has happened is this.
Carmilla,you got up in your sleep  unlocked the door  not leaving the key  as usual  in the lock  but taking it out and locking it on the outside  you again took the key out  and carried it away with you to some one of the five and twenty rooms on this floor  or perhaps upstairs or downstairs.
Carmilla,there are so many rooms and closets  so much heavy furniture  and such accumulations of lumber  that it would require a week to search this old house thoroughly.
Carmilla,do you see  now  what i mean        i do  but not all    she answered.
Carmilla,and how  papa  do you account for her finding herself on the sofa in the dressing room  which we had searched so carefully        she came there after you had searched it  still in her sleep  and at last awoke spontaneously  and was as much surprised to find herself where she was as any one else.
Carmilla,i wish all mysteries were as easily and innocently explained as yours  carmilla    he said  laughing.
Carmilla,and so we may congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural explanation of the occurrence is one that involves no drugging  no tampering with locks  no burglars  or poisoners  or witches   nothing that need alarm carmilla  or anyone else  for our safety.
Carmilla,carmilla was looking charmingly.
Carmilla,nothing could be more beautiful than her tints.
Carmilla,her beauty was  i think  enhanced by that graceful languor that was peculiar to her.
Carmilla,i think my father was silently contrasting her looks with mine  for he said      i wish my poor laura was looking more like herself    and he sighed.
Carmilla,so our alarms were happily ended  and carmilla restored to her friends.
Carmilla,as carmilla would not hear of an attendant sleeping in her room  my father arranged that a servant should sleep outside her door  so that she would not attempt to make another such excursion without being arrested at her own door.
Carmilla,that night passed quietly  and next morning early  the doctor  whom my father had sent for without telling me a word about it  arrived to see me.
Carmilla,madame accompanied me to the library  and there the grave little doctor  with white hair and spectacles  whom i mentioned before  was waiting to receive me.
Carmilla,i told him my story  and as i proceeded he grew graver and graver.
Carmilla,we were standing  he and i  in the recess of one of the windows  facing one another.
Carmilla,when my statement was over  he leaned with his shoulders against the wall  and with his eyes fixed on me earnestly  with an interest in which was a dash of horror.
Carmilla,after a minute   s reflection  he asked madame if he could see my father.
Carmilla,he was sent for accordingly  and as he entered  smiling  he said      i dare say  doctor  you are going to tell me that i am an old fool for having brought you here  i hope i am.
Carmilla,but his smile faded into shadow as the doctor  with a very grave face  beckoned him to him.
Carmilla,he and the doctor talked for some time in the same recess where i had just conferred with the physician.
Carmilla,it seemed an earnest and argumentative conversation.
Carmilla,the room is very large  and i and madame stood together  burning with curiosity  at the farther end.
Carmilla,not a word could we hear  however  for they spoke in a very low tone  and the deep recess of the window quite concealed the doctor from view  and very nearly my father  whose foot  arm  and shoulder only could we see  and the voices were  i suppose  all the less audible for the sort of closet which the thick wall and window formed.
Carmilla,after a time my father   s face looked into the room  it was pale  thoughtful  and  i fancied  agitated.
Carmilla,laura  dear  come here for a moment.
Carmilla,madame  we shan   t trouble you  the doctor says  at present.
Carmilla,accordingly i approached  for the first time a little alarmed  for  although i felt very weak  i did not feel ill  and strength  one always fancies  is a thing that may be picked up when we please.
Carmilla,my father held out his hand to me  as i drew near  but he was looking at the doctor  and he said      it certainly is very odd  i don   t understand it quite.
Carmilla,laura  come here  dear  now attend to doctor spielsberg  and recollect yourself.
Carmilla,you mentioned a sensation like that of two needles piercing the skin  somewhere about your neck  on the night when you experienced your first horrible dream.
Carmilla,is there still any soreness        none at all    i answered.
Carmilla,can you indicate with your finger about the point at which you think this occurred        very little below my throat   here    i answered.
Carmilla,i wore a morning dress  which covered the place i pointed to.
Carmilla,now you can satisfy yourself    said the doctor.
Carmilla,you won   t mind your papa   s lowering your dress a very little.
Carmilla,it is necessary  to detect a symptom of the complaint under which you have been suffering.
Carmilla,i acquiesced.
Carmilla,it was only an inch or two below the edge of my collar.
Carmilla,god bless me    so it is    exclaimed my father  growing pale.
Carmilla,you see it now with your own eyes    said the doctor  with a gloomy triumph.
Carmilla,what is it    i exclaimed  beginning to be frightened.
Carmilla,nothing  my dear young lady  but a small blue spot  about the size of the tip of your little finger  and now    he continued  turning to papa     the question is what is best to be done     is there any danger   i urged  in great trepidation.
Carmilla,i trust not  my dear    answered the doctor.
Carmilla,i don   t see why you should not recover.
Carmilla,i don   t see why you should not begin immediately to get better.
Carmilla,that is the point at which the sense of strangulation begins        yes    i answered.
Carmilla,and   recollect as well as you can   the same point was a kind of center of that thrill which you described just now  like the current of a cold stream running against you        it may have been  i think it was.
Carmilla,ay  you see    he added  turning to my father.
Carmilla,shall i say a word to madame        certainly    said my father.
Carmilla,he called madame to him  and said      i find my young friend here far from well.
Carmilla,it won   t be of any great consequence  i hope  but it will be necessary that some steps be taken  which i will explain by and by  but in the meantime  madame  you will be so good as not to let miss laura be alone for one moment.
Carmilla,that is the only direction i need give for the present.
Carmilla,it is indispensable.
Carmilla,we may rely upon your kindness  madame  i know    added my father.
Carmilla,madame satisfied him eagerly.
Carmilla,and you  dear laura  i know you will observe the doctor   s direction.
Carmilla,i shall have to ask your opinion upon another patient  whose symptoms slightly resemble those of my daughter  that have just been detailed to you   very much milder in degree  but i believe quite of the same sort.
Carmilla,she is a young lady   our guest  but as you say you will be passing this way again this evening  you can   t do better than take your supper here  and you can then see her.
Carmilla,she does not come down till the afternoon.
Carmilla,i thank you    said the doctor.
Carmilla,i shall be with you  then  at about seven this evening.
Carmilla,and then they repeated their directions to me and to madame  and with this parting charge my father left us  and walked out with the doctor  and i saw them pacing together up and down between the road and the moat  on the grassy platform in front of the castle  evidently absorbed in earnest conversation.
Carmilla,the doctor did not return.
Carmilla,i saw him mount his horse there  take his leave  and ride away eastward through the forest.
Carmilla,nearly at the same time i saw the man arrive from dranfield with the letters  and dismount and hand the bag to my father.
Carmilla,in the meantime  madame and i were both busy  lost in conjecture as to the reasons of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor and my father had concurred in imposing.
Carmilla,madame  as she afterwards told me  was afraid the doctor apprehended a sudden seizure  and that  without prompt assistance  i might either lose my life in a fit  or at least be seriously hurt.
Carmilla,the interpretation did not strike me  and i fancied  perhaps luckily for my nerves  that the arrangement was prescribed simply to secure a companion  who would prevent my taking too much exercise  or eating unripe fruit  or doing any of the fifty foolish things to which young people are supposed to be prone.
Carmilla,about half an hour after my father came in   he had a letter in his hand   and said      this letter had been delayed  it is from general spielsdorf.
Carmilla,he might have been here yesterday  he may not come till tomorrow or he may be here today.
Carmilla,he put the open letter into my hand  but he did not look pleased  as he used when a guest  especially one so much loved as the general  was coming.
Carmilla,on the contrary  he looked as if he wished him at the bottom of the red sea.
Carmilla,there was plainly something on his mind which he did not choose to divulge.
Carmilla,papa  darling  will you tell me this    said i  suddenly laying my hand on his arm  and looking  i am sure  imploringly in his face.
Carmilla,perhaps    he answered  smoothing my hair caressingly over my eyes.
Carmilla,does the doctor think me very ill        no  dear  he thinks  if right steps are taken  you will be quite well again  at least  on the high road to a complete recovery  in a day or two    he answered  a little dryly.
Carmilla,i wish our good friend  the general  had chosen any other time  that is  i wish you had been perfectly well to receive him.
Carmilla,but do tell me  papa    i insisted     what does he think is the matter with me        nothing  you must not plague me with questions    he answered  with more irritation than i ever remember him to have displayed before  and seeing that i looked wounded  i suppose  he kissed me  and added     you shall know all about it in a day or two  that is  all that i know.
Carmilla,in the meantime you are not to trouble your head about it.
Carmilla,he turned and left the room  but came back before i had done wondering and puzzling over the oddity of all this  it was merely to say that he was going to karnstein  and had ordered the carriage to be ready at twelve  and that i and madame should accompany him  he was going to see the priest who lived near those picturesque grounds  upon business  and as carmilla had never seen them  she could follow  when she came down  with mademoiselle  who would bring materials for what you call a picnic  which might be laid for us in the ruined castle.
Carmilla,at twelve o   clock  accordingly  i was ready  and not long after  my father  madame and i set out upon our projected drive.
Carmilla,passing the drawbridge we turn to the right  and follow the road over the steep gothic bridge  westward  to reach the deserted village and ruined castle of karnstein.
Carmilla,no sylvan drive can be fancied prettier.
Carmilla,the ground breaks into gentle hills and hollows  all clothed with beautiful wood  totally destitute of the comparative formality which artificial planting and early culture and pruning impart.
Carmilla,the irregularities of the ground often lead the road out of its course  and cause it to wind beautifully round the sides of broken hollows and the steeper sides of the hills  among varieties of ground almost inexhaustible.
Carmilla,turning one of these points  we suddenly encountered our old friend  the general  riding towards us  attended by a mounted servant.
Carmilla,his portmanteaus were following in a hired wagon  such as we term a cart.
Carmilla,the general dismounted as we pulled up  and  after the usual greetings  was easily persuaded to accept the vacant seat in the carriage and send his horse on with his servant to the schloss.
Carmilla,it was about ten months since we had last seen him  but that time had sufficed to make an alteration of years in his appearance.
Carmilla,he had grown thinner  something of gloom and anxiety had taken the place of that cordial serenity which used to characterize his features.
Carmilla,his dark blue eyes  always penetrating  now gleamed with a sterner light from under his shaggy grey eyebrows.
Carmilla,it was not such a change as grief alone usually induces  and angrier passions seemed to have had their share in bringing it about.
Carmilla,we had not long resumed our drive  when the general began to talk  with his usual soldierly directness  of the bereavement  as he termed it  which he had sustained in the death of his beloved niece and ward  and he then broke out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury  inveighing against the    hellish arts   to which she had fallen a victim  and expressing  with more exasperation than piety  his wonder that heaven should tolerate so monstrous an indulgence of the lusts and malignity of hell.
Carmilla,my father  who saw at once that something very extraordinary had befallen  asked him  if not too painful to him  to detail the circumstances which he thought justified the strong terms in which he expressed himself.
Carmilla,i should tell you all with pleasure    said the general     but you would not believe me.
Carmilla,why should i not    he asked.
Carmilla,because    he answered testily     you believe in nothing but what consists with your own prejudices and illusions.
Carmilla,i remember when i was like you  but i have learned better.
Carmilla,try me    said my father     i am not such a dogmatist as you suppose.
Carmilla,besides which  i very well know that you generally require proof for what you believe  and am  therefore  very strongly predisposed to respect your conclusions.
Carmilla,you are right in supposing that i have not been led lightly into a belief in the marvelous   for what i have experienced is marvelous   and i have been forced by extraordinary evidence to credit that which ran counter  diametrically  to all my theories.
Carmilla,i have been made the dupe of a preternatural conspiracy.
Carmilla,notwithstanding his professions of confidence in the general   s penetration  i saw my father  at this point  glance at the general  with  as i thought  a marked suspicion of his sanity.
Carmilla,the general did not see it  luckily.
Carmilla,he was looking gloomily and curiously into the glades and vistas of the woods that were opening before us.
Carmilla,you are going to the ruins of karnstein    he said.
Carmilla,yes  it is a lucky coincidence  do you know i was going to ask you to bring me there to inspect them.
Carmilla,i have a special object in exploring.
Carmilla,there is a ruined chapel  ain   t there  with a great many tombs of that extinct family        so there are   highly interesting    said my father.
Carmilla,i hope you are thinking of claiming the title and estates     my father said this gaily  but the general did not recollect the laugh  or even the smile  which courtesy exacts for a friend   s joke  on the contrary  he looked grave and even fierce  ruminating on a matter that stirred his anger and horror.
Carmilla,something very different    he said  gruffly.
Carmilla,i mean to unearth some of those fine people.
Carmilla,i hope  by god   s blessing  to accomplish a pious sacrilege here  which will relieve our earth of certain monsters  and enable honest people to sleep in their beds without being assailed by murderers.
Carmilla,i have strange things to tell you  my dear friend  such as i myself would have scouted as incredible a few months since.
Carmilla,my father looked at him again  but this time not with a glance of suspicion   with an eye  rather  of keen intelligence and alarm.
Carmilla,the house of karnstein    he said     has been long extinct  a hundred years at least.
Carmilla,my dear wife was maternally descended from the karnsteins.
Carmilla,but the name and title have long ceased to exist.
Carmilla,the castle is a ruin  the very village is deserted  it is fifty years since the smoke of a chimney was seen there  not a roof left.
Carmilla,quite true.
Carmilla,i have heard a great deal about that since i last saw you  a great deal that will astonish you.
Carmilla,but i had better relate everything in the order in which it occurred    said the general.
Carmilla,you saw my dear ward   my child  i may call her.
Carmilla,no creature could have been more beautiful  and only three months ago none more blooming.
Carmilla,yes  poor thing  when i saw her last she certainly was quite lovely    said my father.
Carmilla,i was grieved and shocked more than i can tell you  my dear friend  i knew what a blow it was to you.
Carmilla,he took the general   s hand  and they exchanged a kind pressure.
Carmilla,tears gathered in the old soldier   s eyes.
Carmilla,he did not seek to conceal them.
Carmilla,he said      we have been very old friends  i knew you would feel for me  childless as i am.
Carmilla,she had become an object of very near interest to me  and repaid my care by an affection that cheered my home and made my life happy.
Carmilla,that is all gone.
Carmilla,the years that remain to me on earth may not be very long  but by god   s mercy i hope to accomplish a service to mankind before i die  and to subserve the vengeance of heaven upon the fiends who have murdered my poor child in the spring of her hopes and beauty        you said  just now  that you intended relating everything as it occurred    said my father.
Carmilla,pray do  i assure you that it is not mere curiosity that prompts me.
Carmilla,by this time we had reached the point at which the drunstall road  by which the general had come  diverges from the road which we were traveling to karnstein.
Carmilla,how far is it to the ruins    inquired the general  looking anxiously forward.
Carmilla,about half a league    answered my father.
Carmilla,pray let us hear the story you were so good as to promise.
Carmilla,with all my heart    said the general  with an effort  and after a short pause in which to arrange his subject  he commenced one of the strangest narratives i ever heard.
Carmilla,my dear child was looking forward with great pleasure to the visit you had been so good as to arrange for her to your charming daughter.
Carmilla,here he made me a gallant but melancholy bow.
Carmilla,in the meantime we had an invitation to my old friend the count carlsfeld  whose schloss is about six leagues to the other side of karnstein.
Carmilla,it was to attend the series of fetes which  you remember  were given by him in honor of his illustrious visitor  the grand duke charles.
Carmilla,yes  and very splendid  i believe  they were    said my father.
Carmilla,princely  but then his hospitalities are quite regal.
Carmilla,he has aladdin   s lamp.
Carmilla,the night from which my sorrow dates was devoted to a magnificent masquerade.
Carmilla,the grounds were thrown open  the trees hung with colored lamps.
Carmilla,there was such a display of fireworks as paris itself had never witnessed.
Carmilla,and such music   music  you know  is my weakness   such ravishing music  the finest instrumental band  perhaps  in the world  and the finest singers who could be collected from all the great operas in europe.
Carmilla,as you wandered through these fantastically illuminated grounds  the moon lighted chateau throwing a rosy light from its long rows of windows  you would suddenly hear these ravishing voices stealing from the silence of some grove  or rising from boats upon the lake.
Carmilla,i felt myself  as i looked and listened  carried back into the romance and poetry of my early youth.
Carmilla,when the fireworks were ended  and the ball beginning  we returned to the noble suite of rooms that were thrown open to the dancers.
Carmilla,a masked ball  you know  is a beautiful sight  but so brilliant a spectacle of the kind i never saw before.
Carmilla,it was a very aristocratic assembly.
Carmilla,i was myself almost the only    nobody    present.
Carmilla,my dear child was looking quite beautiful.
Carmilla,she wore no mask.
Carmilla,her excitement and delight added an unspeakable charm to her features  always lovely.
Carmilla,i remarked a young lady  dressed magnificently  but wearing a mask  who appeared to me to be observing my ward with extraordinary interest.
Carmilla,i had seen her  earlier in the evening  in the great hall  and again  for a few minutes  walking near us  on the terrace under the castle windows  similarly employed.
Carmilla,a lady  also masked  richly and gravely dressed  and with a stately air  like a person of rank  accompanied her as a chaperon.
Carmilla,had the young lady not worn a mask  i could  of course  have been much more certain upon the question whether she was really watching my poor darling.
Carmilla,i am now well assured that she was.
Carmilla,we were now in one of the salons.
Carmilla,my poor dear child had been dancing  and was resting a little in one of the chairs near the door  i was standing near.
Carmilla,the two ladies i have mentioned had approached and the younger took the chair next my ward  while her companion stood beside me  and for a little time addressed herself  in a low tone  to her charge.
Carmilla,availing herself of the privilege of her mask  she turned to me  and in the tone of an old friend  and calling me by my name  opened a conversation with me  which piqued my curiosity a good deal.
Carmilla,she referred to many scenes where she had met me   at court  and at distinguished houses.
Carmilla,she alluded to little incidents which i had long ceased to think of  but which  i found  had only lain in abeyance in my memory  for they instantly started into life at her touch.
Carmilla,i became more and more curious to ascertain who she was  every moment.
Carmilla,she parried my attempts to discover very adroitly and pleasantly.
Carmilla,the knowledge she showed of many passages in my life seemed to me all but unaccountable  and she appeared to take a not unnatural pleasure in foiling my curiosity  and in seeing me flounder in my eager perplexity  from one conjecture to another.
Carmilla,in the meantime the young lady  whom her mother called by the odd name of millarca  when she once or twice addressed her  had  with the same ease and grace  got into conversation with my ward.
Carmilla,she introduced herself by saying that her mother was a very old acquaintance of mine.
Carmilla,she spoke of the agreeable audacity which a mask rendered practicable  she talked like a friend  she admired her dress  and insinuated very prettily her admiration of her beauty.
Carmilla,she amused her with laughing criticisms upon the people who crowded the ballroom  and laughed at my poor child   s fun.
Carmilla,she was very witty and lively when she pleased  and after a time they had grown very good friends  and the young stranger lowered her mask  displaying a remarkably beautiful face.
Carmilla,i had never seen it before  neither had my dear child.
Carmilla,but though it was new to us  the features were so engaging  as well as lovely  that it was impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully.
Carmilla,my poor girl did so.
Carmilla,i never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight  unless  indeed  it was the stranger herself  who seemed quite to have lost her heart to her.
Carmilla,in the meantime  availing myself of the license of a masquerade  i put not a few questions to the elder lady.
Carmilla,you have puzzled me utterly     i said  laughing.
Carmilla,is that not enough   won   t you  now  consent to stand on equal terms  and do me the kindness to remove your mask            can any request be more unreasonable     she replied.
Carmilla,ask a lady to yield an advantage  beside  how do you know you should recognize me  years make changes.
Carmilla,as you see     i said  with a bow  and  i suppose  a rather melancholy little laugh.
Carmilla,as philosophers tell us     she said     and how do you know that a sight of my face would help you            i should take chance for that     i answered.
Carmilla,it is vain trying to make yourself out an old woman  your figure betrays you.
Carmilla,years  nevertheless  have passed since i saw you  rather since you saw me  for that is what i am considering.
Carmilla,millarca  there  is my daughter  i cannot then be young  even in the opinion of people whom time has taught to be indulgent  and i may not like to be compared with what you remember me.
Carmilla,you have no mask to remove.
Carmilla,you can offer me nothing in exchange.
Carmilla,my petition is to your pity  to remove it.
Carmilla,and mine to yours  to let it stay where it is     she replied.
Carmilla,well  then  at least you will tell me whether you are french or german  you speak both languages so perfectly.
Carmilla,i don   t think i shall tell you that  general  you intend a surprise  and are meditating the particular point of attack.
Carmilla,at all events  you won   t deny this     i said     that being honored by your permission to converse  i ought to know how to address you.
Carmilla,shall i say madame la comtesse         she laughed  and she would  no doubt  have met me with another evasion   if  indeed  i can treat any occurrence in an interview every circumstance of which was prearranged  as i now believe  with the profoundest cunning  as liable to be modified by accident.
Carmilla,as to that     she began  but she was interrupted  almost as she opened her lips  by a gentleman  dressed in black  who looked particularly elegant and distinguished  with this drawback  that his face was the most deadly pale i ever saw  except in death.
Carmilla,he was in no masquerade   in the plain evening dress of a gentleman  and he said  without a smile  but with a courtly and unusually low bow            will madame la comtesse permit me to say a very few words which may interest her         the lady turned quickly to him  and touched her lip in token of silence  she then said to me     keep my place for me  general  i shall return when i have said a few words.
Carmilla,and with this injunction  playfully given  she walked a little aside with the gentleman in black  and talked for some minutes  apparently very earnestly.
Carmilla,they then walked away slowly together in the crowd  and i lost them for some minutes.
Carmilla,i spent the interval in cudgeling my brains for a conjecture as to the identity of the lady who seemed to remember me so kindly  and i was thinking of turning about and joining in the conversation between my pretty ward and the countess   s daughter  and trying whether  by the time she returned  i might not have a surprise in store for her  by having her name  title  chateau  and estates at my fingers    ends.
Carmilla,but at this moment she returned  accompanied by the pale man in black  who said         i shall return and inform madame la comtesse when her carriage is at the door.
Carmilla,he withdrew with a bow.
Carmilla,then we are to lose madame la comtesse  but i hope only for a few hours     i said  with a low bow.
Carmilla,it may be that only  or it may be a few weeks.
Carmilla,it was very unlucky his speaking to me just now as he did.
Carmilla,do you now know me         i assured her i did not.
Carmilla,you shall know me     she said     but not at present.
Carmilla,we are older and better friends than  perhaps  you suspect.
Carmilla,i cannot yet declare myself.
Carmilla,i shall in three weeks pass your beautiful schloss  about which i have been making enquiries.
Carmilla,i shall then look in upon you for an hour or two  and renew a friendship which i never think of without a thousand pleasant recollections.
Carmilla,this moment a piece of news has reached me like a thunderbolt.
Carmilla,i must set out now  and travel by a devious route  nearly a hundred miles  with all the dispatch i can possibly make.
Carmilla,my perplexities multiply.
Carmilla,i am only deterred by the compulsory reserve i practice as to my name from making a very singular request of you.
Carmilla,my poor child has not quite recovered her strength.
Carmilla,her horse fell with her  at a hunt which she had ridden out to witness  her nerves have not yet recovered the shock  and our physician says that she must on no account exert herself for some time to come.
Carmilla,we came here  in consequence  by very easy stages   hardly six leagues a day.
Carmilla,i must now travel day and night  on a mission of life and death   a mission the critical and momentous nature of which i shall be able to explain to you when we meet  as i hope we shall  in a few weeks  without the necessity of any concealment.
Carmilla,she went on to make her petition  and it was in the tone of a person from whom such a request amounted to conferring  rather than seeking a favor.
Carmilla,this was only in manner  and  as it seemed  quite unconsciously.
Carmilla,than the terms in which it was expressed  nothing could be more deprecatory.
Carmilla,it was simply that i would consent to take charge of her daughter during her absence.
Carmilla,this was  all things considered  a strange  not to say  an audacious request.
Carmilla,she in some sort disarmed me  by stating and admitting everything that could be urged against it  and throwing herself entirely upon my chivalry.
Carmilla,at the same moment  by a fatality that seems to have predetermined all that happened  my poor child came to my side  and  in an undertone  besought me to invite her new friend  millarca  to pay us a visit.
Carmilla,she had just been sounding her  and thought  if her mamma would allow her  she would like it extremely.
Carmilla,at another time i should have told her to wait a little  until  at least  we knew who they were.
Carmilla,but i had not a moment to think in.
Carmilla,the two ladies assailed me together  and i must confess the refined and beautiful face of the young lady  about which there was something extremely engaging  as well as the elegance and fire of high birth  determined me  and  quite overpowered  i submitted  and undertook  too easily  the care of the young lady  whom her mother called millarca.
Carmilla,the countess beckoned to her daughter  who listened with grave attention while she told her  in general terms  how suddenly and peremptorily she had been summoned  and also of the arrangement she had made for her under my care  adding that i was one of her earliest and most valued friends.
Carmilla,i made  of course  such speeches as the case seemed to call for  and found myself  on reflection  in a position which i did not half like.
Carmilla,the gentleman in black returned  and very ceremoniously conducted the lady from the room.
Carmilla,the demeanor of this gentleman was such as to impress me with the conviction that the countess was a lady of very much more importance than her modest title alone might have led me to assume.
Carmilla,her last charge to me was that no attempt was to be made to learn more about her than i might have already guessed  until her return.
Carmilla,our distinguished host  whose guest she was  knew her reasons.
Carmilla,but here     she said     neither i nor my daughter could safely remain for more than a day.
Carmilla,i removed my mask imprudently for a moment  about an hour ago  and  too late  i fancied you saw me.
Carmilla,so i resolved to seek an opportunity of talking a little to you.
Carmilla,had i found that you had seen me  i would have thrown myself on your high sense of honor to keep my secret some weeks.
Carmilla,as it is  i am satisfied that you did not see me  but if you now suspect  or  on reflection  should suspect  who i am  i commit myself  in like manner  entirely to your honor.
Carmilla,my daughter will observe the same secrecy  and i well know that you will  from time to time  remind her  lest she should thoughtlessly disclose it.
Carmilla,she whispered a few words to her daughter  kissed her hurriedly twice  and went away  accompanied by the pale gentleman in black  and disappeared in the crowd.
Carmilla,in the next room     said millarca     there is a window that looks upon the hall door.
Carmilla,i should like to see the last of mamma  and to kiss my hand to her.
Carmilla,we assented  of course  and accompanied her to the window.
Carmilla,we looked out  and saw a handsome old fashioned carriage  with a troop of couriers and footmen.
Carmilla,we saw the slim figure of the pale gentleman in black  as he held a thick velvet cloak  and placed it about her shoulders and threw the hood over her head.
Carmilla,she nodded to him  and just touched his hand with hers.
Carmilla,he bowed low repeatedly as the door closed  and the carriage began to move.
Carmilla,she is gone     said millarca  with a sigh.
Carmilla,she is gone     i repeated to myself  for the first time   in the hurried moments that had elapsed since my consent   reflecting upon the folly of my act.
Carmilla,she did not look up     said the young lady  plaintively.
Carmilla,the countess had taken off her mask  perhaps  and did not care to show her face     i said     and she could not know that you were in the window.
Carmilla,she sighed  and looked in my face.
Carmilla,she was so beautiful that i relented.
Carmilla,i was sorry i had for a moment repented of my hospitality  and i determined to make her amends for the unavowed churlishness of my reception.
Carmilla,the young lady  replacing her mask  joined my ward in persuading me to return to the grounds  where the concert was soon to be renewed.
Carmilla,we did so  and walked up and down the terrace that lies under the castle windows.
Carmilla,millarca became very intimate with us  and amused us with lively descriptions and stories of most of the great people whom we saw upon the terrace.
Carmilla,i liked her more and more every minute.
Carmilla,her gossip without being ill natured  was extremely diverting to me  who had been so long out of the great world.
Carmilla,i thought what life she would give to our sometimes lonely evenings at home.
Carmilla,this ball was not over until the morning sun had almost reached the horizon.
Carmilla,it pleased the grand duke to dance till then  so loyal people could not go away  or think of bed.
Carmilla,we had just got through a crowded saloon  when my ward asked me what had become of millarca.
Carmilla,i thought she had been by her side  and she fancied she was by mine.
Carmilla,the fact was  we had lost her.
Carmilla,all my efforts to find her were vain.
Carmilla,i feared that she had mistaken  in the confusion of a momentary separation from us  other people for her new friends  and had  possibly  pursued and lost them in the extensive grounds which were thrown open to us.
Carmilla,now  in its full force  i recognized a new folly in my having undertaken the charge of a young lady without so much as knowing her name  and fettered as i was by promises  of the reasons for imposing which i knew nothing  i could not even point my inquiries by saying that the missing young lady was the daughter of the countess who had taken her departure a few hours before.
Carmilla,morning broke.
Carmilla,it was clear daylight before i gave up my search.
Carmilla,it was not till near two o   clock next day that we heard anything of my missing charge.
Carmilla,at about that time a servant knocked at my niece   s door  to say that he had been earnestly requested by a young lady  who appeared to be in great distress  to make out where she could find the general baron spielsdorf and the young lady his daughter  in whose charge she had been left by her mother.
Carmilla,there could be no doubt  notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy  that our young friend had turned up  and so she had.
Carmilla,would to heaven we had lost her      she told my poor child a story to account for her having failed to recover us for so long.
Carmilla,very late  she said  she had got to the housekeeper   s bedroom in despair of finding us  and had then fallen into a deep sleep which  long as it was  had hardly sufficed to recruit her strength after the fatigues of the ball.
Carmilla,that day millarca came home with us.
Carmilla,i was only too happy  after all  to have secured so charming a companion for my dear girl.
Carmilla,there soon  however  appeared some drawbacks.
Carmilla,in the first place  millarca complained of extreme languor   the weakness that remained after her late illness   and she never emerged from her room till the afternoon was pretty far advanced.
Carmilla,in the next place  it was accidentally discovered  although she always locked her door on the inside  and never disturbed the key from its place till she admitted the maid to assist at her toilet  that she was undoubtedly sometimes absent from her room in the very early morning  and at various times later in the day  before she wished it to be understood that she was stirring.
Carmilla,she was repeatedly seen from the windows of the schloss  in the first faint grey of the morning  walking through the trees  in an easterly direction  and looking like a person in a trance.
Carmilla,this convinced me that she walked in her sleep.
Carmilla,but this hypothesis did not solve the puzzle.
Carmilla,how did she pass out from her room  leaving the door locked on the inside  how did she escape from the house without unbarring door or window      in the midst of my perplexities  an anxiety of a far more urgent kind presented itself.
Carmilla,my dear child began to lose her looks and health  and that in a manner so mysterious  and even horrible  that i became thoroughly frightened.
Carmilla,she was at first visited by appalling dreams  then  as she fancied  by a specter  sometimes resembling millarca  sometimes in the shape of a beast  indistinctly seen  walking round the foot of her bed  from side to side.
Carmilla,lastly came sensations.
Carmilla,one  not unpleasant  but very peculiar  she said  resembled the flow of an icy stream against her breast.
Carmilla,at a later time  she felt something like a pair of large needles pierce her  a little below the throat  with a very sharp pain.
Carmilla,a few nights after  followed a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation  then came unconsciousness.
Carmilla,i could hear distinctly every word the kind old general was saying  because by this time we were driving upon the short grass that spreads on either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which had not shown the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century.
Carmilla,you may guess how strangely i felt as i heard my own symptoms so exactly described in those which had been experienced by the poor girl who  but for the catastrophe which followed  would have been at that moment a visitor at my father   s chateau.
Carmilla,you may suppose  also  how i felt as i heard him detail habits and mysterious peculiarities which were  in fact  those of our beautiful guest  carmilla   a vista opened in the forest  we were on a sudden under the chimneys and gables of the ruined village  and the towers and battlements of the dismantled castle  round which gigantic trees are grouped  overhung us from a slight eminence.
Carmilla,in a frightened dream i got down from the carriage  and in silence  for we had each abundant matter for thinking  we soon mounted the ascent  and were among the spacious chambers  winding stairs  and dark corridors of the castle.
Carmilla,and this was once the palatial residence of the karnsteins    said the old general at length  as from a great window he looked out across the village  and saw the wide  undulating expanse of forest.
Carmilla,it was a bad family  and here its bloodstained annals were written    he continued.
Carmilla,it is hard that they should  after death  continue to plague the human race with their atrocious lusts.
Carmilla,that is the chapel of the karnsteins  down there.
Carmilla,he pointed down to the grey walls of the gothic building partly visible through the foliage  a little way down the steep.
Carmilla,and i hear the axe of a woodman    he added     busy among the trees that surround it  he possibly may give us the information of which i am in search  and point out the grave of mircalla  countess of karnstein.
Carmilla,these rustics preserve the local traditions of great families  whose stories die out among the rich and titled so soon as the families themselves become extinct.
Carmilla,we have a portrait  at home  of mircalla  the countess karnstein  should you like to see it    asked my father.
Carmilla,time enough  dear friend    replied the general.
Carmilla,i believe that i have seen the original  and one motive which has led me to you earlier than i at first intended  was to explore the chapel which we are now approaching.
Carmilla,what  see the countess mircalla    exclaimed my father     why  she has been dead more than a century        not so dead as you fancy  i am told    answered the general.
Carmilla,i confess  general  you puzzle me utterly    replied my father  looking at him  i fancied  for a moment with a return of the suspicion i detected before.
Carmilla,but although there was anger and detestation  at times  in the old general   s manner  there was nothing flighty.
Carmilla,there remains to me    he said  as we passed under the heavy arch of the gothic church   for its dimensions would have justified its being so styled      but one object which can interest me during the few years that remain to me on earth  and that is to wreak on her the vengeance which  i thank god  may still be accomplished by a mortal arm.
Carmilla,what vengeance can you mean    asked my father  in increasing amazement.
Carmilla,i mean  to decapitate the monster    he answered  with a fierce flush  and a stamp that echoed mournfully through the hollow ruin  and his clenched hand was at the same moment raised  as if it grasped the handle of an axe  while he shook it ferociously in the air.
Carmilla,what    exclaimed my father  more than ever bewildered.
Carmilla,to strike her head off.
Carmilla,cut her head off        aye  with a hatchet  with a spade  or with anything that can cleave through her murderous throat.
Carmilla,you shall hear    he answered  trembling with rage.
Carmilla,and hurrying forward he said      that beam will answer for a seat  your dear child is fatigued  let her be seated  and i will  in a few sentences  close my dreadful story.
Carmilla,the squared block of wood  which lay on the grass grown pavement of the chapel  formed a bench on which i was very glad to seat myself  and in the meantime the general called to the woodman  who had been removing some boughs which leaned upon the old walls  and  axe in hand  the hardy old fellow stood before us.
Carmilla,he could not tell us anything of these monuments  but there was an old man  he said  a ranger of this forest  at present sojourning in the house of the priest  about two miles away  who could point out every monument of the old karnstein family  and  for a trifle  he undertook to bring him back with him  if we would lend him one of our horses  in little more than half an hour.
Carmilla,have you been long employed about this forest    asked my father of the old man.
Carmilla,i have been a woodman here    he answered in his patois     under the forester  all my days  so has my father before me  and so on  as many generations as i can count up.
Carmilla,i could show you the very house in the village here  in which my ancestors lived.
Carmilla,how came the village to be deserted    asked the general.
Carmilla,it was troubled by revenants  sir  several were tracked to their graves  there detected by the usual tests  and extinguished in the usual way  by decapitation  by the stake  and by burning  but not until many of the villagers were killed.
Carmilla,but after all these proceedings according to law    he continued      so many graves opened  and so many vampires deprived of their horrible animation   the village was not relieved.
Carmilla,but a moravian nobleman  who happened to be traveling this way  heard how matters were  and being skilled   as many people are in his country   in such affairs  he offered to deliver the village from its tormentor.
Carmilla,he did so thus  there being a bright moon that night  he ascended  shortly after sunset  the towers of the chapel here  from whence he could distinctly see the churchyard beneath him  you can see it from that window.
Carmilla,from this point he watched until he saw the vampire come out of his grave  and place near it the linen clothes in which he had been folded  and then glide away towards the village to plague its inhabitants.
Carmilla,the stranger  having seen all this  came down from the steeple  took the linen wrappings of the vampire  and carried them up to the top of the tower  which he again mounted.
Carmilla,when the vampire returned from his prowlings and missed his clothes  he cried furiously to the moravian  whom he saw at the summit of the tower  and who  in reply  beckoned him to ascend and take them.
Carmilla,whereupon the vampire  accepting his invitation  began to climb the steeple  and so soon as he had reached the battlements  the moravian  with a stroke of his sword  clove his skull in twain  hurling him down to the churchyard  whither  descending by the winding stairs  the stranger followed and cut his head off  and next day delivered it and the body to the villagers  who duly impaled and burnt them.
Carmilla,this moravian nobleman had authority from the then head of the family to remove the tomb of mircalla  countess karnstein  which he did effectually  so that in a little while its site was quite forgotten.
Carmilla,can you point out where it stood    asked the general  eagerly.
Carmilla,the forester shook his head  and smiled.
Carmilla,not a soul living could tell you that now    he said     besides  they say her body was removed  but no one is sure of that either.
Carmilla,having thus spoken  as time pressed  he dropped his axe and departed  leaving us to hear the remainder of the general   s strange story.
Carmilla,my beloved child    he resumed     was now growing rapidly worse.
Carmilla,the physician who attended her had failed to produce the slightest impression on her disease  for such i then supposed it to be.
Carmilla,he saw my alarm  and suggested a consultation.
Carmilla,i called in an abler physician  from gratz.
Carmilla,several days elapsed before he arrived.
Carmilla,he was a good and pious  as well as a learned man.
Carmilla,having seen my poor ward together  they withdrew to my library to confer and discuss.
Carmilla,i  from the adjoining room  where i awaited their summons  heard these two gentlemen   s voices raised in something sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion.
Carmilla,i knocked at the door and entered.
Carmilla,i found the old physician from gratz maintaining his theory.
Carmilla,his rival was combating it with undisguised ridicule  accompanied with bursts of laughter.
Carmilla,this unseemly manifestation subsided and the altercation ended on my entrance.
Carmilla,sir     said my first physician    my learned brother seems to think that you want a conjuror  and not a doctor.
Carmilla,pardon me     said the old physician from gratz  looking displeased     i shall state my own view of the case in my own way another time.
Carmilla,i grieve  monsieur le general  that by my skill and science i can be of no use.
Carmilla,before i go i shall do myself the honor to suggest something to you.
Carmilla,he seemed thoughtful  and sat down at a table and began to write.
Carmilla,profoundly disappointed  i made my bow  and as i turned to go  the other doctor pointed over his shoulder to his companion who was writing  and then  with a shrug  significantly touched his forehead.
Carmilla,this consultation  then  left me precisely where i was.
Carmilla,i walked out into the grounds  all but distracted.
Carmilla,the doctor from gratz  in ten or fifteen minutes  overtook me.
Carmilla,he apologized for having followed me  but said that he could not conscientiously take his leave without a few words more.
Carmilla,he told me that he could not be mistaken  no natural disease exhibited the same symptoms  and that death was already very near.
Carmilla,there remained  however  a day  or possibly two  of life.
Carmilla,if the fatal seizure were at once arrested  with great care and skill her strength might possibly return.
Carmilla,but all hung now upon the confines of the irrevocable.
Carmilla,one more assault might extinguish the last spark of vitality which is  every moment  ready to die.
Carmilla,and what is the nature of the seizure you speak of     i entreated.
Carmilla,i have stated all fully in this note  which i place in your hands upon the distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman  and open my letter in his presence  and on no account read it till he is with you  you would despise it else  and it is a matter of life and death.
Carmilla,should the priest fail you  then  indeed  you may read it.
Carmilla,he asked me  before taking his leave finally  whether i would wish to see a man curiously learned upon the very subject  which  after i had read his letter  would probably interest me above all others  and he urged me earnestly to invite him to visit him there  and so took his leave.
Carmilla,the ecclesiastic was absent  and i read the letter by myself.
Carmilla,at another time  or in another case  it might have excited my ridicule.
Carmilla,but into what quackeries will not people rush for a last chance  where all accustomed means have failed  and the life of a beloved object is at stake      nothing  you will say  could be more absurd than the learned man   s letter.
Carmilla,it was monstrous enough to have consigned him to a madhouse.
Carmilla,he said that the patient was suffering from the visits of a vampire  the punctures which she described as having occurred near the throat  were  he insisted  the insertion of those two long  thin  and sharp teeth which  it is well known  are peculiar to vampires  and there could be no doubt  he added  as to the well defined presence of the small livid mark which all concurred in describing as that induced by the demon   s lips  and every symptom described by the sufferer was in exact conformity with those recorded in every case of a similar visitation.
Carmilla,being myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such portent as the vampire  the supernatural theory of the good doctor furnished  in my opinion  but another instance of learning and intelligence oddly associated with some one hallucination.
Carmilla,i was so miserable  however  that  rather than try nothing  i acted upon the instructions of the letter.
Carmilla,i concealed myself in the dark dressing room  that opened upon the poor patient   s room  in which a candle was burning  and watched there till she was fast asleep.
Carmilla,i stood at the door  peeping through the small crevice  my sword laid on the table beside me  as my directions prescribed  until  a little after one  i saw a large black object  very ill defined  crawl  as it seemed to me  over the foot of the bed  and swiftly spread itself up to the poor girl   s throat  where it swelled  in a moment  into a great  palpitating mass.
Carmilla,for a few moments i had stood petrified.
Carmilla,i now sprang forward  with my sword in my hand.
Carmilla,the black creature suddenly contracted towards the foot of the bed  glided over it  and  standing on the floor about a yard below the foot of the bed  with a glare of skulking ferocity and horror fixed on me  i saw millarca.
Carmilla,speculating i know not what  i struck at her instantly with my sword  but i saw her standing near the door  unscathed.
Carmilla,horrified  i pursued  and struck again.
Carmilla,she was gone  and my sword flew to shivers against the door.
Carmilla,i can   t describe to you all that passed on that horrible night.
Carmilla,the whole house was up and stirring.
Carmilla,the specter millarca was gone.
Carmilla,but her victim was sinking fast  and before the morning dawned  she died.
Carmilla,the old general was agitated.
Carmilla,we did not speak to him.
Carmilla,my father walked to some little distance  and began reading the inscriptions on the tombstones  and thus occupied  he strolled into the door of a side chapel to prosecute his researches.
Carmilla,the general leaned against the wall  dried his eyes  and sighed heavily.
Carmilla,i was relieved on hearing the voices of carmilla and madame  who were at that moment approaching.
Carmilla,the voices died away.
Carmilla,in this solitude  having just listened to so strange a story  connected  as it was  with the great and titled dead  whose monuments were moldering among the dust and ivy round us  and every incident of which bore so awfully upon my own mysterious case   in this haunted spot  darkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side  dense and high above its noiseless walls   a horror began to steal over me  and my heart sank as i thought that my friends were  after all  not about to enter and disturb this triste and ominous scene.
Carmilla,the old general   s eyes were fixed on the ground  as he leaned with his hand upon the basement of a shattered monument.
Carmilla,under a narrow  arched doorway  surmounted by one of those demoniacal grotesques in which the cynical and ghastly fancy of old gothic carving delights  i saw very gladly the beautiful face and figure of carmilla enter the shadowy chapel.
Carmilla,i was just about to rise and speak  and nodded smiling  in answer to her peculiarly engaging smile  when with a cry  the old man by my side caught up the woodman   s hatchet  and started forward.
Carmilla,on seeing him a brutalized change came over her features.
Carmilla,it was an instantaneous and horrible transformation  as she made a crouching step backwards.
Carmilla,before i could utter a scream  he struck at her with all his force  but she dived under his blow  and unscathed  caught him in her tiny grasp by the wrist.
Carmilla,he struggled for a moment to release his arm  but his hand opened  the axe fell to the ground  and the girl was gone.
Carmilla,he staggered against the wall.
Carmilla,his grey hair stood upon his head  and a moisture shone over his face  as if he were at the point of death.
Carmilla,the frightful scene had passed in a moment.
Carmilla,the first thing i recollect after  is madame standing before me  and impatiently repeating again and again  the question     where is mademoiselle carmilla     i answered at length     i don   t know   i can   t tell   she went there    and i pointed to the door through which madame had just entered     only a minute or two since.
Carmilla,but i have been standing there  in the passage  ever since mademoiselle carmilla entered  and she did not return.
Carmilla,she then began to call    carmilla    through every door and passage and from the windows  but no answer came.
Carmilla,she called herself carmilla    asked the general  still agitated.
Carmilla,carmilla  yes    i answered.
Carmilla,aye    he said     that is millarca.
Carmilla,that is the same person who long ago was called mircalla  countess karnstein.
Carmilla,depart from this accursed ground  my poor child  as quickly as you can.
Carmilla,drive to the clergyman   s house  and stay there till we come.
Carmilla,begone  may you never behold carmilla more  you will not find her here.
Carmilla,as he spoke one of the strangest looking men i ever beheld entered the chapel at the door through which carmilla had made her entrance and her exit.
Carmilla,he was tall  narrow chested  stooping  with high shoulders  and dressed in black.
Carmilla,his face was brown and dried in with deep furrows  he wore an oddly shaped hat with a broad leaf.
Carmilla,his hair  long and grizzled  hung on his shoulders.
Carmilla,he wore a pair of gold spectacles  and walked slowly  with an odd shambling gait  with his face sometimes turned up to the sky  and sometimes bowed down towards the ground  seemed to wear a perpetual smile  his long thin arms were swinging  and his lank hands  in old black gloves ever so much too wide for them  waving and gesticulating in utter abstraction.
Carmilla,the very man    exclaimed the general  advancing with manifest delight.
Carmilla,my dear baron  how happy i am to see you  i had no hope of meeting you so soon.
Carmilla,he signed to my father  who had by this time returned  and leading the fantastic old gentleman  whom he called the baron to meet him.
Carmilla,he introduced him formally  and they at once entered into earnest conversation.
Carmilla,the stranger took a roll of paper from his pocket  and spread it on the worn surface of a tomb that stood by.
Carmilla,he had a pencil case in his fingers  with which he traced imaginary lines from point to point on the paper  which from their often glancing from it  together  at certain points of the building  i concluded to be a plan of the chapel.
Carmilla,he accompanied  what i may term  his lecture  with occasional readings from a dirty little book  whose yellow leaves were closely written over.
Carmilla,they sauntered together down the side aisle  opposite to the spot where i was standing  conversing as they went  then they began measuring distances by paces  and finally they all stood together  facing a piece of the sidewall  which they began to examine with great minuteness  pulling off the ivy that clung over it  and rapping the plaster with the ends of their sticks  scraping here  and knocking there.
Carmilla,at length they ascertained the existence of a broad marble tablet  with letters carved in relief upon it.
Carmilla,with the assistance of the woodman  who soon returned  a monumental inscription  and carved escutcheon  were disclosed.
Carmilla,they proved to be those of the long lost monument of mircalla  countess karnstein.
Carmilla,the old general  though not i fear given to the praying mood  raised his hands and eyes to heaven  in mute thanksgiving for some moments.
Carmilla,tomorrow    i heard him say     the commissioner will be here  and the inquisition will be held according to law.
Carmilla,then turning to the old man with the gold spectacles  whom i have described  he shook him warmly by both hands and said      baron  how can i thank you  how can we all thank you  you will have delivered this region from a plague that has scourged its inhabitants for more than a century.
Carmilla,the horrible enemy  thank god  is at last tracked.
Carmilla,my father led the stranger aside  and the general followed.
Carmilla,i know that he had led them out of hearing  that he might relate my case  and i saw them glance often quickly at me  as the discussion proceeded.
Carmilla,my father came to me  kissed me again and again  and leading me from the chapel  said      it is time to return  but before we go home  we must add to our party the good priest  who lives but a little way from this  and persuade him to accompany us to the schloss.
Carmilla,in this quest we were successful  and i was glad  being unspeakably fatigued when we reached home.
Carmilla,but my satisfaction was changed to dismay  on discovering that there were no tidings of carmilla.
Carmilla,of the scene that had occurred in the ruined chapel  no explanation was offered to me  and it was clear that it was a secret which my father for the present determined to keep from me.
Carmilla,the sinister absence of carmilla made the remembrance of the scene more horrible to me.
Carmilla,the arrangements for the night were singular.
Carmilla,two servants  and madame were to sit up in my room that night  and the ecclesiastic with my father kept watch in the adjoining dressing room.
Carmilla,the priest had performed certain solemn rites that night  the purport of which i did not understand any more than i comprehended the reason of this extraordinary precaution taken for my safety during sleep.
Carmilla,i saw all clearly a few days later.
Carmilla,the disappearance of carmilla was followed by the discontinuance of my nightly sufferings.
Carmilla,you have heard  no doubt  of the appalling superstition that prevails in upper and lower styria  in moravia  silesia  in turkish serbia  in poland  even in russia  the superstition  so we must call it  of the vampire.
Carmilla,if human testimony  taken with every care and solemnity  judicially  before commissions innumerable  each consisting of many members  all chosen for integrity and intelligence  and constituting reports more voluminous perhaps than exist upon any one other class of cases  is worth anything  it is difficult to deny  or even to doubt the existence of such a phenomenon as the vampire.
Carmilla,for my part i have heard no theory by which to explain what i myself have witnessed and experienced  other than that supplied by the ancient and well attested belief of the country.
Carmilla,the next day the formal proceedings took place in the chapel of karnstein.
Carmilla,the grave of the countess mircalla was opened  and the general and my father recognized each his perfidious and beautiful guest  in the face now disclosed to view.
Carmilla,the features  though a hundred and fifty years had passed since her funeral  were tinted with the warmth of life.
Carmilla,her eyes were open  no cadaverous smell exhaled from the coffin.
Carmilla,the two medical men  one officially present  the other on the part of the promoter of the inquiry  attested the marvelous fact that there was a faint but appreciable respiration  and a corresponding action of the heart.
Carmilla,the limbs were perfectly flexible  the flesh elastic  and the leaden coffin floated with blood  in which to a depth of seven inches  the body lay immersed.
Carmilla,here then  were all the admitted signs and proofs of vampirism.
Carmilla,the body  therefore  in accordance with the ancient practice  was raised  and a sharp stake driven through the heart of the vampire  who uttered a piercing shriek at the moment  in all respects such as might escape from a living person in the last agony.
Carmilla,then the head was struck off  and a torrent of blood flowed from the severed neck.
Carmilla,the body and head was next placed on a pile of wood  and reduced to ashes  which were thrown upon the river and borne away  and that territory has never since been plagued by the visits of a vampire.
Carmilla,my father has a copy of the report of the imperial commission  with the signatures of all who were present at these proceedings  attached in verification of the statement.
Carmilla,it is from this official paper that i have summarized my account of this last shocking scene.
Carmilla,i write all this you suppose with composure.
Carmilla,but far from it  i cannot think of it without agitation.
Carmilla,nothing but your earnest desire so repeatedly expressed  could have induced me to sit down to a task that has unstrung my nerves for months to come  and reinduced a shadow of the unspeakable horror which years after my deliverance continued to make my days and nights dreadful  and solitude insupportably terrific.
Carmilla,let me add a word or two about that quaint baron vordenburg  to whose curious lore we were indebted for the discovery of the countess mircalla   s grave.
Carmilla,he had taken up his abode in gratz  where  living upon a mere pittance  which was all that remained to him of the once princely estates of his family  in upper styria  he devoted himself to the minute and laborious investigation of the marvelously authenticated tradition of vampirism.
Carmilla,he had at his fingers    ends all the great and little works upon the subject.
Carmilla,magia posthuma       phlegon de mirabilibus       augustinus de cura pro mortuis       philosophicae et christianae cogitationes de vampiris    by john christofer herenberg  and a thousand others  among which i remember only a few of those which he lent to my father.
Carmilla,he had a voluminous digest of all the judicial cases  from which he had extracted a system of principles that appear to govern   some always  and others occasionally only   the condition of the vampire.
Carmilla,i may mention  in passing  that the deadly pallor attributed to that sort of revenants  is a mere melodramatic fiction.
Carmilla,they present  in the grave  and when they show themselves in human society  the appearance of healthy life.
Carmilla,when disclosed to light in their coffins  they exhibit all the symptoms that are enumerated as those which proved the vampire life of the long dead countess karnstein.
Carmilla,how they escape from their graves and return to them for certain hours every day  without displacing the clay or leaving any trace of disturbance in the state of the coffin or the cerements  has always been admitted to be utterly inexplicable.
Carmilla,the amphibious existence of the vampire is sustained by daily renewed slumber in the grave.
Carmilla,its horrible lust for living blood supplies the vigor of its waking existence.
Carmilla,the vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing vehemence  resembling the passion of love  by particular persons.
Carmilla,in pursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem  for access to a particular object may be obstructed in a hundred ways.
Carmilla,it will never desist until it has satiated its passion  and drained the very life of its coveted victim.
Carmilla,but it will  in these cases  husband and protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of an epicure  and heighten it by the gradual approaches of an artful courtship.
Carmilla,in these cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent.
Carmilla,in ordinary ones it goes direct to its object  overpowers with violence  and strangles and exhausts often at a single feast.
Carmilla,the vampire is  apparently  subject  in certain situations  to special conditions.
Carmilla,in the particular instance of which i have given you a relation  mircalla seemed to be limited to a name which  if not her real one  should at least reproduce  without the omission or addition of a single letter  those  as we say  anagrammatically  which compose it.
Carmilla,carmilla did this  so did millarca.
Carmilla,my father related to the baron vordenburg  who remained with us for two or three weeks after the expulsion of carmilla  the story about the moravian nobleman and the vampire at karnstein churchyard  and then he asked the baron how he had discovered the exact position of the long concealed tomb of the countess mircalla  the baron   s grotesque features puckered up into a mysterious smile  he looked down  still smiling on his worn spectacle case and fumbled with it.
Carmilla,then looking up  he said      i have many journals  and other papers  written by that remarkable man  the most curious among them is one treating of the visit of which you speak  to karnstein.
Carmilla,the tradition  of course  discolors and distorts a little.
Carmilla,he might have been termed a moravian nobleman  for he had changed his abode to that territory  and was  beside  a noble.
Carmilla,but he was  in truth  a native of upper styria.
Carmilla,it is enough to say that in very early youth he had been a passionate and favored lover of the beautiful mircalla  countess karnstein.
Carmilla,her early death plunged him into inconsolable grief.
Carmilla,it is the nature of vampires to increase and multiply  but according to an ascertained and ghostly law.
Carmilla,assume  at starting  a territory perfectly free from that pest.
Carmilla,how does it begin  and how does it multiply itself  i will tell you.
Carmilla,a person  more or less wicked  puts an end to himself.
Carmilla,a suicide  under certain circumstances  becomes a vampire.
Carmilla,that specter visits living people in their slumbers  they die  and almost invariably  in the grave  develop into vampires.
Carmilla,this happened in the case of the beautiful mircalla  who was haunted by one of those demons.
Carmilla,my ancestor  vordenburg  whose title i still bear  soon discovered this  and in the course of the studies to which he devoted himself  learned a great deal more.
Carmilla,among other things  he concluded that suspicion of vampirism would probably fall  sooner or later  upon the dead countess  who in life had been his idol.
Carmilla,he conceived a horror  be she what she might  of her remains being profaned by the outrage of a posthumous execution.
Carmilla,he has left a curious paper to prove that the vampire  on its expulsion from its amphibious existence  is projected into a far more horrible life  and he resolved to save his once beloved mircalla from this.
Carmilla,he adopted the stratagem of a journey here  a pretended removal of her remains  and a real obliteration of her monument.
Carmilla,when age had stolen upon him  and from the vale of years  he looked back on the scenes he was leaving  he considered  in a different spirit  what he had done  and a horror took possession of him.
Carmilla,he made the tracings and notes which have guided me to the very spot  and drew up a confession of the deception that he had practiced.
Carmilla,if he had intended any further action in this matter  death prevented him  and the hand of a remote descendant has  too late for many  directed the pursuit to the lair of the beast.
Carmilla,we talked a little more  and among other things he said was this      one sign of the vampire is the power of the hand.
Carmilla,the slender hand of mircalla closed like a vice of steel on the general   s wrist when he raised the hatchet to strike.
Carmilla,but its power is not confined to its grasp  it leaves a numbness in the limb it seizes  which is slowly  if ever  recovered from.
Carmilla,the following spring my father took me a tour through italy.
Carmilla,we remained away for more than a year.
Carmilla,it was long before the terror of recent events subsided  and to this hour the image of carmilla returns to memory with ambiguous alternations   sometimes the playful  languid  beautiful girl  sometimes the writhing fiend i saw in the ruined church  and often from a reverie i have started  fancying i heard the light step of carmilla at the drawing room door.
Green Tea,the rev.
Green Tea,mr. jennings is tall and thin.
Green Tea,he is middle aged  and dresses with a natty  old fashioned  high church precision.
Green Tea,he is naturally a little stately  but not at all stiff.
Green Tea,his features  without being handsome  are well formed  and their expression extremely kind  but also shy.
Green Tea,i met him one evening at lady mary heyduke   s. the modesty and benevolence of his countenance are extremely prepossessing.
Green Tea,we were but a small party  and he joined agreeably enough in the conversation.
Green Tea,he seems to enjoy listening very much more than contributing to the talk  but what he says is always to the purpose and well said.
Green Tea,he is a great favourite of lady mary   s  who it seems  consults him upon many things  and thinks him the most happy and blessed person on earth.
Green Tea,little knows she about him.
Green Tea,the rev.
Green Tea,mr. jennings is a bachelor  and has  they say  sixty thousand pounds in the funds.
Green Tea,he is a charitable man.
Green Tea,he is most anxious to be actively employed in his sacred profession  and yet though always tolerably well elsewhere  when he goes down to his vicarage in warwickshire  to engage in the actual duties of his sacred calling his health soon fails him  and in a very strange way.
Green Tea,so says lady mary.
Green Tea,there is no doubt that mr. jennings    health does break down in  generally a sudden and mysterious way  sometimes in the very act of officiating in his old and pretty church at kenlis.
Green Tea,it may be his heart  it may be his brain.
Green Tea,but so it has happened three or four times  or oftener  that after proceeding a certain way in the service  he has on a sudden stopped short  and after a silence  apparently quite unable to resume  he has fallen into solitary  inaudible prayer  his hands and eyes uplifted  and then pale as death  and in the agitation of a strange shame and horror  descended trembling  and got into the vestry room  leaving his congregation  without explanation  to themselves.
Green Tea,this occurred when his curate was absent.
Green Tea,when he goes down to kenlis  now  he always takes care to provide a clergyman to share his duty  and to supply his place on the instant should he become thus suddenly incapacitated.
Green Tea,when mr. jennings breaks down quite  and beats a retreat from the vicarage  and returns to london  where  in a dark street off piccadilly  he inhabits a very narrow house  lady mary says that he is always perfectly well.
Green Tea,i have my own opinion about that.
Green Tea,there are degrees of course.
Green Tea,we shall see.
Green Tea,mr. jennings is a perfectly gentleman like man.
Green Tea,people  however  remark something odd.
Green Tea,there is an impression a little ambiguous.
Green Tea,one thing which certainly contributes to it  people i think don   t remember  or  perhaps  distinctly remark.
Green Tea,but i did  almost immediately.
Green Tea,mr. jennings has a way of looking sidelong upon the carpet  as if his eye followed the movements of something there.
Green Tea,this  of course  is not always.
Green Tea,it occurs only now and then.
Green Tea,but often enough to give a certain oddity  as i have said to his manner  and in this glance travelling along the floor there is something both shy and anxious.
Green Tea,a medical philosopher  as you are good enough to call me  elaborating theories by the aid of cases sought out by himself  and by him watched and scrutinised with more time at command  and consequently infinitely more minuteness than the ordinary practitioner can afford  falls insensibly into habits of observation  which accompany him everywhere  and are exercised  as some people would say  impertinently  upon every subject that presents itself with the least likelihood of rewarding inquiry.
Green Tea,there was a promise of this kind in the slight  timid  kindly  but reserved gentleman  whom i met for the first time at this agreeable little evening gathering.
Green Tea,i observed  of course  more than i here set down  but i reserve all that borders on the technical for a strictly scientific paper.
Green Tea,i may remark  that when i here speak of medical science  i do so  as i hope some day to see it more generally understood  in a much more comprehensive sense than its generally material treatment would warrant.
Green Tea,i believe the entire natural world is but the ultimate expression of that spiritual world from which  and in which alone  it has its life.
Green Tea,i believe that the essential man is a spirit  that the spirit is an organised substance  but as different in point of material from what we ordinarily understand by matter  as light or electricity is  that the material body is  in the most literal sense  a vesture  and death consequently no interruption of the living man   s existence  but simply his extrication from the natural body   a process which commences at the moment of what we term death  and the completion of which  at furthest a few days later  is the resurrection    in power.
Green Tea,the person who weighs the consequences of these positions will probably see their practical bearing upon medical science.
Green Tea,this is  however  by no means the proper place for displaying the proofs and discussing the consequences of this too generally unrecognised state of facts.
Green Tea,in pursuance of my habit  i was covertly observing mr. jennings  with all my caution   i think he perceived it   and i saw plainly that he was as cautiously observing me.
Green Tea,lady mary happening to address me by my name  as dr. hesselius  i saw that he glanced at me more sharply  and then became thoughtful for a few minutes.
Green Tea,after this  as i conversed with a gentleman at the other end of the room  i saw him look at me more steadily  and with an interest which i thought i understood.
Green Tea,i then saw him take an opportunity of chatting with lady mary  and was  as one always is  perfectly aware of being the subject of a distant inquiry and answer.
Green Tea,this tall clergyman approached me by and by  and in a little time we had got into conversation.
Green Tea,when two people  who like reading  and know books and places  having travelled  wish to converse  it is very strange if they can   t find topics.
Green Tea,it was not accident that brought him near me  and led him into conversation.
Green Tea,he knew german  and had read my essays on metaphysical medicine which suggest more than they actually say.
Green Tea,this courteous man  gentle  shy  plainly a man of thought and reading  who moving and talking among us  was not altogether of us  and whom i already suspected of leading a life whose transactions and alarms were carefully concealed  with an impenetrable reserve from  not only the world  but his best beloved friends   was cautiously weighing in his own mind the idea of taking a certain step with regard to me.
Green Tea,i penetrated his thoughts without his being aware of it  and was careful to say nothing which could betray to his sensitive vigilance my suspicions respecting his position  or my surmises about his plans respecting myself.
Green Tea,we chatted upon indifferent subjects for a time  but at last he said      i was very much interested by some papers of yours  dr. hesselius  upon what you term metaphysical medicine   i read them in german  ten or twelve years ago   have they been translated        no  i   m sure they have not   i should have heard.
Green Tea,they would have asked my leave  i think.
Green Tea,i asked the publishers here  a few months ago  to get the book for me in the original german  but they tell me it is out of print.
Green Tea,so it is  and has been for some years  but it flatters me as an author to find that you have not forgotten my little book  although    i added  laughing     ten or twelve years is a considerable time to have managed without it  but i suppose you have been turning the subject over again in your mind  or something has happened lately to revive your interest in it.
Green Tea,at this remark  accompanied by a glance of inquiry  a sudden embarrassment disturbed mr. jennings  analogous to that which makes a young lady blush and look foolish.
Green Tea,he dropped his eyes  and folded his hands together uneasily  and looked oddly  and you would have said  guiltily for a moment.
Green Tea,i helped him out of his awkwardness in the best way  by appearing not to observe it  and going straight on  i said     those revivals of interest in a subject happen to me often  one book suggests another  and often sends me back a wild goose chase over an interval of twenty years.
Green Tea,but if you still care to possess a copy  i shall be only too happy to provide you  i have still got two or three by me   and if you allow me to present one i shall be very much honoured.
Green Tea,you are very good indeed    he said  quite at his ease again  in a moment     i almost despaired   i don   t know how to thank you.
Green Tea,pray don   t say a word  the thing is really so little worth that i am only ashamed of having offered it  and if you thank me any more i shall throw it into the fire in a fit of modesty.
Green Tea,mr. jennings laughed.
Green Tea,he inquired where i was staying in london  and after a little more conversation on a variety of subjects  he took his departure.
Green Tea,   i like your vicar so much  lady mary    said i  so soon as he was gone.
Green Tea,he has read  travelled  and thought  and having also suffered  he ought to be an accomplished companion.
Green Tea,so he is  and  better still  he is a really good man    said she.
Green Tea,his advice is invaluable about my schools  and all my little undertakings at dawlbridge  and he   s so painstaking  he takes so much trouble   you have no idea   wherever he thinks he can be of use  he   s so good natured and so sensible.
Green Tea,it is pleasant to hear so good an account of his neighbourly virtues.
Green Tea,i can only testify to his being an agreeable and gentle companion  and in addition to what you have told me  i think i can tell you two or three things about him    said i.
Green Tea,really        yes  to begin with  he   s unmarried.
Green Tea,yes  that   s right    go on.
Green Tea,he has been writing  that is he was  but for two or three years perhaps  he has not gone on with his work  and the book was upon some rather abstract subject   perhaps theology.
Green Tea,well  he was writing a book  as you say  i   m not quite sure what it was about  but only that it was nothing that i cared for  very likely you are right  and he certainly did stop   yes.
Green Tea,and although he only drank a little coffee here to night  he likes tea  at least  did like it  extravagantly.
Green Tea,yes  that   s quite true.
Green Tea,he drank green tea  a good deal  didn   t he    i pursued.
Green Tea,well  that   s very odd  green tea was a subject on which we used almost to quarrel.
Green Tea,but he has quite given that up    said i.
Green Tea,so he has.
Green Tea,and  now  one more fact.
Green Tea,his mother or his father  did you know them        yes  both  his father is only ten years dead  and their place is near dawlbridge.
Green Tea,we knew them very well    she answered.
Green Tea,well  either his mother or his father   i should rather think his father  saw a ghost    said i.
Green Tea,well  you really are a conjurer  dr. hesselius.
Green Tea,conjurer or no  haven   t i said right    i answered merrily.
Green Tea,you certainly have  and it was his father  he was a silent  whimsical man  and he used to bore my father about his dreams  and at last he told him a story about a ghost he had seen and talked with  and a very odd story it was.
Green Tea,i remember it particularly  because i was so afraid of him.
Green Tea,this story was long before he died   when i was quite a child   and his ways were so silent and moping  and he used to drop in  sometimes  in the dusk  when i was alone in the drawing room  and i used to fancy there were ghosts about him.
Green Tea,i smiled and nodded.
Green Tea,and now having established my character as a conjurer i think i must say good night    said i.
Green Tea,but how did you find it out        by the planets of course  as the gipsies do    i answered  and so  gaily  we said good night.
Green Tea,next morning i sent the little book he had been inquiring after  and a note to mr. jennings  and on returning late that evening  i found that he had called  at my lodgings  and left his card.
Green Tea,he asked whether i was at home  and asked at what hour he would be most likely to find me.
Green Tea,does he intend opening his case  and consulting me    professionally    as they say  i hope so.
Green Tea,i have already conceived a theory about him.
Green Tea,it is supported by lady mary   s answers to my parting questions.
Green Tea,i should like much to ascertain from his own lips.
Green Tea,but what can i do consistently with good breeding to invite a confession  nothing.
Green Tea,i rather think he meditates one.
Green Tea,at all events  my dear van l.  i shan   t make myself difficult of access  i mean to return his visit to morrow.
Green Tea,it will be only civil in return for his politeness  to ask to see him.
Green Tea,perhaps something may come of it.
Green Tea,whether much  little  or nothing  my dear van l.  you shall hear.
Green Tea,well  i have called at blank street.
Green Tea,on inquiring at the door  the servant told me that mr. jennings was engaged very particularly with a gentleman  a clergyman from kenlis  his parish in the country.
Green Tea,intending to reserve my privilege and to call again  i merely intimated that i should try another time  and had turned to go  when the servant begged my pardon  and asked me  looking at me a little more attentively than well bred persons of his order usually do  whether i was dr. hesselius  and  on learning that i was  he said     perhaps then  sir  you would allow me to mention it to mr. jennings  for i am sure he wishes to see you.
Green Tea,the servant returned in a moment  with a message from mr. jennings  asking me to go into his study  which was in effect his back drawing room  promising to be with me in a very few minutes.
Green Tea,this was really a study   almost a library.
Green Tea,the room was lofty  with two tall slender windows  and rich dark curtains.
Green Tea,it was much larger than i had expected  and stored with books on every side  from the floor to the ceiling.
Green Tea,the upper carpet   for to my tread it felt that there were two or three   was a turkey carpet.
Green Tea,my steps fell noiselessly.
Green Tea,the book cases standing out  placed the windows  particularly narrow ones  in deep recesses.
Green Tea,the effect of the room was  although extremely comfortable  and even luxurious  decidedly gloomy  and aided by the silence  almost oppressive.
Green Tea,perhaps  however  i ought to have allowed something for association.
Green Tea,my mind had connected peculiar ideas with mr. jennings.
Green Tea,i stepped into this perfectly silent room  of a very silent house  with a peculiar foreboding  and its darkness  and solemn clothing of books  for except where two narrow looking glasses were set in the wall  they were everywhere  helped this sombre feeling.
Green Tea,while awaiting mr. jennings    arrival  i amused myself by looking into some of the books with which his shelves were laden.
Green Tea,not among these  but immediately under them  with their backs upward  on the floor  i lighted upon a complete set of swedenborg   s arcana c  lestia  in the original latin  a very fine folio set  bound in the natty livery which theology affects  pure vellum  namely  gold letters  and carmine edges.
Green Tea,there were paper markers in several of these volumes  i raised and placed them  one after the other  upon the table  and opening where these papers were placed  i read in the solemn latin phraseology  a series of sentences indicated by a pencilled line at the margin.
Green Tea,of these i copy here a few  translating them into english.
Green Tea,when man   s interior sight is opened  which is that of his spirit  then there appear the things of another life  which cannot possibly be made visible to the bodily sight.
Green Tea,...     by the internal sight it has been granted me to see the things that are in the other life  more clearly than i see those that are in the world.
Green Tea,from these considerations  it is evident that external vision exists from interior vision  and this from a vision still more interior  and so on.
Green Tea,...
Green Tea,there are with every man at least two evil spirits.
Green Tea,...     with wicked genii there is also a fluent speech  but harsh and grating.
Green Tea,there is also among them a speech which is not fluent  wherein the dissent of the thoughts is perceived as something secretly creeping along within it.
Green Tea,...
Green Tea,the evil spirits associated with man are  indeed  from the hells  but when with man they are not then in hell  but are taken out thence.
Green Tea,the place where they then are is in the midst between heaven and hell  and is called the world of spirits   when the evil spirits who are with man  are in that world  they are not in any infernal torment  but in every thought and affection of the man  and so  in all that the man himself enjoys.
Green Tea,but when they are remitted into their hell  they return to their former state.
Green Tea,...
Green Tea,if evil spirits could perceive that they were associated with man  and yet that they were spirits separate from him  and if they could flow in into the things of his body  they would attempt by a thousand means to destroy him  for they hate man with a deadly hatred.
Green Tea,...     knowing  therefore  that i was a man in the body  they were continually striving to destroy me  not as to the body only  but especially as to the soul  for to destroy any man or spirit is the very delight of the life of all who are in hell  but i have been continually protected by the lord.
Green Tea,hence it appears how dangerous it is for man to be in a living consort with spirits  unless he be in the good of faith.
Green Tea,...
Green Tea,nothing is more carefully guarded from the knowledge of associate spirits than their being thus conjoint with a man  for if they knew it they would speak to him  with the intention to destroy him.
Green Tea,...
Green Tea,the delight of hell is to do evil to man  and to hasten his eternal ruin.
Green Tea,a long note  written with a very sharp and fine pencil  in mr. jennings    neat hand  at the foot of the page  caught my eye.
Green Tea,expecting his criticism upon the text  i read a word or two  and stopped  for it was something quite different  and began with these words  deus misereatur mei      may god compassionate me.
Green Tea,thus warned of its private nature  i averted my eyes  and shut the book  replacing all the volumes as i had found them  except one which interested me  and in which  as men studious and solitary in their habits will do  i grew so absorbed as to take no cognisance of the outer world  nor to remember where i was.
Green Tea,i was reading some pages which refer to    representatives   and    correspondents    in the technical language of swedenborg  and had arrived at a passage  the substance of which is  that evil spirits  when seen by other eyes than those of their infernal associates  present themselves  by    correspondence    in the shape of the beast  fera  which represents their particular lust and life  in aspect direful and atrocious.
Green Tea,this is a long passage  and particularises a number of those bestial forms.
Green Tea,i was running the head of my pencil case along the line as i read it  and something caused me to raise my eyes.
Green Tea,directly before me was one of the mirrors i have mentioned  in which i saw reflected the tall shape of my friend mr. jennings leaning over my shoulder  and reading the page at which i was busy  and with a face so dark and wild that i should hardly have known him.
Green Tea,i turned and rose.
Green Tea,he stood erect also  and with an effort laughed a little  saying      i came in and asked you how you did  but without succeeding in awaking you from your book  so i could not restrain my curiosity  and very impertinently  i   m afraid  peeped over your shoulder.
Green Tea,this is not your first time of looking into those pages.
Green Tea,you have looked into swedenborg  no doubt  long ago        oh dear  yes  i owe swedenborg a great deal  you will discover traces of him in the little book on metaphysical medicine  which you were so good as to remember.
Green Tea,although my friend affected a gaiety of manner  there was a slight flush in his face  and i could perceive that he was inwardly much perturbed.
Green Tea,i   m scarcely yet qualified  i know so little of swedenborg.
Green Tea,i   ve only had them a fortnight    he answered     and i think they are rather likely to make a solitary man nervous   that is  judging from the very little i have read   i don   t say that they have made me so    he laughed     and i   m so very much obliged for the book.
Green Tea,i hope you got my note     i made all proper acknowledgments and modest disclaimers.
Green Tea,i never read a book that i go with  so entirely  as that of yours    he continued.
Green Tea,i saw at once there is more in it than is quite unfolded.
Green Tea,do you know dr. harley    he asked  rather abruptly.
Green Tea,in passing  the editor remarks that the physician here named was one of the most eminent who had ever practised in england.
Green Tea,i did  having had letters to him  and had experienced from him great courtesy and considerable assistance during my visit to england.
Green Tea,i think that man one of the very greatest fools i ever met in my life    said mr. jennings.
Green Tea,this was the first time i had ever heard him say a sharp thing of anybody  and such a term applied to so high a name a little startled me.
Green Tea,really  and in what way    i asked.
Green Tea,in his profession    he answered.
Green Tea,i smiled.
Green Tea,i mean this    he said     he seems to me  one half  blind   i mean one half of all he looks at is dark   preternaturally bright and vivid all the rest  and the worst of it is  it seems wilful.
Green Tea,i can   t get him   i mean he won   t   i   ve had some experience of him as a physician  but i look on him as  in that sense  no better than a paralytic mind  an intellect half dead  i   ll tell you   i know i shall some time   all about it    he said  with a little agitation.
Green Tea,you stay some months longer in england.
Green Tea,if i should be out of town during your stay for a little time  would you allow me to trouble you with a letter        i should be only too happy    i assured him.
Green Tea,very good of you.
Green Tea,i am so utterly dissatisfied with harley.
Green Tea,a little leaning to the materialistic school    i said.
Green Tea,a mere materialist    he corrected me     you can   t think how that sort of thing worries one who knows better.
Green Tea,you won   t tell any one   any of my friends you know   that i am hippish  now  for instance  no one knows   not even lady mary   that i have seen dr. harley  or any other doctor.
Green Tea,so pray don   t mention it  and  if i should have any threatening of an attack  you   ll kindly let me write  or  should i be in town  have a little talk with you.
Green Tea,i was full of conjecture  and unconsciously i found i had fixed my eyes gravely on him  for he lowered his for a moment  and he said      i see you think i might as well tell you now  or else you are forming a conjecture  but you may as well give it up.
Green Tea,if you were guessing all the rest of your life  you will never hit on it.
Green Tea,he shook his head smiling  and over that wintry sunshine a black cloud suddenly came down  and he drew his breath in  through his teeth as men do in pain.
Green Tea,sorry  of course  to learn that you apprehend occasion to consult any of us  but  command me when and how you like  and i need not assure you that your confidence is sacred.
Green Tea,he then talked of quite other things  and in a comparatively cheerful way and after a little time  i took my leave.
Green Tea,we parted cheerfully  but he was not cheerful  nor was i.
Green Tea,there are certain expressions of that powerful organ of spirit   the human face   which  although i have seen them often  and possess a doctor   s nerve  yet disturb me profoundly.
Green Tea,one look of mr. jennings haunted me.
Green Tea,it had seized my imagination with so dismal a power that i changed my plans for the evening  and went to the opera  feeling that i wanted a change of ideas.
Green Tea,i heard nothing of or from him for two or three days  when a note in his hand reached me.
Green Tea,it was cheerful  and full of hope.
Green Tea,he said that he had been for some little time so much better   quite well  in fact   that he was going to make a little experiment  and run down for a month or so to his parish  to try whether a little work might not quite set him up.
Green Tea,there was in it a fervent religious expression of gratitude for his restoration  as he now almost hoped he might call it.
Green Tea,a day or two later i saw lady mary  who repeated what his note had announced  and told me that he was actually in warwickshire  having resumed his clerical duties at kenlis  and she added     i begin to think that he is really perfectly well  and that there never was anything the matter  more than nerves and fancy  we are all nervous  but i fancy there is nothing like a little hard work for that kind of weakness  and he has made up his mind to try it.
Green Tea,i should not be surprised if he did not come back for a year.
Green Tea,notwithstanding all this confidence  only two days later i had this note  dated from his house off piccadilly      dear sir.
Green Tea,i have returned disappointed.
Green Tea,if i should feel at all able to see you  i shall write to ask you kindly to call.
Green Tea,at present i am too low  and  in fact  simply unable to say all i wish to say.
Green Tea,pray don   t mention my name to my friends.
Green Tea,i can see no one.
Green Tea,by and by  please god  you shall hear from me.
Green Tea,i mean to take a run into shropshire  where some of my people are.
Green Tea,god bless you  may we  on my return  meet more happily than i can now write.
Green Tea,about a week after this i saw lady mary at her own house  the last person  she said  left in town  and just on the wing for brighton  for the london season was quite over.
Green Tea,she told me that she had heard from mr. jennings    niece  martha  in shropshire.
Green Tea,there was nothing to be gathered from her letter  more than that he was low and nervous.
Green Tea,in those words  of which healthy people think so lightly  what a world of suffering is sometimes hidden   nearly five weeks passed without any further news of mr. jennings.
Green Tea,at the end of that time i received a note from him.
Green Tea,he wrote      i have been in the country  and have had change of air  change of scene  change of faces  change of everything and in everything   but myself.
Green Tea,i have made up my mind  so far as the most irresolute creature on earth can do it  to tell my case fully to you.
Green Tea,if your engagements will permit  pray come to me to day  to morrow  or the next day  but  pray defer as little as possible.
Green Tea,you know not how much i need help.
Green Tea,i have a quiet house at richmond  where i now am.
Green Tea,perhaps you can manage to come to dinner  or to luncheon  or even to tea.
Green Tea,you shall have no trouble in finding me out.
Green Tea,the servant at blank street  who takes this note  will have a carriage at your door at any hour you please  and i am always to be found.
Green Tea,you will say that i ought not to be alone.
Green Tea,i have tried everything.
Green Tea,come and see.
Green Tea,i called up the servant  and decided on going out the same evening  which accordingly i did.
Green Tea,he would have been much better in a lodging house  or hotel  i thought  as i drove up through a short double row of sombre elms to a very old fashioned brick house  darkened by the foliage of these trees  which over topped  and nearly surrounded it.
Green Tea,it was a perverse choice  for nothing could be imagined more triste and silent.
Green Tea,the house  i found  belonged to him.
Green Tea,he had stayed for a day or two in town  and  finding it for some cause insupportable  had come out here  probably because being furnished and his own  he was relieved of the thought and delay of selection  by coming here.
Green Tea,the sun had already set  and the red reflected light of the western sky illuminated the scene with the peculiar effect with which we are all familiar.
Green Tea,the hall seemed very dark  but  getting to the back drawing room  whose windows command the west  i was again in the same dusky light.
Green Tea,i sat down  looking out upon the richly wooded landscape that glowed in the grand and melancholy light which was every moment fading.
Green Tea,the corners of the room were already dark  all was growing dim  and the gloom was insensibly toning my mind  already prepared for what was sinister.
Green Tea,i was waiting alone for his arrival  which soon took place.
Green Tea,the door communicating with the front room opened  and the tall figure of mr. jennings  faintly seen in the ruddy twilight  came  with quiet stealthy steps  into the room.
Green Tea,we shook hands  and  taking a chair to the window  where there was still light enough to enable us to see each other   s faces  he sat down beside me  and  placing his hand upon my arm  with scarcely a word of preface began his narrative.
Green Tea,the faint glow of the west  the pomp of the then lonely woods of richmond  were before us  behind and about us the darkening room  and on the stony face or the sufferer   for the character of his face  though still gentle and sweet  was changed   rested that dim  odd glow which seems to descend and produce  where it touches  lights  sudden though faint  which are lost  almost without gradation  in darkness.
Green Tea,the silence  too  was utter  not a distant wheel  or bark  or whistle from without  and within the depressing stillness of an invalid bachelor   s house.
Green Tea,i guessed well the nature  though not even vaguely the particulars of the revelations i was about to receive  from that fixed face of suffering that so oddly flushed stood out  like a portrait of schalken   s  before its background of darkness.
Green Tea,it began    he said     on the   th of october  three years and eleven weeks ago  and two days   i keep very accurate count  for every day is torment.
Green Tea,if i leave anywhere a chasm in my narrative tell me.
Green Tea,about four years ago i began a work  which had cost me very much thought and reading.
Green Tea,it was upon the religious metaphysics of the ancients.
Green Tea,i know    said i     the actual religion of educated and thinking paganism  quite apart from symbolic worship  a wide and very interesting field.
Green Tea,yes  but not good for the mind   the christian mind  i mean.
Green Tea,paganism is all bound together in essential unity  and  with evil sympathy  their religion involves their art  and both their manners  and the subject is a degrading fascination and the nemesis sure.
Green Tea,god forgive me      i wrote a great deal  i wrote late at night.
Green Tea,i was always thinking on the subject  walking about  wherever i was  everywhere.
Green Tea,it thoroughly infected me.
Green Tea,you are to remember that all the material ideas connected with it were more or less of the beautiful  the subject itself delightfully interesting  and i  then  without a care.
Green Tea,he sighed heavily.
Green Tea,i believe that every one who sets about writing in earnest does his work  as a friend of mine phrased it  on something   tea  or coffee  or tobacco.
Green Tea,i suppose there is a material waste that must be hourly supplied in such occupations  or that we should grow too abstracted  and the mind  as it were  pass out of the body  unless it were reminded often of the connection by actual sensation.
Green Tea,at all events  i felt the want  and i supplied it.
Green Tea,tea was my companion   at first the ordinary black tea  made in the usual way  not too strong  but i drank a good deal  and increased its strength as i went on.
Green Tea,i never experienced an uncomfortable symptom from it.
Green Tea,i began to take a little green tea.
Green Tea,i found the effect pleasanter  it cleared and intensified the power of thought so.
Green Tea,i had come to take it frequently  but not stronger than one might take it for pleasure.
Green Tea,i wrote a great deal out here  it was so quiet  and in this room.
Green Tea,i used to sit up very late  and it became a habit with me to sip my tea   green tea   every now and then as my work proceeded.
Green Tea,i had a little kettle on my table  that swung over a lamp  and made tea two or three times between eleven o   clock and two or three in the morning  my hours of going to bed.
Green Tea,i used to go into town every day.
Green Tea,i was not a monk  and  although i spent an hour or two in a library  hunting up authorities and looking out lights upon my theme  i was in no morbid state as far as i can judge.
Green Tea,i met my friends pretty much as usual  and enjoyed their society  and  on the whole  existence had never been  i think  so pleasant before.
Green Tea,i had met with a man who had some odd old books  german editions in medi  val latin  and i was only too happy to be permitted access to them.
Green Tea,this obliging person   s books were in the city  a very out of the way part of it.
Green Tea,i had rather out stayed my intended hour  and  on coming out  seeing no cab near  i was tempted to get into the omnibus which used to drive past this house.
Green Tea,it was darker than this by the time the    bus had reached an old house  you may have remarked  with four poplars at each side of the door  and there the last passenger but myself got out.
Green Tea,we drove along rather faster.
Green Tea,it was twilight now.
Green Tea,i leaned back in my corner next the door ruminating pleasantly.
Green Tea,the interior of the omnibus was nearly dark.
Green Tea,i had observed in the corner opposite to me at the other side  and at the end next the horses  two small circular reflections  as it seemed to me of a reddish light.
Green Tea,they were about two inches apart  and about the size of those small brass buttons that yachting men used to put upon their jackets.
Green Tea,i began to speculate  as listless men will  upon this trifle  as it seemed.
Green Tea,from what centre did that faint but deep red light come  and from what   glass beads  buttons  toy decorations   was it reflected  we were lumbering along gently  having nearly a mile still to go.
Green Tea,i had not solved the puzzle  and it became in another minute more odd  for these two luminous points  with a sudden jerk  descended nearer the floor  keeping still their relative distance and horizontal position  and then  as suddenly  they rose to the level of the seat on which i was sitting  and i saw them no more.
Green Tea,my curiosity was now really excited  and  before i had time to think  i saw again these two dull lamps  again together near the floor  again they disappeared  and again in their old corner i saw them.
Green Tea,so  keeping my eyes upon them  i edged quietly up my own side  towards the end at which i still saw these tiny discs of red.
Green Tea,there was very little light in the    bus.
Green Tea,it was nearly dark.
Green Tea,i leaned forward to aid my endeavour to discover what these little circles really were.
Green Tea,they shifted their position a little as i did so.
Green Tea,i began now to perceive an outline of something black  and i soon saw with tolerable distinctness the outline of a small black monkey  pushing its face forward in mimicry to meet mine  those were its eyes  and i now dimly saw its teeth grinning at me.
Green Tea,i drew back  not knowing whether it might not meditate a spring.
Green Tea,i fancied that one of the passengers had forgot this ugly pet  and wishing to ascertain something of its temper  though not caring to trust my fingers to it  i poked my umbrella softly towards it.
Green Tea,it remained immovable   up to it   through it  for through it  and back and forward  it passed  without the slightest resistance.
Green Tea,i can   t  in the least  convey to you the kind of horror that i felt.
Green Tea,when i had ascertained that the thing was an illusion  as i then supposed  there came a misgiving about myself and a terror that fascinated me in impotence to remove my gaze from the eyes of the brute for some moments.
Green Tea,as i looked  it made a little skip back  quite into the corner  and i  in a panic  found myself at the door  having put my head out  drawing deep breaths of the outer air  and staring at the lights and trees we were passing  too glad to reassure myself of reality.
Green Tea,i stopped the    bus and got out.
Green Tea,i perceived the man look oddly at me as i paid him.
Green Tea,i daresay there was something unusual in my looks and manner  for i had never felt so strangely before.
Green Tea,when the omnibus drove on  and i was alone upon the road  i looked carefully round to ascertain whether the monkey had followed me.
Green Tea,to my indescribable relief i saw it nowhere.
Green Tea,i can   t describe easily what a shock i had received  and my sense of genuine gratitude on finding myself  as i supposed  quite rid of it.
Green Tea,i had got out a little before we reached this house  two or three hundred steps.
Green Tea,a brick wall runs along the footpath  and inside the wall is a hedge of yew or some dark evergreen of that kind  and within that again the row of fine trees which you may have remarked as you came.
Green Tea,this brick wall is about as high as my shoulder  and happening to raise my eyes i saw the monkey  with that stooping gait  on all fours  walking or creeping  close beside me on top of the wall.
Green Tea,i stopped looking at it with a feeling of loathing and horror.
Green Tea,as i stopped so did it.
Green Tea,it sat up on the wall with its long hands on its knees looking at me.
Green Tea,there was not light enough to see it much more than in outline  nor was it dark enough to bring the peculiar light of its eyes into strong relief.
Green Tea,i still saw  however  that red foggy light plainly enough.
Green Tea,it did not show its teeth  nor exhibit any sign of irritation  but seemed jaded and sulky  and was observing me steadily.
Green Tea,i drew back into the middle of the road.
Green Tea,it was an unconscious recoil  and there i stood  still looking at it  it did not move.
Green Tea,with an instinctive determination to try something   anything  i turned about and walked briskly towards town with a skance look  all the time  watching the movements of the beast.
Green Tea,it crept swiftly along the wall  at exactly my pace.
Green Tea,where the wall ends  near the turn of the road  it came down and with a wiry spring or two brought itself close to my feet  and continued to keep up with me  as i quickened my pace.
Green Tea,it was at my left side  so close to my leg that i felt every moment as if i should tread upon it.
Green Tea,the road was quite deserted and silent  and it was darker every moment.
Green Tea,i stopped dismayed and bewildered  turning as i did so  the other way   i mean  towards this house  away from which i had been walking.
Green Tea,when i stood still  the monkey drew back to a distance of  i suppose  about five or six yards  and remained stationary  watching me.
Green Tea,i had been more agitated than i have said.
Green Tea,i had read  of course  as every one has  something about    spectral illusions     as you physicians term the phenomena of such cases.
Green Tea,i considered my situation  and looked my misfortune in the face.
Green Tea,these affections  i had read  are sometimes transitory and sometimes obstinate.
Green Tea,i had read of cases in which the appearance  at first harmless  had  step by step  degenerated into something direful and insupportable  and ended by wearing its victim out.
Green Tea,still as i stood there  but for my bestial companion  quite alone  i tried to comfort myself by repeating again and again the assurance     the thing is purely disease  a well known physical affection  as distinctly as small pox or neuralgia.
Green Tea,doctors are all agreed on that  philosophy demonstrates it.
Green Tea,i must not be a fool.
Green Tea,i   ve been sitting up too late  and i daresay my digestion is quite wrong  and with god   s help  i shall be all right  and this is but a symptom of nervous dyspepsia.
Green Tea,did i believe all this  not one word of it  no more than any other miserable being ever did who is once seized and riveted in this satanic captivity.
Green Tea,against my convictions  i might say my knowledge  i was simply bullying myself into a false courage.
Green Tea,i now walked homeward.
Green Tea,i had only a few hundred yards to go.
Green Tea,i had forced myself into a sort of resignation  but i had not got over the sickening shock and the flurry of the first certainty of my misfortune.
Green Tea,i made up my mind to pass the night at home.
Green Tea,the brute moved close beside me  and i fancied there was the sort of anxious drawing toward the house  which one sees in tired horses or dogs  sometimes as they come toward home.
Green Tea,i was afraid to go into town  i was afraid of any one   s seeing and recognising me.
Green Tea,i was conscious of an irrepressible agitation in my manner.
Green Tea,also  i was afraid of any violent change in my habits  such as going to a place of amusement  or walking from home in order to fatigue myself.
Green Tea,at the hall door it waited till i mounted the steps  and when the door was opened entered with me.
Green Tea,i drank no tea that night.
Green Tea,i got cigars and some brandy and water.
Green Tea,my idea was that i should act upon my material system  and by living for a while in sensation apart from thought  send myself forcibly  as it it were  into a new groove.
Green Tea,i came up here to this drawing room.
Green Tea,i sat just here.
Green Tea,the monkey then got upon a small table that then stood there.
Green Tea,it looked dazed and languid.
Green Tea,an irrepressible uneasiness as to its movements kept my eyes always upon it.
Green Tea,its eyes were half closed  but i could see them glow.
Green Tea,it was looking steadily at me.
Green Tea,in all situations  at all hours  it is awake and looking at me.
Green Tea,that never changes.
Green Tea,i shall not continue in detail my narrative of this particular night.
Green Tea,i shall describe  rather  the phenomena of the first year  which never varied  essentially.
Green Tea,i shall describe the monkey as it appeared in daylight.
Green Tea,in the dark  as you shall presently hear  there are peculiarities.
Green Tea,it is a small monkey  perfectly black.
Green Tea,it had only one peculiarity   a character of malignity   unfathomable malignity.
Green Tea,during the first year it looked sullen and sick.
Green Tea,but this character of intense malice and vigilance was always underlying that surly languor.
Green Tea,during all that time it acted as if on a plan of giving me as little trouble as was consistent with watching me.
Green Tea,its eyes were never off me  i have never lost sight of it  except in my sleep  light or dark  day or night  since it came here  excepting when it withdraws for some weeks at a time  unaccountably.
Green Tea,in total dark it is visible as in daylight.
Green Tea,i do not mean merely its eyes.
Green Tea,it is all visible distinctly in a halo that resembles a glow of red embers  and which accompanies it in all its movements.
Green Tea,when it leaves me for a time  it is always at night  in the dark  and in the same way.
Green Tea,it grows at first uneasy  and then furious  and then advances towards me  grinning and shaking its paws clenched  and  at the same time  there comes the appearance of fire in the grate.
Green Tea,i never have any fire.
Green Tea,i can   t sleep in the room where there is any  and it draws nearer and nearer to the chimney  quivering  it seems  with rage  and when its fury rises to the highest pitch  it springs into the grate  and up the chimney  and i see it no more.
Green Tea,when first this happened i thought i was released.
Green Tea,i was a new man.
Green Tea,a day passed   a night   and no return  and a blessed week   a week   another week.
Green Tea,i was always on my knees  dr. hesselius  always  thanking god and praying.
Green Tea,a whole month passed of liberty  but on a sudden  it was with me again.
Green Tea,it was with me  and the malice which before was torpid under a sullen exterior  was now active.
Green Tea,it was perfectly unchanged in every other respect.
Green Tea,this new energy was apparent in its activity and its looks  and soon in other ways.
Green Tea,for a time  you will understand  the change was shown only in an increased vivacity  and an air of menace  as if it was always brooding over some atrocious plan.
Green Tea,its eyes  as before  were never off me.
Green Tea,is it here now    i asked.
Green Tea,no    he replied     it has been absent exactly a fortnight and a day   fifteen days.
Green Tea,it has sometimes been away so long as nearly two months  once for three.
Green Tea,its absence always exceeds a fortnight  although it may be but by a single day.
Green Tea,fifteen days having past since i saw it last  it may return now at any moment.
Green Tea,is its return    i asked     accompanied by any peculiar manifestation        nothing   no    he said.
Green Tea,it is simply with me again.
Green Tea,on lifting my eyes from a book  or turning my head  i see it as usual  looking at me  and then it remains  as before  for its appointed time.
Green Tea,i have never told so much and so minutely before to any one.
Green Tea,i perceived that he was agitated  and looking like death  and he repeatedly applied his handkerchief to his forehead  i suggested that he might be tired  and told him that i would call  with pleasure  in the morning  but he said      no  if you don   t mind hearing it all now.
Green Tea,i have got so far  and i should prefer making one effort of it.
Green Tea,when i spoke to dr. harley  i had nothing like so much to tell.
Green Tea,you are a philosophic physician.
Green Tea,you give spirit its proper rank.
Green Tea,if this thing is real       he paused  looking at me with agitated inquiry.
Green Tea,we can discuss it by and by  and very fully.
Green Tea,i will give you all i think    i answered  after an interval.
Green Tea,well   very well.
Green Tea,if it is anything real  i say  it is prevailing  little by little  and drawing me more interiorly into hell.
Green Tea,optic nerves  he talked of.
Green Tea,ah  well   there are other nerves of communication.
Green Tea,may god almighty help me  you shall hear.
Green Tea,its power of action  i tell you  had increased.
Green Tea,its malice became  in a way aggressive.
Green Tea,about two years ago  some questions that were pending between me and the bishop having been settled  i went down to my parish in warwickshire  anxious to find occupation in my profession.
Green Tea,i was not prepared for what happened  although i have since thought i might have apprehended something like it.
Green Tea,the reason of my saying so  is this       he was beginning to speak with a great deal more effort and reluctance  and sighed often  and seemed at times nearly overcome.
Green Tea,but at this time his manner was not agitated.
Green Tea,it was more like that of a sinking patient  who has given himself up.
Green Tea,yes  but i will first tell you about kenlis  my parish.
Green Tea,it was with me when i left this place for dawlbridge.
Green Tea,it was my silent travelling companion  and it remained with me at the vicarage.
Green Tea,when i entered on the discharge of my duties  another change took place.
Green Tea,the thing exhibited an atrocious determination to thwart me.
Green Tea,it was with me in the church   in the reading desk   in the pulpit   within the communion rails.
Green Tea,at last  it reached this extremity  that while i was reading to the congregation  it would spring upon the open book and squat there  so that i was unable to see the page.
Green Tea,this happened more than once.
Green Tea,i left dawlbridge for a time.
Green Tea,i placed myself in dr. harley   s hands.
Green Tea,i did everything he told me.
Green Tea,he gave my case a great deal of thought.
Green Tea,it interested him  i think.
Green Tea,he seemed successful.
Green Tea,for nearly three months i was perfectly free from a return.
Green Tea,i began to think i was safe.
Green Tea,with his full assent i returned to dawlbridge.
Green Tea,i travelled in a chaise.
Green Tea,i was in good spirits.
Green Tea,i was more   i was happy and grateful.
Green Tea,i was returning  as i thought delivered from a dreadful hallucination  to the scene of duties which i longed to enter upon.
Green Tea,it was a beautiful sunny evening  everything looked serene and cheerful  and i was delighted.
Green Tea,i remember looking out of the window to see the spire of my church at kenlis among the trees  at the point where one has the earliest view of it.
Green Tea,it is exactly where the little stream that bounds the parish passes under the road by a culvert  and where it emerges at the road side  a stone with an old inscription is placed.
Green Tea,as we passed this point  i drew my head in and sat down  and in the corner of the chaise was the monkey.
Green Tea,for a moment i felt faint  and then quite wild with despair and horror.
Green Tea,i called to the driver  and got out  and sat down at the road side  and prayed to god silently for mercy.
Green Tea,a despairing resignation supervened.
Green Tea,my companion was with me as i re entered the vicarage.
Green Tea,the same persecution followed.
Green Tea,after a short struggle i submitted  and soon i left the place.
Green Tea,i told you    he said     that the beast has before this become in certain ways aggressive.
Green Tea,i will explain a little.
Green Tea,it seemed to be actuated by intense and increasing fury  whenever i said my prayers  or even meditated prayer.
Green Tea,it amounted at last to a dreadful interruption.
Green Tea,you will ask  how could a silent immaterial phantom effect that  it was thus  whenever i meditated praying  it was always before me  and nearer and nearer.
Green Tea,it used to spring on a table  on the back of a chair  on the chimney piece  and slowly to swing itself from side to side  looking at me all the time.
Green Tea,there is in its motion an indefinable power to dissipate thought  and to contract one   s attention to that monotony  till the ideas shrink  as it were  to a point  and at last to nothing   and unless i had started up  and shook off the catalepsy i have felt as if my mind were on the point of losing itself.
Green Tea,there are other ways    he sighed heavily     thus  for instance  while i pray with my eyes closed  it comes closer and closer  and i see it.
Green Tea,i know it is not to be accounted for physically  but i do actually see it  though my lids are closed  and so it rocks my mind  as it were  and overpowers me  and i am obliged to rise from my knees.
Green Tea,if you had ever yourself known this  you would be acquainted with desperation.
Green Tea,i see  dr. hesselius  that you don   t lose one word of my statement.
Green Tea,i need not ask you to listen specially to what i am now going to tell you.
Green Tea,they talk of the optic nerves  and of spectral illusions  as if the organ of sight was the only point assailable by the influences that have fastened upon me   i know better.
Green Tea,for two years in my direful case that limitation prevailed.
Green Tea,but as food is taken in softly at the lips  and then brought under the teeth  as the tip of the little finger caught in a mill crank will draw in the hand  and the arm  and the whole body  so the miserable mortal who has been once caught firmly by the end of the finest fibre of his nerve  is drawn in and in  by the enormous machinery of hell  until he is as i am.
Green Tea,yes  doctor  as i am  for while i talk to you  and implore relief  i feel that my prayer is for the impossible  and my pleading with the inexorable.
Green Tea,i endeavoured to calm his visibly increasing agitation  and told him that he must not despair.
Green Tea,while we talked the night had overtaken us.
Green Tea,the filmy moonlight was wide over the scene which the window commanded  and i said      perhaps you would prefer having candles.
Green Tea,this light  you know  is odd.
Green Tea,i should wish you  as much as possible  under your usual conditions while i make my diagnosis  shall i call it   otherwise i don   t care.
Green Tea,all lights are the same to me    he said     except when i read or write  i care not if night were perpetual.
Green Tea,i am going to tell you what happened about a year ago.
Green Tea,the thing began to speak to me.
Green Tea,speak  how do you mean   speak as a man does  do you mean        yes  speak in words and consecutive sentences  with perfect coherence and articulation  but there is a peculiarity.
Green Tea,it is not like the tone of a human voice.
Green Tea,it is not by my ears it reaches me   it comes like a singing through my head.
Green Tea,this faculty  the power of speaking to me  will be my undoing.
Green Tea,it won   t let me pray  it interrupts me with dreadful blasphemies.
Green Tea,i dare not go on  i could not.
Green Tea,oh  doctor  can the skill  and thought  and prayers of man avail me nothing        you must promise me  my dear sir  not to trouble yourself with unnecessarily exciting thoughts  confine yourself strictly to the narrative of facts  and recollect  above all  that even if the thing that infests you be as you seem to suppose  a reality with an actual independent life and will  yet it can have no power to hurt you  unless it be given from above  its access to your senses depends mainly upon your physical condition   this is  under god  your comfort and reliance  we are all alike environed.
Green Tea,it is only that in your case  the    paries     the veil of the flesh  the screen  is a little out of repair  and sights and sounds are transmitted.
Green Tea,we must enter on a new course  sir   be encouraged.
Green Tea,i   ll give to night to the careful consideration of the whole case.
Green Tea,you are very good  sir  you think it worth trying  you don   t give me quite up  but  sir  you don   t know  it is gaining such an influence over me  it orders me about  it is such a tyrant  and i   m growing so helpless.
Green Tea,may god deliver me        it orders you about   of course you mean by speech        yes  yes  it is always urging me to crimes  to injure others  or myself.
Green Tea,you see  doctor  the situation is urgent  it is indeed.
Green Tea,when i was in shropshire  a few weeks ago    mr. jennings was speaking rapidly and trembling now  holding my arm with one hand  and looking in my face      i went out one day with a party of friends for a walk  my persecutor  i tell you  was with me at the time.
Green Tea,i lagged behind the rest  the country near the dee  you know  is beautiful.
Green Tea,our path happened to lie near a coal mine  and at the verge of the wood is a perpendicular shaft  they say  a hundred and fifty feet deep.
Green Tea,my niece had remained behind with me   she knows  of course  nothing of the nature of my sufferings.
Green Tea,she knew  however  that i had been ill  and was low  and she remained to prevent my being quite alone.
Green Tea,as we loitered slowly on together the brute that accompanied me was urging me to throw myself down the shaft.
Green Tea,i tell you now   oh  sir  think of it    the one consideration that saved me from that hideous death was the fear lest the shock of witnessing the occurrence should be too much for the poor girl.
Green Tea,i asked her to go on and take her walk with her friends  saying that i could go no further.
Green Tea,she made excuses  and the more i urged her the firmer she became.
Green Tea,she looked doubtful and frightened.
Green Tea,i suppose there was something in my looks or manner that alarmed her  but she would not go  and that literally saved me.
Green Tea,you had no idea  sir  that a living man could be made so abject a slave of satan    he said  with a ghastly groan and a shudder.
Green Tea,there was a pause here  and i said     you were preserved nevertheless.
Green Tea,it was the act of god.
Green Tea,you are in his hands and in the power of no other being  be therefore confident for the future.
Green Tea,i made him have candles lighted  and saw the room looking cheery and inhabited before i left him.
Green Tea,i told him that he must regard his illness strictly as one dependent on physical  though subtle physical  causes.
Green Tea,i told him that he had evidence of god   s care and love in the deliverance which he had just described  and that i had perceived with pain that he seemed to regard its peculiar features as indicating that he had been delivered over to spiritual reprobation.
Green Tea,than such a conclusion nothing could be  i insisted  less warranted  and not only so  but more contrary to facts  as disclosed in his mysterious deliverance from that murderous influence during his shropshire excursion.
Green Tea,first  his niece had been retained by his side without his intending to keep her near him  and  secondly  there had been infused into his mind an irresistible repugnance to execute the dreadful suggestion in her presence.
Green Tea,as i reasoned this point with him  mr. jennings wept.
Green Tea,he seemed comforted.
Green Tea,one promise i exacted  which was that should the monkey at any time return  i should be sent for immediately  and  repeating my assurance that i would give neither time nor thought to any other subject until i had thoroughly investigated his case  and that to morrow he should hear the result  i took my leave.
Green Tea,before getting into the carriage i told the servant that his master was far from well  and that he should make a point of frequently looking into his room.
Green Tea,my own arrangements i made with a view to being quite secure from interruption.
Green Tea,i merely called at my lodgings  and with a travelling desk and carpet bag  set off in a hackney carriage for an inn about two miles out of town  called the horns  a very quiet and comfortable house  with good thick walls.
Green Tea,and there i resolved  without the possibility of intrusion or distraction  to devote some hours of the night  in my comfortable sitting room  to mr. jennings    case  and so much of the morning as it might require.
Green Tea,there occurs here a careful note of dr. hesselius    opinion upon the case and of the habits  dietary  and medicines which he prescribed.
Green Tea,it is curious   some persons would say mystical.
Green Tea,but on the whole i doubt whether it would sufficiently interest a reader of the kind i am likely to meet with  to warrant its being here reprinted.
Green Tea,the whole letter was plainly written at the inn where he had hid himself for the occasion.
Green Tea,the next letter is dated from his town lodgings.
Green Tea,i left town for the inn where i slept last night at half past nine  and did not arrive at my room in town until one o   clock this afternoon.
Green Tea,i found a letter in mr. jennings    hand upon my table.
Green Tea,it had not come by post  and  on inquiry  i learned that mr. jennings    servant had brought it  and on learning that i was not to return until to day  and that no one could tell him my address  he seemed very uncomfortable  and said that his orders from his master were that he was not to return without an answer.
Green Tea,i opened the letter  and read      dear dr. hesselius.
Green Tea,it is here.
Green Tea,you had not been an hour gone when it returned.
Green Tea,it is speaking.
Green Tea,it knows all that has happened.
Green Tea,it knows everything   it knows you  and is frantic and atrocious.
Green Tea,it reviles.
Green Tea,i send you this.
Green Tea,it knows every word i have written   i write.
Green Tea,this i promised  and i therefore write  but i fear very confused  very incoherently.
Green Tea,i am so interrupted  disturbed.
Green Tea,ever yours  sincerely yours      robert lynder jennings.
Green Tea,when did this come    i asked.
Green Tea,about eleven last night  the man was here again  and has been here three times to day.
Green Tea,the last time is about an hour since.
Green Tea,thus answered  and with the notes i had made upon his case in my pocket  i was in a few minutes driving towards richmond  to see mr. jennings.
Green Tea,i by no means  as you perceive  despaired of mr. jennings    case.
Green Tea,he had himself remembered and applied  though quite in a mistaken way  the principle which i lay down in my metaphysical medicine  and which governs all such cases.
Green Tea,i was about to apply it in earnest.
Green Tea,i was profoundly interested  and very anxious to see and examine him while the    enemy   was actually present.
Green Tea,i drove up to the sombre house  and ran up the steps  and knocked.
Green Tea,the door  in a little time  was opened by a tall woman in black silk.
Green Tea,she looked ill  and as if she had been crying.
Green Tea,she curtseyed  and heard my question  but she did not answer.
Green Tea,she turned her face away  extending her hand towards two men who were coming down stairs  and thus having  as it were  tacitly made me over to them  she passed through a side door hastily and shut it.
Green Tea,the man who was nearest the hall  i at once accosted  but being now close to him  i was shocked to see that both his hands were covered with blood.
Green Tea,i drew back a little  and the man passing down stairs merely said in a low tone     here   s the servant  sir.
Green Tea,the servant had stopped on the stairs  confounded and dumb at seeing me.
Green Tea,he was rubbing his hands in a handkerchief  and it was steeped in blood.
Green Tea,jones  what is it  what has happened    i asked  while a sickening suspicion overpowered me.
Green Tea,the man asked me to come up to the lobby.
Green Tea,i was beside him in a moment  and frowning and pallid  with contracted eyes  he told me the horror which i already half guessed.
Green Tea,his master had made away with himself.
Green Tea,i went upstairs with him to the room   what i saw there i won   t tell you.
Green Tea,he had cut his throat with his razor.
Green Tea,it was a frightful gash.
Green Tea,the two men had laid him on the bed and composed his limbs.
Green Tea,it had happened as the immense pool of blood on the floor declared  at some distance between the bed and the window.
Green Tea,there was carpet round his bed  and a carpet under his dressing table  but none on the rest of the floor  for the man said he did not like a carpet on his bedroom.
Green Tea,in this sombre  and now terrible room  one of the great elms that darkened the house was slowly moving the shadow of one of its great boughs upon this dreadful floor.
Green Tea,i beckoned to the servant and we went down stairs together.
Green Tea,i turned off the hall into an old fashioned panelled room  and there standing  i heard all the servant had to tell.
Green Tea,it was not a great deal.
Green Tea,i concluded  sir  from your words  and looks  sir  as you left last night  that you thought my master seriously ill.
Green Tea,i thought it might be that you were afraid of a fit  or something.
Green Tea,so i attended very close to your directions.
Green Tea,he sat up late  till past three o   clock.
Green Tea,he was not writing or reading.
Green Tea,he was talking a great deal to himself  but that was nothing unusual.
Green Tea,at about that hour i assisted him to undress  and left him in his slippers and dressing gown.
Green Tea,i went back softly in about half an hour.
Green Tea,he was in his bed  quite undressed  and a pair of candles lighted on the table beside his bed.
Green Tea,he was leaning on his elbow and looking out at the other side of the bed when i came in.
Green Tea,i asked him if he wanted anything  and he said no.
Green Tea,i don   t know whether it was what you said to me  sir  or something a little unusual about him  but i was uneasy  uncommon uneasy about him last night.
Green Tea,in another half hour  or it might be a little more  i went up again.
Green Tea,i did not hear him talking as before.
Green Tea,i opened the door a little.
Green Tea,the candles were both out  which was not usual.
Green Tea,i had a bedroom candle  and i let the light in  a little bit  looking softly round.
Green Tea,i saw him sitting in that chair beside the dressing table with his clothes on again.
Green Tea,he turned round and looked at me.
Green Tea,i thought it strange he should get up and dress  and put out the candles to sit in the dark  that way.
Green Tea,but i only asked him again if i could do anything for him.
Green Tea,he said  no  rather sharp  i thought.
Green Tea,i asked if i might light the candles  and he said     do as you like  jones     so i lighted them  and i lingered about the room  and he said     tell me truth  jones  why did you come again   you did not hear any one cursing        no  sir     i said  wondering what he could mean.
Green Tea,no     said he  after me     of course  no     and i said to him     wouldn   t it be well  sir  you went to bed  it   s just five o   clock     and he said nothing but     very likely  good night  jones.
Green Tea,so i went  sir  but in less than hour i came again.
Green Tea,the door was fast  and he heard me  and called as i thought from the bed to know what i wanted  and he desired me not to disturb him again.
Green Tea,i lay down and slept for a little.
Green Tea,it must have been between six and seven when i went up again.
Green Tea,the door was still fast  and he made no answer  so i did not like to disturb him  and thinking he was asleep  i left him till nine.
Green Tea,it was his custom to ring when he wished me to come  and i had no particular hour for calling him.
Green Tea,i tapped very gently  and getting no answer  i stayed away a good while  supposing he was getting some rest then.
Green Tea,it was not till eleven o   clock i grew really uncomfortable about him   for at the latest he was never  that i could remember  later than half past ten.
Green Tea,i got no answer.
Green Tea,i knocked and called  and still no answer.
Green Tea,so not being able to force the door  i called thomas from the stables  and together we forced it  and found him in the shocking way you saw.
Green Tea,jones had no more to tell.
Green Tea,poor mr. jennings was very gentle  and very kind.
Green Tea,all his people were fond of him.
Green Tea,i could see that the servant was very much moved.
Green Tea,so  dejected and agitated  i passed from that terrible house  and its dark canopy of elms  and i hope i shall never see it more.
Green Tea,while i write to you i feel like a man who has but half waked from a frightful and monotonous dream.
Green Tea,my memory rejects the picture with incredulity and horror.
Green Tea,yet i know it is true.
Green Tea,it is the story of the process of a poison  a poison which excites the reciprocal action of spirit and nerve  and paralyses the tissue that separates those cognate functions of the senses  the external and the interior.
Green Tea,thus we find strange bed fellows  and the mortal and immortal prematurely make acquaintance.
Green Tea,my dear van l        you have suffered from an affection similar to that which i have just described.
Green Tea,you twice complained of a return of it.
Green Tea,who  under god  cured you  your humble servant  martin hesselius.
Green Tea,let me rather adopt the more emphasised piety of a certain good old french surgeon of three hundred years ago     i treated  and god cured you.
Green Tea,come  my friend  you are not to be hippish.
Green Tea,let me tell you a fact.
Green Tea,i have met with  and treated  as my book shows  fifty seven cases of this kind of vision  which i term indifferently    sublimated       precocious    and    interior.
Green Tea,there is another class of affections which are truly termed   though commonly confounded with those which i describe   spectral illusions.
Green Tea,these latter i look upon as being no less simply curable than a cold in the head or a trifling dyspepsia.
Green Tea,it is those which rank in the first category that test our promptitude of thought.
Green Tea,fifty seven such cases have i encountered  neither more nor less.
Green Tea,and in how many of these have i failed  in no one single instance.
Green Tea,there is no one affliction of mortality more easily and certainly reducible  with a little patience  and a rational confidence in the physician.
Green Tea,with these simple conditions  i look upon the cure as absolutely certain.
Green Tea,you are to remember that i had not even commenced to treat mr. jennings    case.
Green Tea,i have not any doubt that i should have cured him perfectly in eighteen months  or possibly it might have extended to two years.
Green Tea,some cases are very rapidly curable  others extremely tedious.
Green Tea,every intelligent physician who will give thought and diligence to the task  will effect a cure.
Green Tea,you know my tract on the cardinal functions of the brain.
Green Tea,i there  by the evidence of innumerable facts  prove  as i think  the high probability of a circulation arterial and venous in its mechanism  through the nerves.
Green Tea,of this system  thus considered  the brain is the heart.
Green Tea,the fluid  which is propagated hence through one class of nerves  returns in an altered state through another  and the nature of that fluid is spiritual  though not immaterial  any more than  as i before remarked  light or electricity are so.
Green Tea,by various abuses  among which the habitual use of such agents as green tea is one  this fluid may be affected as to its quality  but it is more frequently disturbed as to equilibrium.
Green Tea,this fluid being that which we have in common with spirits  a congestion found upon the masses of brain or nerve  connected with the interior sense  forms a surface unduly exposed  on which disembodied spirits may operate  communication is thus more or less effectually established.
Green Tea,between this brain circulation and the heart circulation there is an intimate sympathy.
Green Tea,the seat  or rather the instrument of exterior vision  is the eye.
Green Tea,the seat of interior vision is the nervous tissue and brain  immediately about and above the eyebrow.
Green Tea,you remember how effectually i dissipated your pictures by the simple application of iced eau de cologne.
Green Tea,few cases  however  can be treated exactly alike with anything like rapid success.
Green Tea,cold acts powerfully as a repellant of the nervous fluid.
Green Tea,long enough continued it will even produce that permanent insensibility which we call numbness  and a little longer  muscular as well as sensational paralysis.
Green Tea,i have not  i repeat  the slightest doubt that i should have first dimmed and ultimately sealed that inner eye which mr. jennings had inadvertently opened.
Green Tea,the same senses are opened in delirium tremens  and entirely shut up again when the over action of the cerebral heart  and the prodigious nervous congestions that attend it  are terminated by a decided change in the state of the body.
Green Tea,it is by acting steadily upon the body  by a simple process  that this result is produced   and inevitably produced   i have never yet failed.
Green Tea,poor mr. jennings made away with himself.
Green Tea,but that catastrophe was the result of a totally different malady  which  as it were  projected itself upon that disease which was established.
Green Tea,his case was in the distinctive manner a complication  and the complaint under which he really succumbed  was hereditary suicidal mania.
Green Tea,poor mr. jennings i cannot call a patient of mine  for i had not even begun to treat his case  and he had not yet given me  i am convinced  his full and unreserved confidence.
Green Tea,if the patient do not array himself on the side of the disease  his cure is certain.
The Familiar,i was a young man at the time  and intimately acquainted with some of the actors in this strange tale  the impression which its incidents made on me  therefore  were deep  and lasting.
The Familiar,i shall now endeavour  with precision  to relate them all  combining  of course  in the narrative  whatever i have learned from various sources  tending  however imperfectly  to illuminate the darkness which involves its progress and termination.
The Familiar,somewhere about the year       the younger brother of a certain baronet  whom i shall call sir james barton  returned to dublin.
The Familiar,he had served in the navy with some distinction  having commanded one of his majesty   s frigates during the greater part of the american war.
The Familiar,captain barton was apparently some two or three and forty years of age.
The Familiar,he was an intelligent and agreeable companion when he pleased it  though generally reserved  and occasionally even moody.
The Familiar,in society  however  he deported himself as a man of the world  and a gentleman.
The Familiar,he had not contracted any of the noisy brusqueness sometimes acquired at sea  on the contrary  his manners were remarkably easy  quiet  and even polished.
The Familiar,he was in person about the middle size  and somewhat strongly formed   his countenance was marked with the lines of thought  and on the whole wore an expression of gravity and melancholy  being  however  as i have said  a man of perfect breeding  as well as of good family  and in affluent circumstances  he had  of course  ready access to the best society of dublin  without the necessity of any other credentials.
The Familiar,in his personal habits mr. barton was unexpensive.
The Familiar,he occupied lodgings in one of the then fashionable streets in the south side of the town   kept but one horse and one servant   and though a reputed free thinker  yet lived an orderly and moral life   indulging neither in gaming  drinking  nor any other vicious pursuit   living very much to himself  without forming intimacies  or choosing any companions  and appearing to mix in gay society rather for the sake of its bustle and distraction  than for any opportunities it offered of interchanging thought or feeling with its votaries.
The Familiar,barton was therefore pronounced a saving  prudent  unsocial sort of fellow  who bid fair to maintain his celibacy alike against stratagem and assault  and was likely to live to a good old age  die rich  and leave his money to an hospital.
The Familiar,it was now apparent  however  that the nature of mr. barton   s plans had been totally misconceived.
The Familiar,a young lady  whom i shall call miss montague  was at this time introduced into the gay world  by her aunt  the dowager lady l      .
The Familiar,miss montague was decidedly pretty and accomplished  and having some natural cleverness  and a great deal of gaiety  became for a while a reigning toast.
The Familiar,her popularity  however  gained her  for a time  nothing more than that unsubstantial admiration which  however  pleasant as an incense to vanity  is by no means necessarily antecedent to matrimony   for  unhappily for the young lady in question  it was an understood thing  that beyond her personal attractions  she had no kind of earthly provision.
The Familiar,such being the state of affairs  it will readily be believed that no little surprise was consequent upon the appearance of captain barton as the avowed lover of the penniless miss montague.
The Familiar,his suit prospered  as might have been expected  and in a short time it was communicated by old lady l       to each of her hundred and fifty particular friends in succession  that captain barton had actually tendered proposals of marriage  with her approbation  to her niece  miss montague  who had  moreover  accepted the offer of his hand  conditionally upon the consent of her father  who was then upon his homeward voyage from india  and expected in two or three weeks at the furthest.
The Familiar,about this consent there could be no doubt   the delay  therefore  was one merely of form   they were looked upon as absolutely engaged  and lady l        with a rigour of old fashioned decorum with which her niece would  no doubt  gladly have dispensed  withdrew her thenceforward from all further participation in the gaieties of the town.
The Familiar,captain barton was a constant visitor  as well as a frequent guest at the house  and was permitted all the privileges of intimacy which a betrothed suitor is usually accorded.
The Familiar,such was the relation of parties  when the mysterious circumstances which darken this narrative first begun to unfold themselves.
The Familiar,lady l       resided in a handsome mansion at the north side of dublin  and captain barton   s lodgings  as we have already said  were situated at the south.
The Familiar,the distance intervening was considerable  and it was captain barton   s habit generally to walk home without an attendant  as often as he passed the evening with the old lady and her fair charge.
The Familiar,his shortest way in such nocturnal walks  lay  for a considerable space  through a line of street which had as yet merely been laid out  and little more than the foundations of the houses constructed.
The Familiar,one night  shortly after his engagement with miss montague had commenced  he happened to remain unusually late  in company with her and lady l      .
The Familiar,the conversation had turned upon the evidences of revelation  which he had disputed with the callous scepticism of a confirmed infidel.
The Familiar,what were called    french principles    had in those days found their way a good deal into fashionable society  especially that portion of it which professed allegiance to whiggism  and neither the old lady nor her charge were so perfectly free from the taint  as to look upon mr. barton   s views as any serious objection to the proposed union.
The Familiar,the discussion had degenerated into one upon the supernatural and the marvellous  in which he had pursued precisely the same line of argument and ridicule.
The Familiar,in all this  it is but truth to state  captain barton  was guilty of no affectation   the doctrines upon which he insisted  were  in reality  but  too truly the basis of his own fixed belief  if so it might be called  and perhaps not the least strange of the many strange circumstances connected with my narrative  was the fact  that the subject of the fearful influences i am about to describe  was himself  from the deliberate conviction of years  an utter disbeliever in what are usually termed preternatural agencies.
The Familiar,it was considerably past midnight when mr. barton took his leave  and set out upon his solitary walk homeward.
The Familiar,he had now reached the lonely road  with its unfinished dwarf walls tracing the foundations of the projected row of houses on either side   the moon was shining mistily  and its imperfect light made the road he trod but additionally dreary   that utter silence which has in it something indefinably exciting  reigned there  and made the sound of his steps  which alone broke it  unnaturally loud and distinct.
The Familiar,he had proceeded thus some way  when he  on a sudden  heard other footfalls  pattering at a measured pace  and  as it seemed  about two score steps behind him.
The Familiar,the suspicion of being dogged is at all times unpleasant  it is  however  especially so in a spot so lonely  and this suspicion became so strong in the mind of captain barton  that he abruptly turned about to confront his pursuer  but  though there was quite sufficient moonlight to disclose any object upon the road he had traversed  no form of any kind was visible there.
The Familiar,the steps he had heard could not have been the reverberation of his own  for he stamped his foot upon the ground  and walked briskly up and down  in the vain attempt to awake an echo  though by no means a fanciful person  therefore he was at last fain to charge the sounds upon his imagination  and treat them as an illusion.
The Familiar,thus satisfying himself  he resumed his walk  and before he had proceeded a dozen paces  the mysterious footfall was again audible from behind  and this time  as if with the special design of showing that the sounds were not the responses of an echo   the steps sometimes slackened nearly to a halt  and sometimes hurried for six or eight strides to a run  and again abated to a walk.
The Familiar,captain barton  as before  turned suddenly round  and with the same result   no object was visible above the deserted level of the road.
The Familiar,he walked back over the same ground  determined that  whatever might have been the cause of the sounds which had so disconcerted him  it should not escape his search   the endeavour  however  was unrewarded.
The Familiar,in spite of all his scepticism  he felt something like a superstitious fear stealing fast upon him  and with these unwonted and uncomfortable sensations  he once more turned and pursued his way.
The Familiar,there was no repetition of these haunting sounds  until he had reached the point where he had last stopped to retrace his steps   here they were resumed   and with sudden starts of running  which threatened to bring the unseen pursuer up to the alarmed pedestrian.
The Familiar,captain barton arrested his course as formerly   the unaccountable nature of the occurrence filled him with vague and disagreeable sensations   and yielding to the excitement that was gaining upon him  he shouted sternly     who goes there    the sound of one   s own voice  thus exerted  in utter solitude  and followed by total silence  has in it something unpleasantly dismaying  and he felt a degree of nervousness which  perhaps  from no cause had he ever known before.
The Familiar,to the very end of this solitary street the steps pursued him   and it required a strong effort of stubborn pride on his part  to resist the impulse that prompted him every moment to run for safety at the top of his speed.
The Familiar,it was not until he had reached his lodging  and sate by his own fire side  that he felt sufficiently reassured to rearrange and reconsider in his own mind the occurrences which had so discomposed him.
The Familiar,so little a matter  after all  is sufficient to upset the pride of scepticism and vindicate the old simple laws of nature within us.
The Familiar,mr. barton was next morning sitting at a late breakfast  reflecting upon the incidents of the previous night  with more of inquisitiveness than awe  so speedily do gloomy impressions upon the fancy disappear under the cheerful influence of day  when a letter just delivered by the postman was placed upon the table before him.
The Familiar,there was nothing remarkable in the address of this missive  except that it was written in a hand which he did not know   perhaps it was disguised   for the tall narrow characters were sloped backward  and with the self inflicted suspense which we often see practised in such cases  he puzzled over the inscription for a full minute before he broke the seal.
The Familiar,when he did so  he read the following words  written in the same hand         mr. barton  late captain of the    dolphin     is warned of danger.
The Familiar,he will do wisely to avoid        street    here the locality of his last night   s adventure was named    if he walks there as usual he will meet with something unlucky   let him take warning  once for all  for he has reason to dread     the watcher.
The Familiar,captain barton read and re read this strange effusion  in every light and in every direction he turned it over and over  he examined the paper on which it was written  and scrutinized the hand writing once more.
The Familiar,defeated here  he turned to the seal  it was nothing but a patch of wax  upon which the accidental impression of a thumb was imperfectly visible.
The Familiar,there was not the slightest mark  or clue of any kind  to lead him to even a guess as to its possible origin.
The Familiar,the writer   s object seemed a friendly one  and yet he subscribed himself as one whom he had    reason to dread.
The Familiar,altogether the letter  its author  and its real purpose were to him an inexplicable puzzle  and one  moreover  unpleasantly suggestive  in his mind  of other associations connected with his last night   s adventure.
The Familiar,in obedience to some feeling   perhaps of pride   mr. barton did not communicate  even to his intended bride  the occurrences which i have just detailed.
The Familiar,trifling as they might appear  they had in reality most disagreeably affected his imagination  and he cared not to disclose  even to the young lady in question  what she might possibly look upon as evidences of weakness.
The Familiar,the letter might very well be but a hoax  and the mysterious footfall but a delusion or a trick.
The Familiar,but although he affected to treat the whole affair as unworthy of a thought  it yet haunted him pertinaciously  tormenting him with perplexing doubts  and depressing him with undefined apprehensions.
The Familiar,certain it is  that for a considerable time afterwards he carefully avoided the street indicated in the letter as the scene of danger.
The Familiar,it was not until about a week after the receipt of the letter which i have transcribed  that anything further occurred to remind captain barton of its contents  or to counteract the gradual disappearance from his mind of the disagreeable impressions then received.
The Familiar,he was returning one night  after the interval i have stated  from the theatre  which was then situated in crow street  and having there seen miss montague and lady l       into their carriage  he loitered for some time with two or three acquaintances.
The Familiar,with these  however  he parted close to the college  and pursued his way alone.
The Familiar,it was now fully one o   clock  and the streets were quite deserted.
The Familiar,during the whole of his walk with the companions from whom he had just parted  he had been at times painfully aware of the sound of steps  as it seemed  dogging them on their way.
The Familiar,once or twice he had looked back  in the uneasy anticipation that he was again about to experience the same mysterious annoyances which had so disconcerted him a week before  and earnestly hoping that he might see some form to account naturally for the sounds.
The Familiar,but the street was deserted   no one was visible.
The Familiar,proceeding now quite alone upon his homeward way  he grew really nervous and uncomfortable  as he became sensible  with increased distinctness  of the well known and now absolutely dreaded sounds.
The Familiar,by the side of the dead wall which bounded the college park  the sounds followed  recommencing almost simultaneously with his own steps.
The Familiar,the same unequal pace   sometimes slow  sometimes for a score yards or so  quickened almost to a run   was audible from behind him.
The Familiar,again and again he turned  quickly and stealthily he glanced over his shoulder   almost at every half dozen steps  but no one was visible.
The Familiar,the irritation of this intangible and unseen pursuit became gradually all but intolerable  and when at last he reached his home  his nerves were strung to such a pitch of excitement that he could not rest  and did not attempt even to lie down until after the daylight had broken.
The Familiar,he was awakened by a knock at his chamber door  and his servant entering  handed him several letters which had just been received by the penny post.
The Familiar,one among them instantly arrested his attention   a single glance at the direction aroused him thoroughly.
The Familiar,he at once recognized its character  and read as follows         you may as well think  captain barton  to escape from your own shadow as from me  do what you may  i will see you as often as i please  and you shall see me  for i do not want to hide myself  as you fancy.
The Familiar,do not let it trouble your rest  captain barton  for  with a good conscience  what need you fear from the eye of     the watcher.
The Familiar,it is scarcely necessary to dwell upon the feelings that accompanied a perusal of this strange communication.
The Familiar,captain barton was observed to be unusually absent and out of spirits for several days afterwards  but no one divined the cause.
The Familiar,whatever he might think as to the phantom steps which followed him  there could be no possible illusion about the letters he had received  and  to say the least  their immediate sequence upon the mysterious sounds which had haunted him  was an odd coincidence.
The Familiar,the whole circumstance was  in his own mind  vaguely and instinctively connected with certain passages in his past life  which  of all others  he hated to remember.
The Familiar,it happened  however  that in addition to his own approaching nuptials  captain barton had just then   fortunately  perhaps  for himself   some business of an engrossing kind connected with the adjustment of a large and long litigated claim upon certain properties.
The Familiar,the hurry and excitement of business had its natural effect in gradually dispelling the gloom which had for a time occasionally oppressed him  and in a little while his spirits had entirely recovered their accustomed tone.
The Familiar,during all this time  however  he was  now and then  dismayed by indistinct and half heard repetitions of the same annoyance  and that in lonely places  in the day time as well as after nightfall.
The Familiar,these renewals of the strange impressions from which he had suffered so much  were  however  desultory and faint  insomuch that often he really could not  to his own satisfaction  distinguish between them and the mere suggestions of an excited imagination.
The Familiar,one evening he walked down to the house of commons with a member  an acquaintance of his and mine.
The Familiar,this was one of the few occasions upon which i have been in company with captain barton.
The Familiar,as we walked down together  i observed that he became absent and silent  and to a degree that seemed to argue the pressure of some urgent and absorbing anxiety.
The Familiar,i afterwards learned that during the whole of our walk  he had heard the well known footsteps tracking him as we proceeded.
The Familiar,this  however  was the last time he suffered from this phase of the persecution  of which he was already the anxious victim.
The Familiar,a new and a very different one was about to be presented.
The Familiar,of the new series of impressions which were afterwards gradually to work out his destiny  i that evening witnessed the first  and but for its relation to the train of events which followed  the incident would scarcely have been now remembered by me.
The Familiar,as we were walking in at the passage from college green  a man  of whom i remember only that he was short in stature  looked like a foreigner  and wore a kind of fur travelling cap  walked very rapidly  and as if under fierce excitement  directly towards us  muttering to himself  fast and vehemently the while.
The Familiar,this odd looking person walked straight toward barton  who was foremost of the three  and halted  regarding him for a moment or two with a look of maniacal menace and fury  and then turning about as abruptly  he walked before us at the same agitated pace  and disappeared at a side passage.
The Familiar,i do distinctly remember being a good deal shocked at the countenance and bearing of this man  which indeed irresistibly impressed me with an undefined sense of danger  such as i have never felt before or since from the presence of anything human  but these sensations were  on my part  far from amounting to anything so disconcerting as to flurry or excite me   i had seen only a singularly evil countenance  agitated  as it seemed  with the excitement of madness.
The Familiar,i was absolutely astonished  however  at the effect of this apparition upon captain barton.
The Familiar,i knew him to be a man of proud courage and coolness in real danger   a circumstance which made his conduct upon this occasion the more conspicuously odd.
The Familiar,he recoiled a step or two as the stranger advanced  and clutched my arm in silence  with what seemed to be a spasm of agony or terror  and then  as the figure disappeared  shoving me roughly back  he followed it for a few paces  stopped in great disorder  and sat down upon a form.
The Familiar,i never beheld a countenance more ghastly and haggard.
The Familiar,for god   s sake  barton  what is the matter    said         our companion  really alarmed at his appearance.
The Familiar,you   re not hurt  are you    or unwell  what is it        what did he say    i did not hear it   what was it    asked barton  wholly disregarding the question.
The Familiar,nonsense    said         greatly surprised     who cares what the fellow said.
The Familiar,you are unwell  barton   decidedly unwell  let me call a coach.
The Familiar,unwell  no   not unwell    he said  evidently making an effort to recover his self possession     but  to say the truth  i am fatigued   a little over worked   and perhaps over anxious.
The Familiar,you know i have been in chancery  and the winding up of a suit is always a nervous affair.
The Familiar,i have felt uncomfortable all this evening  but i am better now.
The Familiar,come  come   shall we go on        no  no.
The Familiar,take my advice  barton  and go home  you really do need rest  you are looking quite ill.
The Familiar,i really do insist on your allowing me to see you home    replied his friend.
The Familiar,i seconded          s advice  the more readily as it was obvious that barton was not himself disinclined to be persuaded.
The Familiar,he left us  declining our offered escort.
The Familiar,i was not sufficiently intimate with        to discuss the scene we had both just witnessed.
The Familiar,i was  however  convinced from his manner in the few common place comments and regrets we exchanged  that he was just as little satisfied as i with the extempore plea of illness with which he had accounted for the strange exhibition  and that we were both agreed in suspecting some lurking mystery in the matter.
The Familiar,i called next day at barton   s lodgings  to enquire for him  and learned from the servant that he had not left his room since his return the night before  but that he was not seriously indisposed  and hoped to be out in a few days.
The Familiar,that evening he sent for dr. r        then in large and fashionable practice in dublin  and their interview was  it is said  an odd one.
The Familiar,he entered into a detail of his own symptoms in an abstracted and desultory way which seemed to argue a strange want of interest in his own cure  and  at all events  made it manifest that there was some topic engaging his mind of more engrossing importance than his present ailment.
The Familiar,he complained of occasional palpitations and headache.
The Familiar,doctor r        asked him among other questions  whether there was any irritating circumstance or anxiety then occupying his thoughts.
The Familiar,this he denied quickly and almost peevishly  and the physician thereupon declared his opinion  that there was nothing amiss except some slight derangement of the digestion  for which he accordingly wrote a prescription  and was about to withdraw  when mr. barton  with the air of a man who recollects a topic which had nearly escaped him  recalled him.
The Familiar,i beg your pardon  doctor  but i really almost forgot  will you permit me to ask you two or three medical questions   rather odd ones  perhaps  but a wager depends upon their solution  you will  i hope  excuse my unreasonableness.
The Familiar,the physician readily undertook to satisfy the inquirer.
The Familiar,barton seemed to have some difficulty about opening the proposed interrogatories  for he was silent for a minute  then walked to his book case  and returned as he had gone  at last he sat down and said        you   ll think them very childish questions  but i can   t recover my wager without a decision  so i must put them.
The Familiar,i want to know first about lock jaw.
The Familiar,if a man actually has had that complaint  and appears to have died of it   so much so  that a physician of average skill pronounces him actually dead   may he  after all  recover     the physician smiled  and shook his head.
The Familiar,but   but a blunder may be made    resumed barton.
The Familiar,suppose an ignorant pretender to medical skill  may he be so deceived by any stage of the complaint  as to mistake what is only a part of the progress of the disease  for death itself        no one who had ever seen death    answered he     could mistake it in a case of lock jaw.
The Familiar,barton mused for a few minutes.
The Familiar,i am going to ask you a question  perhaps  still more childish  but first  tell me  are the regulations of foreign hospitals  such as that of  let us say  naples  very lax and bungling.
The Familiar,may not all kinds of blunders and slips occur in their entries of names  and soforth     doctor r       professed his incompetence to answer that query.
The Familiar,well  then  doctor  here is the last of my questions.
The Familiar,you will  probably  laugh at it  but it must out  nevertheless.
The Familiar,is there any disease  in all the range of human maladies  which would have the effect of perceptibly contracting the stature  and the whole frame   causing the man to shrink in all his proportions  and yet to preserve his exact resemblance to himself in every particular   with the one exception  his height and bulk  any disease  mark   no matter how rare   how little believed in  generally   which could possibly result in producing such an effect     the physician replied with a smile  and a very decided negative.
The Familiar,tell me  then    said barton  abruptly     if a man be in reasonable fear of assault from a lunatic who is at large  can he not procure a warrant for his arrest and detention        really that is more a lawyer   s question than one in my way    replied dr. r           but i believe  on applying to a magistrate  such a course would be directed.
The Familiar,the physician then took his leave  but  just as he reached the hall door  remembered that he had left his cane up stairs  and returned.
The Familiar,his reappearance was awkward  for a piece of paper  which he recognised as his own prescription  was slowly burning upon the fire  and barton sitting close by with an expression of settled gloom and dismay.
The Familiar,doctor r       had too much tact to observe what presented itself  but he had seen quite enough to assure him that the mind  and not the body  of captain barton was in reality the seat of suffering.
The Familiar,a few days afterwards  the following advertisement appeared in the dublin newspapers.
The Familiar,if sylvester yelland  formerly a foremast man on board his majesty   s frigate dolphin  or his nearest of kin  will apply to mr. hubert smith  attorney  at his office  dame street  he or they may hear of something greatly to his or their advantage.
The Familiar,admission may be had at any hour up to twelve o   clock at night  should parties desire to avoid observation  and the strictest secrecy  as to all communications intended to be confidential  shall be honourably observed.
The Familiar,the dolphin  as i have mentioned  was the vessel which captain barton had commanded  and this circumstance  connected with the extraordinary exertions made by the circulation of hand bills   c.  as well as by repeated advertisements  to secure for this strange notice the utmost possible publicity  suggested to dr. r       the idea that captain barton   s extreme uneasiness was somehow connected with the individual to whom the advertisement was addressed  and he himself the author of it.
The Familiar,this  however  it is needless to add  was no more than a conjecture.
The Familiar,no information whatsoever  as to the real purpose of the advertisement was divulged by the agent  nor yet any hint as to who his employer might be.
The Familiar,mr. barton  although he had latterly begun to earn for himself the character of an hypochondriac  was yet very far from deserving it.
The Familiar,though by no means lively  he had yet  naturally  what are termed    even spirits    and was not subject to undue depressions.
The Familiar,he soon  therefore  began to return to his former habits  and one of the earliest symptoms of this healthier tone of spirits was  his appearing at a grand dinner of the freemasons  of which worthy fraternity he was himself a brother.
The Familiar,barton  who had been at first gloomy and abstracted  drank much more freely than was his wont   possibly with the purpose of dispelling his own secret anxieties   and under the influence of good wine  and pleasant company  became gradually  unlike himself  talkative  and even noisy.
The Familiar,it was under this unwonted excitement that he left his company at about half past ten o   clock  and  as conviviality is a strong incentive to gallantry  it occurred to him to proceed forthwith to lady l         s and pass the remainder of the evening with her and his destined bride.
The Familiar,accordingly  he was soon at        street  and chatting gaily with the ladies.
The Familiar,it is not to be supposed that captain barton had exceeded the limits which propriety prescribes to good fellowship   he had merely taken enough wine to raise his spirits  without  however  in the least degree unsteadying his mind  or affecting his manners.
The Familiar,with this undue elevation of spirits had supervened an entire oblivion or contempt of those undefined apprehensions which had for so long weighed upon his mind  and to a certain extent estranged him from society  but as the night wore away  and his artificial gaiety began to flag  these painful feelings gradually intruded themselves again  and he grew abstracted and anxious as heretofore.
The Familiar,he took his leave at length  with an unpleasant foreboding of some coming mischief  and with a mind haunted with a thousand mysterious apprehensions  such as  even while he acutely felt their pressure  he  nevertheless  inwardly strove  or affected to contemn.
The Familiar,it was this proud defiance of what he regarded as his own weakness  which prompted him upon the present occasion to that course which brought about the adventure i am now about to relate.
The Familiar,mr. barton might have easily called a coach  but he was conscious that his strong inclination to do so proceeded from no cause other than what he desperately persisted in representing to himself to be his own superstitious tremors.
The Familiar,he might also have returned home by a route different from that against which he had been warned by his mysterious correspondent  but for the same reason he dismissed this idea also  and with a dogged and half desperate resolution to force matters to a crisis of some kind  if there were any reality in the causes of his former suffering  and if not  satisfactorily to bring their delusiveness to the proof  he determined to follow precisely the course which he had trodden upon the night so painfully memorable in his own mind as that on which his strange persecution commenced.
The Familiar,though  sooth to say  the pilot who for the first time steers his vessel under the muzzles of a hostile battery  never felt his resolution more severely tasked than did captain barton as he breathlessly pursued this solitary path   a path which  spite of every effort of scepticism and reason  he felt to be infested by some  as respected him  malignant being.
The Familiar,he pursued his way steadily and rapidly  scarcely breathing from intensity of suspense  he  however  was troubled by no renewal of the dreaded footsteps  and was beginning to feel a return of confidence  as more than three fourths of the way being accomplished with impunity  he approached the long line of twinkling oil lamps which indicated the frequented streets.
The Familiar,this feeling of self congratulation was  however  but momentary.
The Familiar,the report of a musket at some hundred yards behind him  and the whistle of a bullet close to his head  disagreeably and startlingly dispelled it.
The Familiar,his first impulse was to retrace his steps in pursuit of the assassin  but the road on either side was  as we have said  embarrassed by the foundations of a street  beyond which extended waste fields  full of rubbish and neglected lime and brick kilns  and all now as utterly silent as though no sound had ever disturbed their dark and unsightly solitude.
The Familiar,the futility of  single handed  attempting  under such circumstances  a search for the murderer  was apparent  especially as no sound  either of retreating steps or any other kind  was audible to direct his pursuit.
The Familiar,with the tumultuous sensations of one whose life has just been exposed to a murderous attempt  and whose escape has been the narrowest possible  captain barton turned again  and without  however  quickening his pace actually to a run  hurriedly pursued his way.
The Familiar,he had turned  as i have said  after a pause of a few seconds  and had just commenced his rapid retreat  when on a sudden he met the well remembered little man in the fur cap.
The Familiar,the encounter was but momentary.
The Familiar,the figure was walking at the same exaggerated pace  and with the same strange air of menace as before  and as it passed him  he thought he heard it say  in a furious whisper     still alive   still alive     the state of mr. barton   s spirits began now to work a corresponding alteration in his health and looks  and to such a degree that it was impossible that the change should escape general remark.
The Familiar,for some reasons  known but to himself  he took no step whatsoever to bring the attempt upon his life  which he had so narrowly escaped  under the notice of the authorities  on the contrary  he kept it jealously to himself  and it was not for many weeks after the occurrence that he mentioned it  and then in strict confidence  to a gentleman  whom the torments of his mind at last compelled him to consult.
The Familiar,spite of his blue devils  however  poor barton  having no satisfactory reason to render to the public for any undue remissness in the attentions exacted by the relation subsisting between him and miss montague was obliged to exert himself  and present to the world a confident and cheerful bearing.
The Familiar,the true source of his sufferings  and every circumstance connected with them  he guarded with a reserve so jealous  that it seemed dictated by at least a suspicion that the origin of his strange persecution was known to himself  and that it was of a nature which  upon his own account  he could not or dared not disclose.
The Familiar,the mind thus turned in upon itself  and constantly occupied with a haunting anxiety which it dared not reveal or confide to any human breast  became daily more excited  and  of course  more vividly impressible  by a system of attack which operated through the nervous system  and in this state he was destined to sustain  with increasing frequency  the stealthy visitations of that apparition which from the first had seemed to possess so terrible a hold upon his imagination.
The Familiar,it was about this time that captain barton called upon the then celebrated preacher  dr.         with whom he had a slight acquaintance  and an extraordinary conversation ensued.
The Familiar,the divine was seated in his chambers in college  surrounded with works upon his favourite pursuit  and deep in theology  when barton was announced.
The Familiar,there was something at once embarrassed and excited in his manner  which  along with his wan and haggard countenance  impressed the student with the unpleasant consciousness that his visitor must have recently suffered terribly indeed  to account for an alteration so striking   almost shocking.
The Familiar,after the usual interchange of polite greeting  and a few common place remarks  captain barton  who obviously perceived the surprise which his visit had excited  and which doctor        was unable wholly to conceal  interrupted a brief pause by remarking        this is a strange call  doctor         perhaps scarcely warranted by an acquaintance so slight as mine with you.
The Familiar,i should not under ordinary circumstances have ventured to disturb you  but my visit is neither an idle nor impertinent intrusion.
The Familiar,i am sure you will not so account it  when i tell you how afflicted i am.
The Familiar,doctor        interrupted him with assurances such as good breeding suggested  and barton resumed        i am come to task your patience by asking your advice.
The Familiar,when i say your patience  i might  indeed  say more  i might have said your humanity   your compassion  for i have been and am a great sufferer.
The Familiar,my dear sir    replied the churchman     it will  indeed  afford me infinite gratification if i can give you comfort in any distress of mind  but   you know             i know what you would say    resumed barton  quickly     i am an unbeliever  and  therefore  incapable of deriving help from religion  but don   t take that for granted.
The Familiar,at least you must not assume that  however unsettled my convictions may be  i do not feel a deep   a very deep   interest in the subject.
The Familiar,circumstances have lately forced it upon my attention  in such a way as to compel me to review the whole question in a more candid and teachable spirit  i believe  than i ever studied it in before.
The Familiar,your difficulties  i take it for granted  refer to the evidences of revelation    suggested the clergyman.
The Familiar,why   no   not altogether  in fact i am ashamed to say i have not considered even my objections sufficiently to state them connectedly  but   but there is one subject on which i feel a peculiar interest.
The Familiar,he paused again  and doctor        pressed him to proceed.
The Familiar,the fact is    said barton     whatever may be my uncertainty as to the authenticity of what we are taught to call revelation  of one fact i am deeply and horribly convinced  that there does exist beyond this a spiritual world   a system whose workings are generally in mercy hidden from us   a system which may be  and which is sometimes  partially and terribly revealed.
The Familiar,i am sure   i know    continued barton  with increasing excitement     that there is a god   a dreadful god   and that retribution follows guilt  in ways the most mysterious and stupendous   by agencies the most inexplicable and terrific    there is a spiritual system   great god  how i have been convinced    a system malignant  and implacable  and omnipotent  under whose persecutions i am  and have been  suffering the torments of the damned    yes  sir   yes   the fires and frenzy of hell     as barton spoke  his agitation became so vehement that the divine was shocked  and even alarmed.
The Familiar,the wild and excited rapidity with which he spoke  and  above all  the indefinable horror  that stamped his features  afforded a contrast to his ordinary cool and unimpassioned self possession striking and painful in the last degree.
The Familiar,my dear sir    said doctor         after a brief pause     i fear you have been very unhappy  indeed  but i venture to predict that the depression under which you labour will be found to originate in purely physical causes  and that with a change of air  and the aid of a few tonics  your spirits will return  and the tone of your mind be once more cheerful and tranquil as heretofore.
The Familiar,there was  after all  more truth than we are quite willing to admit in the classic theories which assigned the undue predominance of any one affection of the mind  to the undue action or torpidity of one or other of our bodily organs.
The Familiar,believe me  that a little attention to diet  exercise  and the other essentials of health  under competent direction  will make you as much yourself as you can wish.
The Familiar,doctor          said barton  with something like a shudder     i cannot delude myself with such a hope.
The Familiar,i have no hope to cling to but one  and that is  that by some other spiritual agency more potent than that which tortures me  it may be combated  and i delivered.
The Familiar,if this may not be  i am lost   now and for ever lost.
The Familiar,but  mr. barton  you must remember    urged his companion     that others have suffered as you have done  and             no  no  no    interrupted he  with irritability      no  sir  i am not a credulous   far from a superstitious man.
The Familiar,i have been  perhaps  too much the reverse   too sceptical  too slow of belief  but unless i were one whom no amount of evidence could convince  unless i were to contemn the repeated  the perpetual evidence of my own senses  i am now   now at last constrained to believe   i have no escape from the conviction   the overwhelming certainty   that i am haunted and dogged  go where i may  by   by a demon     there was a preternatural energy of horror in barton   s face  as  with its damp and death like lineaments turned towards his companion  he thus delivered himself.
The Familiar,god help you  my poor friend    said dr.         much shocked     god help you  for  indeed  you are a sufferer  however your sufferings may have been caused.
The Familiar,ay  ay  god help me    echoed barton  sternly     but will he help me   will he help me        pray to him   pray in an humble and trusting spirit    said he.
The Familiar,pray  pray    echoed he again     i can   t pray   i could as easily move a mountain by an effort of my will.
The Familiar,i have not belief enough to pray  there is something within me that will not pray.
The Familiar,you prescribe impossibilities   literal impossibilities.
The Familiar,you will not find it so  if you will but try    said doctor       .
The Familiar,try  i have tried  and the attempt only fills me with confusion  and  sometimes  terror  i have tried in vain  and more than in vain.
The Familiar,the awful  unutterable idea of eternity and infinity oppresses and maddens my brain whenever my mind approaches the contemplation of the creator  i recoil from the effort scared.
The Familiar,i tell you  doctor         if i am to be saved  it must be by other means.
The Familiar,the idea of an eternal creator is to me intolerable   my mind cannot support it.
The Familiar,say  then  my dear sir    urged he     say how you would have me serve you   what you would learn of me   what i can do or say to relieve you        listen to me first    replied captain barton  with a subdued air  and an effort to suppress his excitement     listen to me while i detail the circumstances of the persecution under which my life has become all but intolerable   a persecution which has made me fear death and the world beyond the grave as much as i have grown to hate existence.
The Familiar,barton then proceeded to relate the circumstances which i have already detailed  and then continued      this has now become habitual   an accustomed thing.
The Familiar,i do not mean the actual seeing him in the flesh   thank god  that at least is not permitted daily.
The Familiar,thank god  from the ineffable horrors of that visitation i have been mercifully allowed intervals of repose  though none of security  but from the consciousness that a malignant spirit is following and watching me wherever i go  i have never  for a single instant  a temporary respite.
The Familiar,i am pursued with blasphemies  cries of despair and appalling hatred.
The Familiar,i hear those dreadful sounds called after me as i turn the corners of the streets  they come in the night time  while i sit in my chamber alone  they haunt me everywhere  charging me with hideous crimes  and   great god    threatening me with coming vengeance and eternal misery.
The Familiar,hush  do you hear that    he cried with a horrible smile of triumph     there  there  will that convince you     the clergyman felt a chill of horror steal over him  while  during the wail of a sudden gust of wind  he heard  or fancied he heard  the half articulate sounds of rage and derision mingling in the sough.
The Familiar,well  what do you think of that    at length barton cried  drawing a long breath through his teeth.
The Familiar,i heard the wind    said doctor       .
The Familiar,what should i think of it   what is there remarkable about it        the prince of the powers of the air    muttered barton  with a shudder.
The Familiar,tut  tut  my dear sir    said the student  with an effort to reassure himself  for though it was broad daylight  there was nevertheless something disagreeably contagious in the nervous excitement under which his visitor so miserably suffered.
The Familiar,you must not give way to those wild fancies  you must resist these impulses of the imagination.
The Familiar,ay  ay     resist the devil and he will flee from thee       said barton  in the same tone     but how resist him  ay  there it is   there is the rub.
The Familiar,what   what am i to do  what can i do        my dear sir  this is fancy    said the man of folios     you are your own tormentor.
The Familiar,no  no  sir   fancy has no part in it    answered barton  somewhat sternly.
The Familiar,fancy  was it that made you  as well as me  hear  but this moment  those accents of hell  fancy  indeed  no  no.
The Familiar,but you have seen this person frequently    said the ecclesiastic     why have you not accosted or secured him  is it not a little precipitate  to say no more  to assume  as you have done  the existence of preternatural agency  when  after all  everything may be easily accountable  if only proper means were taken to sift the matter.
The Familiar,there are circumstances connected with this   this appearance    said barton     which it is needless to disclose  but which to me are proof of its horrible nature.
The Familiar,i know that the being that follows me is not human   i say i know this  i could prove it to your own conviction.
The Familiar,he paused for a minute  and then added     and as to accosting it  i dare not  i could not  when i see it i am powerless  i stand in the gaze of death  in the triumphant presence of infernal power and malignity.
The Familiar,my strength  and faculties  and memory  all forsake me.
The Familiar,o god  i fear  sir  you know not what you speak of.
The Familiar,mercy  mercy  heaven have pity on me     he leaned his elbow on the table  and passed his hand across his eyes  as if to exclude some image of horror  muttering the last words of the sentence he had just concluded  again and again.
The Familiar,doctor           he said  abruptly raising himself  and looking full upon the clergyman with an imploring eye     i know you will do for me whatever may be done.
The Familiar,you know now fully the circumstances and the nature of my affliction.
The Familiar,i tell you i cannot help myself  i cannot hope to escape  i am utterly passive.
The Familiar,i conjure you  then  to weigh my case well  and if anything may be done for me by vicarious supplication   by the intercession of the good   or by any aid or influence whatsoever  i implore of you  i adjure you in the name of the most high  give me the benefit of that influence   deliver me from the body of this death.
The Familiar,strive for me  pity me  i know you will  you cannot refuse this  it is the purpose and object of my visit.
The Familiar,send me away with some hope  however little  some faint hope of ultimate deliverance  and i will nerve myself to endure  from hour to hour  the hideous dream into which my existence has been transformed.
The Familiar,doctor        assured him that all he could do was to pray earnestly for him  and that so much he would not fail to do.
The Familiar,they parted with a hurried and melancholy valediction.
The Familiar,barton hastened to the carriage that awaited him at the door  drew down the blinds  and drove away  while doctor        returned to his chamber  to ruminate at leisure upon the strange interview which had just interrupted his studies.
The Familiar,it was not to be expected that captain barton   s changed and eccentric habits should long escape remark and discussion.
The Familiar,various were the theories suggested to account for it.
The Familiar,some attributed the alteration to the pressure of secret pecuniary embarrassments  others to a repugnance to fulfil an engagement into which he was presumed to have too precipitately entered  and others  again  to the supposed incipiency of mental disease  which latter  indeed  was the most plausible as well as the most generally  received  of the hypotheses circulated in the gossip of the day.
The Familiar,from the very commencement of this change  at first so gradual in its advances  miss montague had of course been aware of it.
The Familiar,the intimacy involved in their peculiar relation  as well as the near interest which it inspired afforded  in her case  a like opportunity and motive for the successful exercise of that keen and penetrating observation peculiar to her sex.
The Familiar,his visits became  at length  so interrupted  and his manner  while they lasted  so abstracted  strange  and agitated  that lady l        after hinting her anxiety and her suspicions more than once  at length distinctly stated her anxiety  and pressed for an explanation.
The Familiar,the explanation was given  and although its nature at first relieved the worst solicitudes of the old lady and her niece  yet the circumstances which attended it  and the really dreadful consequences which it obviously indicated  as regarded the spirits  and indeed the reason of the now wretched man  who made the strange declaration  were enough  upon little reflection  to fill their minds with perturbation and alarm.
The Familiar,general montague  the young lady   s father  at length arrived.
The Familiar,he had himself slightly known barton  some ten or twelve years previously  and being aware of his fortune and connexions  was disposed to regard him as an unexceptionable and indeed a most desirable match for his daughter.
The Familiar,he laughed at the story of barton   s supernatural visitations  and lost no time in calling upon his intended son in law.
The Familiar,my dear barton    he continued  gaily  after a little conversation     my sister tells me that you are a victim to blue devils  in quite a new and original shape.
The Familiar,barton changed countenance  and sighed profoundly.
The Familiar,come  come  i protest this will never do    continued the general     you are more like a man on his way to the gallows than to the altar.
The Familiar,these devils have made quite a saint of you.
The Familiar,barton made an effort to change the conversation.
The Familiar,no  no  it won   t do    said his visitor laughing     i am resolved to say what i have to say upon this magnificent mock mystery of yours.
The Familiar,you must not be angry  but really it is too bad to see you at your time of life  absolutely frightened into good behaviour  like a naughty child by a bugaboo  and as far as i can learn  a very contemptible one.
The Familiar,seriously  i have been a good deal annoyed at what they tell me  but at the same time thoroughly convinced that there is nothing in the matter that may not cleared up  with a little attention and management  within a week at furthest.
The Familiar,ah  general  you do not know      he began.
The Familiar,yes  but i do know quite enough to warrant my confidence    interrupted the soldier     don   t i know that all your annoyance proceeds from the occasional appearance of a certain little man in a cap and great coat  with a red vest and a bad face  who follows you about  and pops upon you at corners of lanes  and throws you into ague fits.
The Familiar,now  my dear fellow  i   ll make it my business to catch this mischievous little mountebank  and either beat him to a jelly with my own hands  or have him whipped through the town  at the cart   s tail  before a month passes.
The Familiar,if you knew what i knew    said barton  with gloomy agitation     you would speak very differently.
The Familiar,don   t imagine that i am so weak as to assume  without proof the most overwhelming  the conclusion to which i have been forced   the proofs are here  locked up here.
The Familiar,as he spoke he tapped upon his breast  and with an anxious sigh continued to walk up and down the room.
The Familiar,well  well  barton    said his visitor     i   ll wager a rump and a dozen i collar the ghost  and convince even you before many days are over.
The Familiar,he was running on in the same strain when he was suddenly arrested  and not a little shocked  by observing barton  who had approached the window  stagger slowly back  like one who had received a stunning blow  his arm extended toward the street   his face and his very lips white as ashes   while he muttered     there   by heaven    there   there     general montague started mechanically to his feet  and from the window of the drawing room  saw a figure corresponding as well as his hurry would permit him to discern  with the description of the person  whose appearance so persistently disturbed the repose of his friend.
The Familiar,the figure was just turning from the rails of the area upon which it had been leaning  and  without waiting to see more  the old gentleman snatched his cane and hat  and rushed down the stairs and into the street  in the furious hope of securing the person  and punishing the audacity of the mysterious stranger.
The Familiar,he looked round him  but in vain  for any trace of the person he had himself distinctly seen.
The Familiar,he ran breathlessly to the nearest corner  expecting to see from thence the retiring figure  but no such form was visible.
The Familiar,back and forward  from crossing to crossing  he ran  at fault  and it was not until the curious gaze and laughing countenances of the passers by reminded him of the absurdity of his pursuit  that he checked his hurried pace  lowered his walking cane from the menacing altitude which he had mechanically given it  adjusted his hat  and walked composedly back again  inwardly vexed and flurried.
The Familiar,he found barton pale and trembling in every joint  they both remained silent  though under emotions very different.
The Familiar,at last barton whispered     you saw it        it    him   some one   you mean   to be sure i did    replied montague  testily.
The Familiar,but where is the good or the harm of seeing him  the fellow runs like a lamp lighter.
The Familiar,i wanted to catch him  but he had stole away before i could reach the hall door.
The Familiar,however  it is no great matter  next time  i dare say  i   ll do better  and egad  if i once come within reach of him  i   ll introduce his shoulders to the weight of my cane.
The Familiar,notwithstanding general montague   s undertakings and exhortations  however  barton continued to suffer from the self same unexplained cause  go how  when  or where he would  he was still constantly dogged or confronted by the being who had established over him so horrible an influence.
The Familiar,nowhere and at no time was he secure against the odious appearance which haunted him with such diabolic perseverance.
The Familiar,his depression  misery  and excitement became more settled and alarming every day  and the mental agonies that ceaselessly preyed upon him  began at last so sensibly to affect his health  that lady l       and general montague succeeded  without  indeed  much difficulty  in persuading him to try a short tour on the continent  in the hope that an entire change of scene would  at all events  have the effect of breaking through the influences of local association  which the more sceptical of his friends assumed to be by no means inoperative in suggesting and perpetuating what they conceived to be a mere form of nervous illusion.
The Familiar,general montague indeed was persuaded that the figure which haunted his intended son in law was by no means the creation of his imagination  but  on the contrary  a substantial form of flesh and blood  animated by a resolution  perhaps with some murderous object in perspective  to watch and follow the unfortunate gentleman.
The Familiar,even this hypothesis was not a very pleasant one  yet it was plain that if barton could ever be convinced that there was nothing preternatural in the phenomenon which he had hitherto regarded in that light  the affair would lose all its terrors in his eyes  and wholly cease to exercise upon his health and spirits the baleful influence which it had hitherto done.
The Familiar,he therefore reasoned  that if the annoyance were actually escaped by mere locomotion and change of scene  it obviously could not have originated in any supernatural agency.
The Familiar,yielding to their persuasions  barton left dublin for england  accompanied by general montague.
The Familiar,they posted rapidly to london  and thence to dover  whence they took the packet with a fair wind for calais.
The Familiar,the general   s confidence in the result of the expedition on barton   s spirits had risen day by day  since their departure from the shores of ireland  for to the inexpressible relief and delight of the latter  he had not since then  so much as even once fancied a repetition of those impressions which had  when at home  drawn him gradually down to the very depths of despair.
The Familiar,this exemption from what he had begun to regard as the inevitable condition of his existence  and the sense of security which began to pervade his mind  were inexpressibly delightful  and in the exultation of what he considered his deliverance  he indulged in a thousand happy anticipations for a future into which so lately he had hardly dared to look  and in short  both he and his companion secretly congratulated themselves upon the termination of that persecution which had been to its immediate victim a source of such unspeakable agony.
The Familiar,it was a beautiful day  and a crowd of idlers stood upon the jetty to receive the packet  and enjoy the bustle of the new arrivals.
The Familiar,montague walked a few paces in advance of his friend  and as he made his way through the crowd  a little man touched his arm  and said to him  in a broad provincial patois        monsieur is walking too fast  he will lose his sick comrade in the throng  for  by my faith  the poor gentleman seems to be fainting.
The Familiar,montague turned quickly  and observed that barton did indeed look deadly pale.
The Familiar,he hastened to his side.
The Familiar,my dear fellow  are you ill    he asked anxiously.
The Familiar,the question was unheeded and twice  repeated  ere barton stammered        i saw him   by        i saw him        him    the wretch   who   where now    where is he    cried montague  looking around him.
The Familiar,i saw him   but he is gone    repeated barton  faintly.
The Familiar,but where   where  for god   s sake speak    urged montague  vehemently.
The Familiar,it is but this moment   here    said he.
The Familiar,but what did he look like   what had he on   what did he wear   quick  quick    urged his excited companion  ready to dart among the crowd and collar the delinquent on the spot.
The Familiar,he touched your arm   he spoke to you   he pointed to me.
The Familiar,god be merciful to me  there is no escape    said barton  in the low  subdued tones of despair.
The Familiar,montague had already bustled away in all the flurry of mingled hope and rage  but though the singular personnel of the stranger who had accosted him was vividly impressed upon his recollection  he failed to discover among the crowd even the slightest resemblance to him.
The Familiar,after a fruitless search  in which he enlisted the services of several of the by standers  who aided all the more zealously  as they believed he had been robbed  he at length  out of breath and baffled  gave over the attempt.
The Familiar,ah  my friend  it won   t do    said barton  with the faint voice and bewildered  ghastly look of one who had been stunned by some mortal shock     there is no use in contending  whatever it is  the dreadful association between me and it  is now established   i shall never escape   never        nonsense  nonsense  my dear barton  don   t talk so    said montague with something at once of irritation and dismay     you must not  i say  we   ll jockey the scoundrel yet  never mind  i say   never mind.
The Familiar,it was  however  but labour lost to endeavour henceforward to inspire barton with one ray of hope  he became desponding.
The Familiar,this intangible  and  as it seemed  utterly inadequate influence was fast destroying his energies of intellect  character  and health.
The Familiar,his first object was now to return to ireland  there  as he believed  and now almost hoped  speedily to die.
The Familiar,to ireland accordingly he came and one of the first faces he saw upon the shore  was again that of his implacable and dreaded attendant.
The Familiar,barton seemed at last to have lost not only all enjoyment and every hope in existence  but all independence of will besides.
The Familiar,he now submitted himself passively to the management of the friends most nearly interested in his welfare.
The Familiar,with the apathy of entire despair  he implicitly assented to whatever measures they suggested and advised  and as a last resource  it was determined to remove him to a house of lady l         s  in the neighbourhood of clontarf  where  with the advice of his medical attendant  who persisted in his opinion that the whole train of consequences resulted merely from some nervous derangement  it was resolved that he was to confine himself  strictly to the house  and to make use only of those apartments which commanded a view of an enclosed yard  the gates of which were to be kept jealously locked.
The Familiar,those precautions would certainly secure him against the casual appearance of any living form  that his excited imagination might possibly confound with the spectre which  as it was contended  his fancy recognised in every figure that bore even a distant or general resemblance to the peculiarities with which his fancy had at first invested it.
The Familiar,a month or six weeks    absolute seclusion under these conditions  it was hoped might  by interrupting the series of these terrible impressions  gradually dispel the predisposing apprehensions  and the associations which had confirmed the supposed disease  and rendered recovery hopeless.
The Familiar,cheerful society and that of his friends was to be constantly supplied  and on the whole  very sanguine expectations were indulged in  that under the treatment thus detailed  the obstinate hypochondria of the patient might at length give way.
The Familiar,accompanied  therefore  by lady l        general montague and his daughter   his own affianced bride   poor barton   himself never daring to cherish a hope of his ultimate emancipation from the horrors under which his life was literally wasting away   took possession of the apartments  whose situation protected him against the intrusions  from which he shrank with such unutterable terror.
The Familiar,after a little time  a steady persistence in this system began to manifest its results  in a very marked though gradual improvement  alike in the health and spirits of the invalid.
The Familiar,not  indeed  that anything at all approaching complete recovery was yet discernible.
The Familiar,on the contrary  to those who had not seen him since the commencement of his strange sufferings  such an alteration would have been apparent as might well have shocked them.
The Familiar,the improvement  however  such as it was  was welcomed with gratitude and delight  especially by the young lady  whom her attachment to him  as well as her now singularly painful position  consequent on his protracted illness  rendered an object scarcely one degree less to be commiserated than himself.
The Familiar,a week passed   a fortnight   a month   and yet there had been no recurrence of the hated visitation.
The Familiar,the treatment had  so far forth  been followed by complete success.
The Familiar,the chain of associations was broken.
The Familiar,the constant pressure upon the overtasked spirits had been removed  and  under these comparatively favourable circumstances  the sense of social community with the world about him  and something of human interest  if not of enjoyment  began to reanimate him.
The Familiar,it was about this time that lady l       who  like most old ladies of the day  was deep in family receipts  and a great pretender to medical science  dispatched her own maid to the kitchen garden  with a list of herbs  which were there to be carefully culled  and brought back to her housekeeper for the purpose stated.
The Familiar,the handmaiden  however  returned with her task scarce half completed  and a good deal flurried and alarmed.
The Familiar,her mode of accounting for her precipitate retreat and evident agitation was odd  and  to the old lady  startling.
The Familiar,it appeared that she had repaired to the kitchen garden  pursuant to her mistress   s directions  and had there begun to make the specified election among the rank and neglected herbs which crowded one corner of the enclosure  and while engaged in this pleasant labour  she carelessly sang a fragment of an old song  as she said     to keep herself company.
The Familiar,she was  however  interrupted by an ill natured laugh  and  looking up  she saw through the old thorn hedge  which surrounded the garden  a singularly ill looking little man  whose countenance wore the stamp of menace and malignity  standing close to her  at the other side of the hawthorn screen.
The Familiar,she described herself as utterly unable to move or speak  while he charged her with a message for captain barton  the substance of which she distinctly remembered to have been to the effect  that he  captain barton  must come abroad as usual  and show himself to his friends  out of doors  or else prepare for a visit in his own chamber.
The Familiar,on concluding this brief message  the stranger had  with a threatening air  got down into the outer ditch  and  seizing the hawthorn stems in his hands  seemed on the point of climbing through the fence   a feat which might have been accomplished without much difficulty.
The Familiar,without  of course  awaiting this result  the girl   throwing down her treasures of thyme and rosemary   had turned and run  with the swiftness of terror  to the house.
The Familiar,lady l       commanded her  on pain of instant dismissal  to observe an absolute silence respecting all that passed of the incident which related to captain barton  and  at the same time  directed instant search to be made by her men  in the garden and the fields adjacent.
The Familiar,this measure  however  was as usual  unsuccessful  and  filled with undefinable misgivings  lady l       communicated the incident to her brother.
The Familiar,the story  however  until long afterwards  went no further  and  of course  it was jealously guarded from barton  who continued to amend  though slowly.
The Familiar,barton now began to walk occasionally in the court yard which i have mentioned  and which being enclosed by a high wall  commanded no view beyond its own extent.
The Familiar,here he  therefore  considered himself perfectly secure  and  but for a careless violation of orders by one of the grooms  he might have enjoyed  at least for some time longer  his much prized immunity.
The Familiar,opening upon the public road  this yard was entered by a wooden gate  with a wicket in it  and was further defended by an iron gate upon the outside.
The Familiar,strict orders had been given to keep both carefully locked  but  spite of these  it had happened that one day  as barton was slowly pacing this narrow enclosure  in his accustomed walk  and reaching the further extremity  was turning to retrace his steps  he saw the boarded wicket ajar  and the face of his tormentor immovably looking at him through the iron bars.
The Familiar,for a few seconds he stood riveted to the earth   breathless and bloodless   in the fascination of that dreaded gaze  and then fell helplessly insensible  upon the pavement.
The Familiar,there he was found a few minutes afterwards  and conveyed to his room   the apartment which he was never afterwards to leave alive.
The Familiar,henceforward a marked and unaccountable change was observable in the tone of his mind.
The Familiar,captain barton was now no longer the excited and despairing man he had been before  a strange alteration had passed upon him   an unearthly tranquillity reigned in his mind   it was the anticipated stillness of the grave.
The Familiar,montague  my friend  this struggle is nearly ended now    he said  tranquilly  but with a look of fixed and fearful awe.
The Familiar,i have  at last  some comfort from that world of spirits  from which my punishment has come.
The Familiar,i now know that my sufferings will soon be over.
The Familiar,montague pressed him to speak on.
The Familiar,yes    said he  in a softened voice     my punishment is nearly ended.
The Familiar,from sorrow  perhaps i shall never  in time or eternity  escape  but my agony is almost over.
The Familiar,comfort has been revealed to me  and what remains of my allotted struggle i will bear with submission   even with hope.
The Familiar,i am glad to hear you speak so tranquilly  my dear barton    said montague     peace and cheer of mind are all you need to make you what you were.
The Familiar,no  no   i never can be that    said he mournfully.
The Familiar,i am no longer fit for life.
The Familiar,i am soon to die.
The Familiar,i am to see him but once again  and then all is ended.
The Familiar,he said so  then    suggested montague.
The Familiar,he    no  no  good tidings could scarcely come through him  and these were good and welcome  and they came so solemnly and sweetly   with unutterable love and melancholy  such as i could not   without saying more than is needful  or fitting  of other long past scenes and persons   fully explain to you.
The Familiar,as barton said this he shed tears.
The Familiar,come  come    said montague  mistaking the source of his emotions     you must not give way.
The Familiar,what is it  after all  but a pack of dreams and nonsense  or  at worst  the practices of a scheming rascal that enjoys his power of playing upon your nerves  and loves to exert it   a sneaking vagabond that owes you a grudge  and pays it off this way  not daring to try a more manly one.
The Familiar,a grudge  indeed  he owes me   you say rightly    said barton  with a sudden shudder     a grudge as you call it.
The Familiar,oh  my god  when the justice of heaven permits the evil one to carry out a scheme of vengeance   when its execution is committed to the lost and terrible victim of sin  who owes his own ruin to the man  the very man  whom he is commissioned to pursue   then  indeed  the torments and terrors of hell are anticipated on earth.
The Familiar,but heaven has dealt mercifully with me   hope has opened to me at last  and if death could come without the dreadful sight i am doomed to see  i would gladly close my eyes this moment upon the world.
The Familiar,but though death is welcome  i shrink with an agony you cannot understand   an actual frenzy of terror   from the last encounter with that   that demon  who has drawn me thus to the verge of the chasm  and who is himself to plunge me down.
The Familiar,i am to see him again   once more   but under circumstances unutterably more terrific than ever.
The Familiar,as barton thus spoke  he trembled so violently that montague was really alarmed at the extremity of his sudden agitation  and hastened to lead him back to the topic which had before seemed to exert so tranquillizing an effect upon his mind.
The Familiar,it was not a dream    he said  after a time     i was in a different state   i felt differently and strangely  and yet it was all as real  as clear  and vivid  as what i now see and hear   it was a reality.
The Familiar,and what did you see and hear    urged his companion.
The Familiar,when i wakened from the swoon i fell into on seeing him    said barton  continuing as if he had not heard the question     it was slowly  very slowly   i was lying by the margin of a broad lake  with misty hills all round  and a soft  melancholy  rose coloured light illuminated it all.
The Familiar,it was unusually sad and lonely  and yet more beautiful than any earthly scene.
The Familiar,my head was leaning on the lap of a girl  and she was singing a song  that told  i know not how   whether by words or harmonies   of all my life   all that is past  and all that is still to come  and with the song the old feelings that i thought had perished within me came back  and tears flowed from my eyes   partly for the song and its mysterious beauty  and partly for the unearthly sweetness of her voice  and yet i knew the voice   oh  how well  and i was spell bound as i listened and looked at the solitary scene  without stirring  almost without breathing   and  alas  alas  without turning my eyes toward the face that i knew was near me  so sweetly powerful was the enchantment that held me.
The Familiar,and so  slowly  the song and scene grew fainter  and fainter  to my senses  till all was dark and still again.
The Familiar,and then i awoke to this world  as you saw  comforted  for i knew that i was forgiven much.
The Familiar,barton wept again long and bitterly.
The Familiar,from this time  as we have said  the prevailing tone of his mind was one of profound and tranquil melancholy.
The Familiar,this  however  was not without its interruptions.
The Familiar,he was thoroughly impressed with the conviction that he was to experience another and a final visitation  transcending in horror all he had before experienced.
The Familiar,from this anticipated and unknown agony  he often shrank in such paroxysms of abject terror and distraction  as filled the whole household with dismay and superstitious panic.
The Familiar,even those among them who affected to discredit the theory of preternatural agency  were often in their secret souls visited during the silence of night with qualms and apprehensions  which they would not have readily confessed  and none of them attempted to dissuade barton from the resolution on which he now systematically acted  of shutting himself up in his own apartment.
The Familiar,the window blinds of this room were kept jealously down  and his own man was seldom out of his presence  day or night  his bed being placed in the same chamber.
The Familiar,this man was an attached and respectable servant  and his duties  in addition to those ordinarily imposed upon valets  but which barton   s independent habits generally dispensed with  were to attend carefully to the simple precautions by means of which his master hoped to exclude the dreaded intrusion of the    watcher.
The Familiar,and  in addition to attending to those arrangements  which amounted merely to guarding against the possibility of his master   s being  through any unscreened window or open door  exposed to the dreaded influence  the valet was never to suffer him to be alone   total solitude  even for a minute  had become to him now almost as intolerable as the idea of going abroad into the public ways   it was an instinctive anticipation of what was coming.
The Familiar,it is needless to say  that under these circumstances  no steps were taken toward the fulfilment of that engagement into which he had entered.
The Familiar,there was quite disparity enough in point of years  and indeed of habits  between the young lady and captain barton  to have precluded anything like very vehement or romantic attachment on her part.
The Familiar,though grieved and anxious  therefore  she was very far from being heart broken.
The Familiar,miss montague  however  devoted much of her time to the patient but fruitless attempt to cheer the unhappy invalid.
The Familiar,she read for him  and conversed with him  but it was apparent that whatever exertions he made  the endeavour to escape from the one ever waking fear that preyed upon him  was utterly and miserably unavailing.
The Familiar,young ladies are much given to the cultivation of pets  and among those who shared the favour of miss montague was a fine old owl  which the gardener  who caught him napping among the ivy of a ruined stable  had dutifully presented to that young lady.
The Familiar,the caprice which regulates such preferences was manifested in the extravagant favour with which this grim and ill favoured bird was at once distinguished by his mistress  and  trifling as this whimsical circumstance may seem  i am forced to mention it  inasmuch as it is connected  oddly enough  with the concluding scene of the story.
The Familiar,barton  so far from sharing in this liking for the new favourite  regarded it from the first with an antipathy as violent as it was utterly unaccountable.
The Familiar,its very vicinity was unsupportable to him.
The Familiar,he seemed to hate and dread it with a vehemence absolutely laughable  and which to those who have never witnessed the exhibition of antipathies of this kind  would seem all but incredible.
The Familiar,with these few words of preliminary explanation  i shall proceed to state the particulars of the last scene in this strange series of incidents.
The Familiar,it was almost two o   clock one winter   s night  and barton was  as usual at that hour  in his bed  the servant we have mentioned occupied a smaller bed in the same room  and a light was burning.
The Familiar,the man was on a sudden aroused by his master  who said        i can   t get it out of my head that that accursed bird has got out somehow  and is lurking in some corner of the room.
The Familiar,i have been dreaming about him.
The Familiar,get up  smith  and look about  search for him.
The Familiar,such hateful dreams     the servant rose  and examined the chamber  and while engaged in so doing  he heard the well known sound  more like a long drawn gasp than a hiss  with which these birds from their secret haunts affright the quiet of the night.
The Familiar,this ghostly indication of its proximity   for the sound proceeded from the passage upon which barton   s chamber door opened   determined the search of the servant  who  opening the door  proceeded a step or two forward for the purpose of driving the bird away.
The Familiar,he had however  hardly entered the lobby  when the door behind him slowly swung to under the impulse  as it seemed  of some gentle current of air  but as immediately over the door there was a kind of window  intended in the day time to aid in lighting the passage  and through which at present the rays of the candle were issuing  the valet could see quite enough for his purpose.
The Familiar,as he advanced he heard his master   who  lying in a well curtained bed  had not  as it seemed  perceived his exit from the room   call him by name  and direct him to place the candle on the table by his bed.
The Familiar,the servant  who was now some way in the long passage  and not liking to raise his voice for the purpose of replying  lest he should startle the sleeping inmates of the house  began to walk hurriedly and softly back again  when  to his amazement  he heard a voice in the interior of the chamber answering calmly  and actually saw  through the window which over topped the door  that the light was slowly shifting  as if carried across the room in answer to his master   s call.
The Familiar,palsied by a feeling akin to terror  yet not unmingled with curiosity  he stood breathless and listening at the threshold  unable to summon resolution to push open the door and enter.
The Familiar,then came a rustling of the curtains  and a sound like that of one who in a low voice hushes a child to rest  in the midst of which he heard barton say  in a tone of stifled horror      oh  god   oh  my god    and repeat the same exclamation several times.
The Familiar,then ensued a silence  which again was broken by the same strange soothing sound  and at last there burst forth  in one swelling peal  a yell of agony so appalling and hideous  that  under some impulse of ungovernable horror  the man rushed to the door  and with his whole strength strove to force it open.
The Familiar,whether it was that  in his agitation  he had himself but imperfectly turned the handle  or that the door was really secured upon the inside  he failed to effect an entrance  and as he tugged and pushed  yell after yell rang louder and wilder through the chamber  accompanied all the while by the same hushed sounds.
The Familiar,actually freezing with terror  and scarce knowing what he did  the man turned and ran down the passage  wringing his hands in the extremity of horror and irresolution.
The Familiar,at the stair head he was encountered by general montague  scared and eager  and just as they met the fearful sounds had ceased.
The Familiar,what is it  who   where is your master    said montague with the incoherence of extreme agitation.
The Familiar,has anything   for god   s sake is anything wrong        lord have mercy on us  it   s all over    said the man staring wildly towards his master   s chamber.
The Familiar,he   s dead  sir  i   m sure he   s dead.
The Familiar,without waiting for inquiry or explanation  montague  closely followed by the servant  hurried to the chamber door  turned the handle  and pushed it open.
The Familiar,as the door yielded to his pressure  the ill omened bird of which the servant had been in search  uttering its spectral warning  started suddenly from the far side of the bed  and flying through the doorway close over their heads  and extinguishing  in his passage  the candle which montague carried  crashed through the skylight that overlooked the lobby  and sailed away into the darkness of the outer space.
The Familiar,there it is  god bless us    whispered the man  after a breathless pause.
The Familiar,curse that bird    muttered the general  startled by the suddenness of the apparition  and unable to conceal his discomposure.
The Familiar,the candle is moved    said the man  after another breathless pause  pointing to the candle that still burned in the room     see  they put it by the bed.
The Familiar,draw the curtains  fellow  and don   t stand gaping there    whispered montague  sternly.
The Familiar,the man hesitated.
The Familiar,hold this  then    said montague  impatiently thrusting the candlestick into the servant   s hand  and himself advancing to the bedside  he drew the curtains apart.
The Familiar,the light of the candle  which was still burning at the bedside  fell upon a figure huddled together  and half upright  at the head of the bed.
The Familiar,it seemed as though it had slunk back as far as the solid panelling would allow  and the hands were still clutched in the bed clothes.
The Familiar,barton  barton  barton    cried the general  with a strange mixture of awe and vehemence.
The Familiar,he took the candle  and held it so that it shone full upon the face.
The Familiar,the features were fixed  stern  and white  the jaw was fallen  and the sightless eyes  still open  gazed vacantly forward toward the front of the bed.
The Familiar,god almighty  he   s dead    muttered the general  as he looked upon this fearful spectacle.
The Familiar,they both continued to gaze upon it in silence for a minute or more.
The Familiar,and cold  too    whispered montague  withdrawing his hand from that of the dead man.
The Familiar,and see  see   may i never have life  sir    added the man  after a another pause  with a shudder     but there was something else on the bed with him.
The Familiar,look there   look there   see that  sir.
The Familiar,as the man thus spoke  he pointed to a deep indenture  as if caused by a heavy pressure  near the foot of the bed.
The Familiar,montague was silent.
The Familiar,come  sir  come away  for god   s sake    whispered the man  drawing close up to him  and holding fast by his arm  while he glanced fearfully round     what good can be done here now   come away  for god   s sake     at this moment they heard the steps of more than one approaching  and montague  hastily desiring the servant to arrest their progress  endeavoured to loose the rigid gripe with which the fingers of the dead man were clutched in the bed clothes  and drew  as well as he was able  the awful figure into a reclining posture  then closing the curtains carefully upon it  he hastened himself to meet those persons that were approaching.
The Familiar,it is needless to follow the personages so slightly connected with this narrative  into the events of their after life  it is enough to say  that no clue to the solution of these mysterious occurrences was ever after discovered  and so long an interval having now passed since the event which i have just described concluded this strange history  it is scarcely to be expected that time can throw any new lights upon its dark and inexplicable outline.
The Familiar,until the secrets of the earth shall be no longer hidden  therefore  these transactions must remain shrouded in their original obscurity.
The Familiar,the only occurrence in captain barton   s former life to which reference was ever made  as having any possible connexion with the sufferings with which his existence closed  and which he himself seemed to regard as working out a retribution for some grievous sin of his past life  was a circumstance which not for several years after his death was brought to light.
The Familiar,the nature of this disclosure was painful to his relatives  and discreditable to his memory.
The Familiar,it appeared that some six years before captain barton   s final return to dublin  he had formed  in the town of plymouth  a guilty attachment  the object of which was the daughter of one of the ship   s crew under his command.
The Familiar,the father had visited the frailty of his unhappy child with extreme harshness  and even brutality  and it was said that she had died heart broken.
The Familiar,presuming upon barton   s implication in her guilt  this man had conducted himself toward him with marked insolence  and barton retaliated this  and what he resented with still more exasperated bitterness   his treatment of the unfortunate girl   by a systematic exercise of those terrible and arbitrary severities which the regulations of the navy placed at the command of those who are responsible for its discipline.
The Familiar,the man had at length made his escape  while the vessel was in port at naples  but died  as it was said  in an hospital in that town  of the wounds inflicted in one of his recent and sanguinary punishments.
The Familiar,whether these circumstances in reality bear  or not  upon the occurrences of barton   s after life  it is  of course  impossible to say.
The Familiar,it seems  however more than probable that they were at least  in his own mind  closely associated with them.
The Familiar,but however the truth may be  as to the origin and motives of this mysterious persecution  there can be no doubt that  with respect to the agencies by which it was accomplished  absolute and impenetrable mystery is like to prevail until the day of doom.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,thirty years ago  an elderly man  to whom i paid quarterly a small annuity charged on some property of mine  came on the quarter day to receive it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was a dry  sad  quiet man  who had known better days  and had always maintained an unexceptionable character.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,no better authority could be imagined for a ghost story.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he told me one  though with a manifest reluctance  he was drawn into the narration by his choosing to explain what i should not have remarked  that he had called two days earlier than that week after the strict day of payment  which he had usually allowed to elapse.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his reason was a sudden determination to change his lodgings  and the consequent necessity of paying his rent a little before it was due.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he lodged in a dark street in westminster  in a spacious old house  very warm  being wainscoted from top to bottom  and furnished with no undue abundance of windows  and those fitted with thick sashes and small panes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this house was  as the bills upon the windows testified  offered to be sold or let.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but no one seemed to care to look at it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a thin matron  in rusty black silk  very taciturn  with large  steady  alarmed eyes  that seemed to look in your face  to read what you might have seen in the dark rooms and passages through which you had passed  was in charge of it  with a solitary    maid of all work    under her command.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,my poor friend had taken lodgings in this house  on account of their extraordinary cheapness.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had occupied them for nearly a year without the slightest disturbance  and was the only tenant  under rent  in the house.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had two rooms  a sitting room  and a bedroom with a closet opening from it  in which he kept his books and papers locked up.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had gone to his bed  having also locked the outer door.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,unable to sleep  he had lighted a candle  and after having read for a time  had laid the book beside him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he heard the old clock at the stair head strike one  and very shortly after  to his alarm  he saw the closet door  which he thought he had locked  open stealthily  and a slight dark man  particularly sinister  and somewhere about fifty  dressed in mourning of a very antique fashion  such a suit as we see in hogarth  entered the room on tip toe.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was followed by an elder man  stout  and blotched with scurvy  and whose features  fixed as a corpse   s  were stamped with dreadful force with a character of sensuality and villany.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this old man wore a flowered silk dressing gown and ruffles  and he remarked a gold ring on his finger  and on his head a cap of velvet  such as  in the days of perukes  gentlemen wore in undress.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this direful old man carried in his ringed and ruffled hand a coil of rope  and these two figures crossed the floor diagonally  passing the foot of his bed  from the closet door at the farther end of the room  at the left  near the window  to the door opening upon the lobby  close to the bed   s head  at his right.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he did not attempt to describe his sensations as these figures passed so near him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he merely said  that so far from sleeping in that room again  no consideration the world could offer would induce him so much as to enter it again alone  even in the daylight.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he found both doors  that of the closet  and that of the room opening upon the lobby  in the morning fast locked  as he had left them before going to bed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in answer to a question of mine  he said that neither appeared the least conscious of his presence.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they did not seem to glide  but walked as living men do  but without any sound  and he felt a vibration on the floor as they crossed it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he so obviously suffered from speaking about the apparitions  that i asked him no more questions.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there were in his description  however  certain coincidences so very singular  as to induce me  by that very post  to write to a friend much my senior  then living in a remote part of england  for the information which i knew he could give me.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had himself more than once pointed out that old house to my attention  and told me  though very briefly  the strange story which i now asked him to give me in greater detail.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his answer satisfied me  and the following pages convey its substance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,your letter  he wrote  tells me you desire some particulars about the closing years of the life of mr. justice harbottle  one of the judges of the court of common pleas.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you refer  of course  to the extraordinary occurrences that made that period of his life long after a theme for    winter tales    and metaphysical speculation.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i happen to know perhaps more than any other man living of those mysterious particulars.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the old family mansion  when i revisited london  more than thirty years ago  i examined for the last time.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,during the years that have passed since then  i hear that improvement  with its preliminary demolitions  has been doing wonders for the quarter of westminster in which it stood.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,if i were quite certain that the house had been taken down  i should have no difficulty about naming the street in which it stood.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,as what i have to tell  however  is not likely to improve its letting value  and as i should not care to get into trouble  i prefer being silent on that particular point.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,how old the house was  i can   t tell.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,people said it was built by roger harbottle  a turkey merchant  in the reign of king james i. i am not a good opinion upon such questions  but having been in it  though in its forlorn and deserted state.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i can tell you in a general way what it was like.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was built of dark red brick  and the door and windows were faced with stone that had turned yellow by time.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it receded some feet from the line of the other houses in the street  and it had a florid and fanciful rail of iron about the broad steps that invited your ascent to the hall door  in which were fixed  under a file of lamps  among scrolls and twisted leaves  two immense    extinguishers     like the conical caps of fairies  into which  in old times  the footmen used to thrust their flambeaux when their chairs or coaches had set down their great people  in the hall or at the steps  as the case might be.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that hall is panelled up to the ceiling  and has a large fire place.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,two or three stately old rooms open from it at each side.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the windows of these are tall  with many small panes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,passing through the arch at the back of the hall  you come upon the wide and heavy well staircase.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there is a back staircase also.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the mansion is large  and has not as much light  by any means  in proportion to its extent  as modern houses enjoy.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,when i saw it  it had long been untenanted  and had the gloomy reputation beside of a haunted house.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,cobwebs floated from the ceilings or spanned the corners of the cornices  and dust lay thick over everything.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the windows were stained with the dust and rain of fifty years  and darkness had thus grown darker.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,when i made it my first visit  it was in company with my father  when i was still a boy  in the year     .
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i was about twelve years old  and my imagination impressible  as it always is at that age.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i looked about me with great awe.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i was here in the very centre and scene of those occurrences which i had heard recounted at the fire side at home  with so delightful a horror.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,my father was an old bachelor of nearly sixty when he married.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had  when a child  seen judge harbottle on the bench in his robes and wig a dozen times at least before his death  which took place in       and his appearance made a powerful and unpleasant impression  not only on his imagination  but upon his nerves.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge was at that time a man of some sixty seven years.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had a great mulberry coloured face  a big  carbuncled nose  fierce eyes  and a grim and brutal mouth.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,my father  who was young at the time  thought it the most formidable face he had ever seen  for there were evidences of intellectual power in the formation and lines of the forehead.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his voice was loud and harsh  and gave effect to the sarcasm which was his habitual weapon on the bench.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this old gentleman had the reputation of being about the wickedest man in england.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,even on the bench he now and then showed his scorn of opinion.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had carried cases his own way  it was said  in spite of counsel  authorities  and even of juries  by a sort of cajolery  violence  and bamboozling  that somehow confused and overpowered resistance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had never actually committed himself  he was too cunning to do that.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had the character of being  however  a dangerous and unscrupulous judge  but his character did not trouble him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the associates he chose for his hours of relaxation cared as little as he did about it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,one night during the session of      this old judge went down in his chair to wait in one of the rooms of the house of lords for the result of a division in which he and his order were interested.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this over  he was about to return to his house close by  in his chair  but the night had become so soft and fine that he changed his mind  sent it home empty  and with two footmen  each with a flambeau  set out on foot in preference.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,gout had made him rather a slow pedestrian.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it took him some time to get through the two or three streets he had to pass before reaching his house.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in one of those narrow streets of tall houses  perfectly silent at that hour  he overtook  slowly as he was walking  a very singular looking old gentleman.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had a bottle green coat on  with a cape to it  and large stone buttons  a broad leafed low crowned hat  from under which a big powdered wig escaped  he stooped very much  and supported his bending knees with the aid of a crutch handled cane  and so shuffled and tottered along painfully.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i ask your pardon  sir    said this old man in a very quavering voice  as the burly judge came up with him  and he extended his hand feebly towards his arm.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mr. justice harbottle saw that the man was by no means poorly dressed  and his manner that of a gentleman.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge stopped short  and said  in his harsh peremptory tones     well  sir  how can i serve you        can you direct me to judge harbottle   s house  i have some intelligence of the very last importance to communicate to him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,can you tell it before witnesses    asked the judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,by no means  it must reach his ear only    quavered the old man earnestly.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,if that be so  sir  you have only to accompany me a few steps farther to reach my house  and obtain a private audience  for i am judge harbottle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,with this invitation the infirm gentleman in the white wig complied very readily  and in another minute the stranger stood in what was then termed the front parlour of the judge   s house  t  te    t  te with that shrewd and dangerous functionary.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had to sit down  being very much exhausted  and unable for a little time to speak  and then he had a fit of coughing  and after that a fit of gasping  and thus two or three minutes passed  during which the judge dropped his roquelaure on an arm chair  and threw his cocked hat over that.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the venerable pedestrian in the white wig quickly recovered his voice.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,with closed doors they remained together for some time.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there were guests waiting in the drawing rooms  and the sound of men   s voices laughing  and then of a female voice singing to a harpsichord  were heard distinctly in the hall over the stairs  for old judge harbottle had arranged one of his dubious jollifications  such as might well make the hair of godly men   s heads stand upright  for that night.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this old gentleman in the powdered white wig  that rested on his stooped shoulders  must have had something to say that interested the judge very much  for he would not have parted on easy terms with the ten minutes and upwards which that conference filched from the sort of revelry in which he most delighted  and in which he was the roaring king  and in some sort the tyrant also  of his company.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the footman who showed the aged gentleman out observed that the judge   s mulberry coloured face  pimples and all  were bleached to a dingy yellow  and there was the abstraction of agitated thought in his manner  as he bid the stranger good night.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the servant saw that the conversation had been of serious import  and that the judge was frightened.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,instead of stumping upstairs forthwith to his scandalous hilarities  his profane company  and his great china bowl of punch   the identical bowl from which a bygone bishop of london  good easy man  had baptised this judge   s grandfather  now clinking round the rim with silver ladles  and hung with scrolls of lemon peel   instead  i say  of stumping and clambering up the great staircase to the cavern of his circean enchantment  he stood with his big nose flattened against the window pane  watching the progress of the feeble old man  who clung stiffly to the iron rail as he got down  step by step  to the pavement.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the hall door had hardly closed  when the old judge was in the hall bawling hasty orders  with such stimulating expletives as old colonels under excitement sometimes indulge in now a days  with a stamp or two of his big foot  and a waving of his clenched fist in the air.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he commanded the footman to overtake the old gentleman in the white wig  to offer him his protection on his way home  and in no case to show his face again without having ascertained where he lodged  and who he was  and all about him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,by         sirrah  if you fail me in this  you doff my livery to night     forth bounced the stalwart footman  with his heavy cane under his arm  and skipped down the steps  and looked up and down the street after the singular figure  so easy to recognise.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,what were his adventures i shall not tell you just now.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the old man  in the conference to which he had been admitted in that stately panelled room  had just told the judge a very strange story.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he might be himself a conspirator  he might possibly be crazed  or possibly his whole story was straight and true.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the aged gentleman in the bottle green coat  on finding himself alone with mr. justice harbottle  had become agitated.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he said      there is  perhaps you are not aware  my lord  a prisoner in shrewsbury jail  charged with having forged a bill of exchange for a hundred and twenty pounds  and his name is lewis pyneweck  a grocer of that town.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,is there    says the judge  who knew well that there was.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,yes  my lord    says the old man.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,then you had better say nothing to affect this case.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,if you do  by        i   ll commit you  for i   m to try it    says the judge  with his terrible look and tone.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i am not going to do anything of the kind  my lord  of him or his case i know nothing  and care nothing.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but a fact has come to my knowledge which it behoves you to well consider.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and what may that fact be    inquired the judge     i   m in haste  sir  and beg you will use dispatch.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it has come to my knowledge  my lord  that a secret tribunal is in process of formation  the object of which is to take cognisance of the conduct of the judges  and first  of your conduct  my lord  it is a wicked conspiracy.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,who are of it    demands the judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i know not a single name as yet.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i know but the fact  my lord  it is most certainly true.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   ll have you before the privy council  sir    says the judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that is what i most desire  but not for a day or two  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and why so        i have not as yet a single name  as i told your lordship  but i expect to have a list of the most forward men in it  and some other papers connected with the plot  in two or three days.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you said one or two just now.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,about that time  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,is this a jacobite plot        in the main i think it is  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,why  then  it is political.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i have tried no state prisoners  nor am like to try any such.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,how  then  doth it concern me        from what i can gather  my lord  there are those in it who desire private revenges upon certain judges.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,what do they call their cabal        the high court of appeal  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,who are you sir  what is your name        hugh peters  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that should be a whig name        it is  my lord.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,where do you lodge  mr. peters        in thames street  my lord  over against the sign of the three kings.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,three kings  take care one be not too many for you  mr. peters  how come you  an honest whig  as you say  to be privy to a jacobite plot  answer me that.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,my lord  a person in whom i take an interest has been seduced to take a part in it  and being frightened at the unexpected wickedness of their plans  he is resolved to become an informer for the crown.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he resolves like a wise man  sir.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,what does he say of the persons  who are in the plot  doth he know them        only two  my lord  but he will be introduced to the club in a few days  and he will then have a list  and more exact information of their plans  and above all of their oaths  and their hours and places of meeting  with which he wishes to be acquainted before they can have any suspicions of his intentions.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and being so informed  to whom  think you  my lord  had he best go then        to the king   s attorney general straight.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but you say this concerns me  sir  in particular  how about this prisoner  lewis pyneweck  is he one of them        i can   t tell  my lord  but for some reason  it is thought your lordship will be well advised if you try him not.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,for if you do  it is feared    twill shorten your days.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,so far as i can learn  mr. peters  this business smells pretty strong of blood and treason.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the king   s attorney general will know how to deal with it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,when shall i see you again  sir        if you give me leave  my lord  either before your lordship   s court sits  or after it rises  to morrow.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i should like to come and tell your lordship what has passed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,do so  mr. peters  at nine o   clock to morrow morning.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and see you play me no trick  sir  in this matter  if you do  by         sir  i   ll lay you by the heels        you need fear no trick from me  my lord  had i not wished to serve you  and acquit my own conscience  i never would have come all this way to talk with your lordship.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   m willing to believe you  mr. peters  i   m willing to believe you  sir.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and upon this they parted.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he has either painted his face  or he is consumedly sick    thought the old judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the light had shone more effectually upon his features as he turned to leave the room with a low bow  and they looked  he fancied  unnaturally chalky.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,d       him    said the judge ungraciously  as he began to scale the stairs     he has half spoiled my supper.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but if he had  no one but the judge himself perceived it  and the evidence was all  as any one might perceive  the other way.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in the meantime  the footman dispatched in pursuit of mr. peters speedily overtook that feeble gentleman.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the old man stopped when he heard the sound of pursuing steps  but any alarms that may have crossed his mind seemed to disappear on his recognising the livery.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he very gratefully accepted the proferred assistance  and placed his tremulous arm within the servant   s for support.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they had not gone far  however  when the old man stopped suddenly  saying      dear me  as i live  i have dropped it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you heard it fall.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,my eyes  i fear  won   t serve me  and i   m unable to stoop low enough  but if you will look  you shall have half the find.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it is a guinea  i carried it in my glove.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the street was silent and deserted.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the footman had hardly descended to what he termed his    hunkers    and begun to search the pavement about the spot which the old man indicated  when mr. peters  who seemed very much exhausted  and breathed with difficulty  struck him a violent blow  from above  over the back of the head with a heavy instrument  and then another  and leaving him bleeding and senseless in the gutter  ran like a lamp lighter down a lane to the right  and was gone.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,when  an hour later  the watchman brought the man in livery home  still stupid and covered with blood  judge harbottle cursed his servant roundly  swore he was drunk  threatened him with an indictment for taking bribes to betray his master  and cheered him with a perspective of the broad street leading from the old bailey to tyburn  the cart   s tail  and the hangman   s lash.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,notwithstanding this demonstration  the judge was pleased.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was a disguised    affidavit man    or footpad  no doubt  who had been employed to frighten him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the trick had fallen through.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a    court of appeal    such as the false hugh peters had indicated  with assassination for its sanction  would be an uncomfortable institution for a    hanging judge   like the honourable justice harbottle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that sarcastic and ferocious administrator of the criminal code of england  at that time a rather pharisaical  bloody  and heinous system of justice  had reasons of his own for choosing to try that very lewis pyneweck  on whose behalf this audacious trick was devised.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,try him he would.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,no man living should take that morsel out of his mouth.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,of lewis pyneweck of course  so far as the outer world could see  he knew nothing.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he would try him after his fashion  without fear  favour  or affection.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but did he not remember a certain thin man  dressed in mourning  in whose house  in shrewsbury  the judge   s lodgings used to be  until a scandal of his ill treating his wife came suddenly to light  a grocer with a demure look  a soft step  and a lean face as dark as mahogany  with a nose sharp and long  standing ever so little awry  and a pair of dark steady brown eyes under thinly traced black brows   a man whose thin lips wore always a faint unpleasant smile.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,had not that scoundrel an account to settle with the judge  had he not been troublesome lately  and was not his name lewis pyneweck  some time grocer in shrewsbury  and now prisoner in the jail of that town   the reader may take it  if he pleases  as a sign that judge harbottle was a good christian  that he suffered nothing ever from remorse.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that was undoubtedly true.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had nevertheless done this grocer  forger  what you will  some five or six years before  a grievous wrong  but it was not that  but a possible scandal  and possible complications  that troubled the learned judge now.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,did he not  as a lawyer  know  that to bring a man from his shop to the dock  the chances must be at least ninety nine out of a hundred that he is guilty.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a weak man like his learned brother withershins was not a judge to keep the high roads safe  and make crime tremble.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,old judge harbottle was the man to make the evil disposed quiver  and to refresh the world with showers of wicked blood  and thus save the innocent  to the refrain of the ancient saw he loved to quote   foolish pity ruins a city.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in hanging that fellow he could not be wrong.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the eye of a man accustomed to look upon the dock could not fail to read    villain   written sharp and clear in his plotting face.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,of course he would try him  and no one else should.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a saucy looking woman  still handsome  in a mob cap gay with blue ribbons  in a saque of flowered silk  with lace and rings on  much too fine for the judge   s housekeeper  which nevertheless she was  peeped into his study next morning  and  seeing the judge alone  stepped in.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,here   s another letter from him  come by the post this morning.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,can   t you do nothing for him    she said wheedlingly  with her arm over his neck  and her delicate finger and thumb fiddling with the lobe of his purple ear.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   ll try    said judge harbottle  not raising his eyes from the paper he was reading.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i knew you   d do what i asked you    she said.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge clapt his gouty claw over his heart  and made her an ironical bow.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,what    she asked     will you do        hang him    said the judge with a chuckle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you don   t mean to  no  you don   t  my little man    said she  surveying herself in a mirror on the wall.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   m d      d but i think you   re falling in love with your husband at last    said judge harbottle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   m blest but i think you   re growing jealous of him    replied the lady with a laugh.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but no  he was always a bad one to me  i   ve done with him long ago.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and he with you  by george  when he took your fortune and your spoons and your ear rings  he had all he wanted of you.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he drove you from his house  and when he discovered you had made yourself comfortable  and found a good situation  he   d have taken your guineas and your silver and your ear rings over again  and then allowed you half a dozen years more to make a new harvest for his mill.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you don   t wish him good  if you say you do  you lie.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she laughed a wicked saucy laugh  and gave the terrible rhadamanthus a playful tap on the chops.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he wants me to send him money to fee a counsellor    she said  while her eyes wandered over the pictures on the wall  and back again to the looking glass  and certainly she did not look as if his jeopardy troubled her very much.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,confound his impudence  the scoundrel    thundered the old judge  throwing himself back in his chair  as he used to do in furore on the bench  and the lines of his mouth looked brutal  and his eyes ready to leap from their sockets.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,if you answer his letter from my house to please yourself  you   ll write your next from somebody else   s to please me.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you understand  my pretty witch  i   ll not be pestered.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,come  no pouting  whimpering won   t do.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you don   t care a brass farthing for the villain  body or soul.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you came here but to make a row.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,you are one of mother carey   s chickens  and where you come  the storm is up.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,get you gone  baggage  get you gone    he repeated with a stamp  for a knock at the hall door made her instantaneous disappearance indispensable.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i need hardly say that the venerable hugh peters did not appear again.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge never mentioned him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but oddly enough  considering how he laughed to scorn the weak invention which he had blown into dust at the very first puff  his white wigged visitor and the conference in the dark front parlour was often in his memory.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his shrewd eye told him that allowing for change of tints and such disguises as the playhouse affords every night  the features of this false old man  who had turned out too hard for his tall footman  were identical with those of lewis pyneweck.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,judge harbottle made his registrar call upon the crown solicitor  and tell him that there was a man in town who bore a wonderful resemblance to a prisoner in shrewsbury jail named lewis pyneweck  and to make inquiry through the post forthwith whether any one was personating pyneweck in prison  and whether he had thus or otherwise made his escape.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the prisoner was safe  however  and no question as to his identity.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in due time judge harbottle went circuit  and in due time the judges were in shrewsbury.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,news travelled slowly in those days  and newspapers  like the wagons and stage coaches  took matters easily.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mrs. pyneweck  in the judge   s house  with a diminished household   the greater part of the judge   s servants having gone with him  for he had given up riding circuit  and travelled in his coach in state   kept house rather solitarily at home.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in spite of quarrels  in spite of mutual injuries   some of them  inflicted by herself  enormous   in spite of a married life of spited bickerings   a life in which there seemed no love or liking or forbearance  for years   now that pyneweck stood in near danger of death  something like remorse came suddenly upon her.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she knew that in shrewsbury were transacting the scenes which were to determine his fate.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she knew she did not love him  but she could not have supposed  even a fortnight before  that the hour of suspense could have affected her so powerfully.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she knew the day on which the trial was expected to take place.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she could not get it out of her head for a minute  she felt faint as it drew towards evening.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,two or three days passed  and then she knew that the trial must be over by this time.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there were floods between london and shrewsbury  and news was long delayed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she wished the floods would last for ever.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was dreadful waiting to hear  dreadful to know that the event was over  and that she could not hear till self willed rivers subsided  dreadful to know that they must subside and the news come at last.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she had some vague trust in the judge   s good nature  and much in the resources of chance and accident.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she had contrived to send the money he wanted.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he would not be without legal advice and energetic and skilled support.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,at last the news did come   a long arrear all in a gush  a letter from a female friend in shrewsbury  a return of the sentences  sent up for the judge  and most important  because most easily got at  being told with great aplomb and brevity  the long deferred intelligence of the shrewsbury assizes in the morning advertiser.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,like an impatient reader of a novel  who reads the last page first  she read with dizzy eyes the list of the executions.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,two were respited  seven were hanged  and in that capital catalogue was this line      lewis pyneweck   forgery.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she had to read it half a dozen times over before she was sure she understood it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,here was the paragraph          sentence  death    .
Mr. Justice Harbottle,executed accordingly  on friday the   th instant  to wit          thomas primer  alias duck   highway robbery.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,flora guy   stealing to the value of   s.  d.         arthur pounden   burglary.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,matilda mummery   riot.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,lewis pyneweck   forgery  bill of exchange.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and when she reached this  she read it over and over  feeling very cold and sick.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this buxom housekeeper was known in the house as mrs. carwell   carwell being her maiden name  which she had resumed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,no one in the house except its master knew her history.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,her introduction had been managed craftily.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,no one suspected that it had been concerted between her and the old reprobate in scarlet and ermine.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,flora carwell ran up the stairs now  and snatched her little girl  hardly seven years of age  whom she met on the lobby  hurriedly up in her arms  and carried her into her bedroom  without well knowing what she was doing  and sat down  placing the child before her.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she was not able to speak.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she held the child before her  and looked in the little girl   s wondering face  and burst into tears of horror.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she thought  the judge could have saved him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i daresay he could.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,for a time she was furious with him  and hugged and kissed her bewildered little girl  who returned her gaze with large round eyes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that little girl had lost her father  and knew nothing of the matter.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she had been always told that her father was dead long ago.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a woman  coarse  uneducated  vain  and violent  does not reason  or even feel  very distinctly  but in these tears of consternation were mingling a self upbraiding.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she felt afraid of that little child.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but mrs. carwell was a person who lived not upon sentiment  but upon beef and pudding  she consoled herself with punch  she did not trouble herself long even with resentments  she was a gross and material person  and could not mourn over the irrevocable for more than a limited number of hours  even if she would.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,judge harbottle was soon in london again.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,except the gout  this savage old epicurean never knew a day   s sickness.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he laughed and coaxed and bullied away the young woman   s faint upbraidings  and in a little time lewis pyneweck troubled her no more  and the judge secretly chuckled over the perfectly fair removal of a bore  who might have grown little by little into something very like a tyrant.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was the lot of the judge whose adventures i am now recounting to try criminal cases at the old bailey shortly after his return.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had commenced his charge to the jury in a case of forgery  and was  after his wont  thundering dead against the prisoner  with many a hard aggravation and cynical gibe  when suddenly all died away in silence  and  instead of looking at the jury  the eloquent judge was gaping at some person in the body of the court.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,among the persons of small importance who stand and listen at the sides was one tall enough to show with a little prominence  a slight mean figure  dressed in seedy black  lean and dark of visage.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had just handed a letter to the crier  before he caught the judge   s eye.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that judge descried  to his amazement  the features of lewis pyneweck.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he has the usual faint thin lipped smile  and with his blue chin raised in air  and as it seemed quite unconscious of the distinguished notice he has attracted  he was stretching his low cravat with his crooked fingers  while he slowly turned his head from side to side   a process which enabled the judge to see distinctly a stripe of swollen blue round his neck  which indicated  he thought  the grip of the rope.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this man  with a few others  had got a footing on a step  from which he could better see the court.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he now stepped down  and the judge lost sight of him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his lordship signed energetically with his hand in the direction in which this man had vanished.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he turned to the tipstaff.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his first effort to speak ended in a gasp.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he cleared his throat  and told the astounded official to arrest that man who had interrupted the court.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he   s but this moment gone down there.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,bring him in custody before me  within ten minutes    time  or i   ll strip your gown from your shoulders and fine the sheriff    he thundered  while his eyes flashed round the court in search of the functionary.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,attorneys  counsellors  idle spectators  gazed in the direction in which mr. justice harbottle had shaken his gnarled old hand.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they compared notes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,not one had seen any one making a disturbance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they asked one another if the judge was losing his head.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,nothing came of the search.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his lordship concluded his charge a great deal more tamely  and when the jury retired  he stared round the court with a wandering mind  and looked as if he would not have given sixpence to see the prisoner hanged.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge had received the letter  had he known from whom it came  he would no doubt have read it instantaneously.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,as it was he simply read the direction   to the honourable the lord justice elijah harbottle   one of his majesty   s justices of the honourable court of common pleas.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it remained forgotten in his pocket till he reached home.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,when he pulled out that and others from the capacious pocket of his coat  it had its turn  as he sat in his library in his thick silk dressing gown  and then he found its contents to be a closely written letter  in a clerk   s hand  and an enclosure in    secretary hand     as i believe the angular scrivinary of law writings in those days was termed  engrossed on a bit of parchment about the size of this page.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the letter said      mr. justice harbottle    my lord      i am ordered by the high court of appeal to acquaint your lordship  in order to your better preparing yourself for your trial  that a true bill hath been sent down  and the indictment lieth against your lordship for the murder of one lewis pyneweck of shrewsbury  citizen  wrongfully executed for the forgery of a bill of exchange  on the   the day of        last  by reason of the wilful perversion of the evidence  and the undue pressure put upon the jury  together with the illegal admission of evidence by your lordship  well knowing the same to be illegal  by all which the promoter of the prosecution of the said indictment  before the high court of appeal  hath lost his life.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and the trial of the said indictment  i am farther ordered to acquaint your lordship is fixed for the   th day of        next ensuing  by the right honourable the lord chief justice twofold  of the court aforesaid  to wit  the high court of appeal  on which day it will most certainly take place.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and i am farther to acquaint your lordship  to prevent any surprise or miscarriage  that your case stands first for the said day  and that the said high court of appeal sits day and night  and never rises  and herewith  by order of the said court  i furnish your lordship with a copy  extract  of the record in this case  except of the indictment  whereof  notwithstanding  the substance and effect is supplied to your lordship in this notice.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and farther i am to inform you  that in case the jury then to try your lordship should find you guilty  the right honourable the lord chief justice will  in passing sentence of death upon you  fix the day of execution for the   th day of         being one calendar month from the day of your trial.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was signed by    caleb searcher      officer of the crown solicitor in the    kingdom of life and death.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge glanced through the parchment.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,sblood  do they think a man like me is to be bamboozled by their buffoonery     the judge   s coarse features were wrung into one of his sneers  but he was pale.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,possibly  after all  there was a conspiracy on foot.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was queer.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,did they mean to pistol him in his carriage  or did they only aim at frightening him   judge harbottle had more than enough of animal courage.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was not afraid of highwaymen  and he had fought more than his share of duels  being a foul mouthed advocate while he held briefs at the bar.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,no one questioned his fighting qualities.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but with respect to this particular case of pyneweck  he lived in a house of glass.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,was there not his pretty  dark eyed  over dressed housekeeper  mrs. flora carwell  very easy for people who knew shrewsbury to identify mrs. pyneweck  if once put upon the scent  and had he not stormed and worked hard in that case  had he not made it hard sailing for the prisoner  did he not know very well what the bar thought of it  it would be the worst scandal that ever blasted judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,so much there was intimidating in the matter  but nothing more.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge was a little bit gloomy for a day or two after  and more testy with every one than usual.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he locked up the papers  and about a week after he asked his housekeeper  one day  in the library      had your husband never a brother     mrs. carwell squalled on this sudden introduction of the funereal topic  and cried exemplary    piggins full    as the judge used pleasantly to say.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but he was in no mood for trifling now  and he said sternly      come  madam  this wearies me.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,do it another time  and give me an answer to my question.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,so she did.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,pyneweck had no brother living.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he once had one  but he died in jamaica.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,how do you know he is dead    asked the judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,because he told me so.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,not the dead man        pyneweck told me so.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,is that all    sneered the judge.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he pondered this matter  and time went on.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge was growing a little morose  and less enjoying.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the subject struck nearer to his thoughts than he fancied it could have done.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but so it is with most undivulged vexations  and there was no one to whom he could tell this one.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was now the ninth  and mr. justice harbottle was glad.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he knew nothing would come of it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,still it bothered him  and to morrow would see it well over.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,what of the paper  i have cited  no one saw it during his life  no one  after his death.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he spoke of it to dr. hedstone  and what purported to be    a copy    in the old judge   s hand writing  was found.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the original was nowhere.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,was it a copy of an illusion  incident to brain disease  such is my belief.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,judge harbottle went this night to the play at drury lane.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was one of those old fellows who care nothing for late hours  and occasional knocking about in pursuit of pleasure.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had appointed with two cronies of lincoln   s inn to come home in his coach with him to sup after the play.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they were not in his box  but were to meet him near the entrance  and to get into his carriage there  and mr. justice harbottle  who hated waiting  was looking a little impatiently from the window.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge yawned.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he told the footman to watch for counsellor thavies and counsellor beller  who were coming  and  with another yawn  he laid his cocked hat on his knees  closed his eyes  leaned back in his corner  wrapped his mantle closer about him  and began to think of pretty mrs. abington.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and being a man who could sleep like a sailor  at a moment   s notice  he was thinking of taking a nap.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,those fellows had no business to keep a judge waiting.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he heard their voices now.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,those rake hell counsellors were laughing  and bantering  and sparring after their wont.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the carriage swayed and jerked  as one got in  and then again as the other followed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the door clapped  and the coach was now jogging and rumbling over the pavement.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge was a little bit sulky.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he did not care to sit up and open his eyes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,let them suppose he was asleep.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he heard them laugh with more malice than good humour  he thought  as they observed it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he would give them a d      d hard knock or two when they got to his door  and till then he would counterfeit his nap.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the clocks were chiming twelve.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,beller and thavies were silent as tombstones.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they were generally loquacious and merry rascals.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge suddenly felt himself roughly seized and thrust from his corner into the middle of the seat  and opening his eyes  instantly he found himself between his two companions.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,before he could blurt out the oath that was at his lips  he saw that they were two strangers   evil looking fellows  each with a pistol in his hand  and dressed like bow street officers.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge clutched at the check string.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the coach pulled up.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he stared about him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they were not among houses  but through the windows  under a broad moonlight  he saw a black moor stretching lifelessly from right to left  with rotting trees  pointing fantastic branches in the air  standing here and there in groups  as if they held up their arms and twigs like fingers  in horrible glee at the judge   s coming.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a footman came to the window.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he knew his long face and sunken eyes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he knew it was dingly chuff  fifteen years ago a footman in his service  whom he had turned off at a moment   s notice  in a burst of jealousy  and indicted for a missing spoon.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the man had died in prison of the jail fever.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge drew back in utter amazement.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his armed companions signed mutely  and they were again gliding over this unknown moor.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the bloated and gouty old man  in his horror  considered the question of resistance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but his athletic days were long over.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this moor was a desert.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was no help to be had.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was in the hands of strange servants  even if his recognition turned out to be a delusion  and they were under the command of his captors.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was nothing for it but submission  for the present.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,suddenly the coach was brought nearly to a standstill  so that the prisoner saw an ominous sight from the window.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was a gigantic gallows beside the road  it stood three sided  and from each of its three broad beams at top depended in chains some eight or ten bodies  from several of which the cere clothes had dropped away  leaving the skeletons swinging lightly by their chains.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a tall ladder reached to the summit of the structure  and on the peat beneath lay bones.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,on top of the dark transverse beam facing the road  from which  as from the other two completing the triangle of death  dangled a row of these unfortunates in chains  a hang man  with a pipe in his mouth  much as we see him in the famous print of the    idle apprentice     though here his perch was ever so much higher  was reclining at his ease and listlessly shying bones  from a little heap at his elbow  at the skeletons that hung round  bringing down now a rib or two  now a hand  now half a leg.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a long sighted man could have discerned that he was a dark fellow  lean  and from continually looking down on the earth from the elevation over which  in another sense  he always hung  his nose  his lips  his chin were pendulous and loose  and drawn down into a monstrous grotesque.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this fellow took his pipe from his mouth on seeing the coach  stood up  and cut some solemn capers high on his beam  and shook a new rope in the air  crying with a voice high and distant as the caw of a raven hovering over a gibbet     a rope for judge harbottle     the coach was now driving on at its old swift pace.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,so high a gallows as that  the judge had never  even in his most hilarious moments  dreamed of.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he thought he must be raving.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and the dead footman  he shook his ears and strained his eyelids  but if he was dreaming  he was unable to awake himself.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was no good in threatening these scoundrels.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a brutum fulmen might bring a real one on his head.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,any submission to get out of their hands  and then heaven and earth he would move to unearth and hunt them down.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,suddenly they drove round a corner of a vast white building  and under a porte coch  re.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge found himself in a corridor lighted with dingy oil lamps  the walls of bare stone  it looked like a passage in a prison.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his guards placed him in the hands of other people.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,here and there he saw bony and gigantic soldiers passing to and fro  with muskets over their shoulders.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they looked straight before them  grinding their teeth  in bleak fury  with no noise but the clank of their shoes.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he saw these by glimpses  round corners  and at the ends of passages  but he did not actually pass them by.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and now  passing under a narrow doorway  he found himself in the dock  confronting a judge in his scarlet robes  in a large court house.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was nothing to elevate this temple of themis above its vulgar kind elsewhere.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,dingy enough it looked  in spite of candles lighted in decent abundance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a case had just closed  and the last juror   s back was seen escaping through the door in the wall of the jury box.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there were some dozen barristers  some fiddling with pen and ink  others buried in briefs  some beckoning  with the plumes of their pens  to their attorneys  of whom there were no lack  there were clerks to ing and fro ing  and the officers of the court  and the registrar  who was handing up a paper to the judge  and the tipstaff  who was presenting a note at the end of his wand to a king   s counsel over the heads of the crowd between.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,if this was the high court of appeal  which never rose day or night  it might account for the pale and jaded aspect of everybody in it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,an air of indescribable gloom hung upon the pallid features of all the people here  no one ever smiled  all looked more or less secretly suffering.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the king against elijah harbottle    shouted the officer.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,is the appellant lewis pyneweck in court    asked chief justice twofold  in a voice of thunder  that shook the woodwork of the court  and boomed down the corridors.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,up stood pyneweck from his place at the table.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,arraign the prisoner    roared the chief  and judge harbottle felt the pannels of the dock round him  and the floor  and the rails quiver in the vibrations of that tremendous voice.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the prisoner  in limine  objected to this pretended court  as being a sham  and non existent in point of law  and then  that  even if it were a court constituted by law   the judge was growing dazed   it had not and could not have any jurisdiction to try him for his conduct on the bench.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,whereupon the chief justice laughed suddenly  and every one in court  turning round upon the prisoner  laughed also  till the laugh grew and roared all round like a deafening acclamation  he saw nothing but glittering eyes and teeth  a universal stare and grin  but though all the voices laughed  not a single face of all those that concentrated their gaze upon him looked like a laughing face.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the mirth subsided as suddenly as it began.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the indictment was read.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,judge harbottle actually pleaded  he pleaded    not guilty.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a jury were sworn.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the trial proceeded.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,judge harbottle was bewildered.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this could not be real.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he must be either mad  or going mad  he thought.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,one thing could not fail to strike even him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this chief justice twofold  who was knocking him about at every turn with sneer and gibe  and roaring him down with his tremendous voice  was a dilated effigy of himself  an image of mr. justice harbottle  at least double his size  and with all his fierce colouring  and his ferocity of eye and visage  enhanced awfully.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,nothing the prisoner could argue  cite  or state was permitted to retard for a moment the march of the case towards its catastrophe.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the chief justice seemed to feel his power over the jury  and to exult and riot in the display of it.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he glared at them  he nodded to them  he seemed to have established an understanding with them.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the lights were faint in that part of the court.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the jurors were mere shadows  sitting in rows  the prisoner could see a dozen pair of white eyes shining  coldly  out of the darkness  and whenever the judge in his charge  which was contemptuously brief  nodded and grinned and gibed  the prisoner could see  in the obscurity  by the dip of all these rows of eyes together  that the jury nodded in acquiescence.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and now the charge was over  the huge chief justice leaned back panting and gloating on the prisoner.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,every one in the court turned about  and gazed with steadfast hatred on the man in the dock.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,from the jury box where the twelve sworn brethren were whispering together  a sound in the general stillness like a prolonged    hiss s s    was heard  and then  in answer to the challenge of the officer     how say you  gentlemen of the jury  guilty or not guilty    came in a melancholy voice the finding     guilty.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the place seemed to the eyes of the prisoner to grow gradually darker and darker  till he could discern nothing distinctly but the lumen of the eyes that were turned upon him from every bench and side and corner and gallery of the building.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the prisoner doubtless thought that he had quite enough to say  and conclusive  why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon him  but the lord chief justice puffed it contemptuously away  like so much smoke  and proceeded to pass sentence of death upon the prisoner  having named the   th of the ensuing month for his execution.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,before he had recovered the stun of this ominous farce  in obedience to the mandate     remove the prisoner     he was led from the dock.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the lamps seemed all to have gone out  and there were stoves and charcoal fires here and there  that threw a faint crimson light on the walls of the corridors through which he passed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the stones that composed them looked now enormous  cracked and unhewn.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he came into a vaulted smithy  where two men  naked to the waist  with heads like bulls  round shoulders  and the arms of giants  were welding red hot chains together with hammers that pelted like thunderbolts.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they looked on the prisoner with fierce red eyes  and rested on their hammers for a minute  and said the elder to his companion     take out elijah harbottle   s gyves    and with a pincers he plucked the end which lay dazzling in the fire from the furnace.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,one end locks    said he  taking the cool end of the iron in one hand  while with the grip of a vice he seized the leg of the judge  and locked the ring round his ankle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the other    he said with a grin     is welded.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the iron band that was to form the ring for the other leg lay still red hot upon the stone floor  with brilliant sparks sporting up and down its surface.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his companion in his gigantic hands seized the old judge   s other leg  and pressed his foot immovably to the stone floor  while his senior in a twinkling  with a masterly application of pincers and hammer  sped the glowing bar round his ankle so tight that the skin and sinews smoked and bubbled again  and old judge harbottle uttered a yell that seemed to chill the very stones  and make the iron chains quiver on the wall.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,chains  vaults  smiths  and smithy all vanished in a moment  but the pain continued.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mr. justice harbottle was suffering torture all round the ankle on which the infernal smiths had just been operating.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his friends thavies and beller were startled by the judge   s roar in the midst of their elegant trifling about a marriage    la mode case which was going on.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge was in panic as well as pain.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the street lamps and the light of his own hall door restored him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i   m very bad    growled he between his set teeth     my foot   s blazing.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,who was he that hurt my foot     tis the gout      tis the gout    he said  awaking completely.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,how many hours have we been coming from the playhouse     sblood  what has happened on the way  i   ve slept half the night     there had been no hitch or delay  and they had driven home at a good pace.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge  however  was in gout  he was feverish too  and the attack  though very short  was sharp  and when  in about a fortnight  it subsided  his ferocious joviality did not return.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he could not get this dream  as he chose to call it  out of his head.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,people remarked that the judge was in the vapours.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his doctor said he should go for a fortnight to buxton.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,whenever the judge fell into a brown study  he was always conning over the terms of the sentence pronounced upon him in his vision      in one calendar month from the date of this day    and then the usual form     and you shall be hanged by the neck till you are dead     c.    that will be the   th   i   m not much in the way of being hanged.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i know what stuff dreams are  and i laugh at them  but this is continually in my thoughts  as if it forecast misfortune of some sort.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i wish the day my dream gave me were passed and over.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i wish i were well purged of my gout.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i wish i were as i used to be.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,tis nothing but vapours  nothing but a maggot.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the copy of the parchment and letter which had announced his trial with many a snort and sneer he would read over and over again  and the scenery and people of his dream would rise about him in places the most unlikely  and steal him in a moment from all that surrounded him into a world of shadows.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge had lost his iron energy and banter.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was growing taciturn and morose.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the bar remarked the change  as well they might.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,his friends thought him ill.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the doctor said he was troubled with hypochondria  and that his gout was still lurking in his system  and ordered him to that ancient haunt of crutches and chalk stones  buxton.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge   s spirits were very low  he was frightened about himself  and he described to his housekeeper  having sent for her to his study to drink a dish of tea  his strange dream in his drive home from drury lane playhouse.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was sinking into the state of nervous dejection in which men lose their faith in orthodox advice  and in despair consult quacks  astrologers  and nursery story tellers.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,could such a dream mean that he was to have a fit  and so die on the   th  she did not think so.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,on the contrary  it was certain some good luck must happen on that day.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge kindled  and for the first time for many days  he looked for a minute or two like himself  and he tapped her on the cheek with the hand that was not in flannel.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,odsbud  odsheart  you dear rogue  i had forgot.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there is young tom   yellow tom  my nephew  you know  lies sick at harrogate  why shouldn   t he go that day as well as another  and if he does  i get an estate by it  why  lookee  i asked doctor hedstone yesterday if i was like to take a fit any time  and he laughed  and swore i was the last man in town to go off that way.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge sent most of his servants down to buxton to make his lodgings and all things comfortable for him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was to follow in a day or two.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was now the  th  and the next day well over  he might laugh at his visions and auguries.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,on the evening of the  th  doctor hedstone   s footman knocked at the judge   s door.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the doctor ran up the dusky stairs to the drawing room.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was a march evening  near the hour of sunset  with an east wind whistling sharply through the chimney stacks.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a wood fire blazed cheerily on the hearth.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,and judge harbottle  in what was then called a brigadier wig  with his red roquelaure on  helped the glowing effect of the darkened chamber  which looked red all over like a room on fire.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the judge had his feet on a stool  and his huge grim purple face confronted the fire and seemed to pant and swell  as the blaze alternately spread upward and collapsed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had fallen again among his blue devils  and was thinking of retiring from the bench  and of fifty other gloomy things.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but the doctor  who was an energetic son of   sculapius  would listen to no croaking  told the judge he was full of gout  and in his present condition no judge even of his own case  but promised him leave to pronounce on all those melancholy questions  a fortnight later.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in the meantime the judge must be very careful.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he was over charged with gout  and he must not provoke an attack  till the waters of buxton should do that office for him  in their own salutary way.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the doctor did not think him perhaps quite so well as he pretended  for he told him he wanted rest  and would be better if he went forthwith to his bed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mr. gerningham  his valet  assisted him  and gave him his drops  and the judge told him to wait in his bedroom till he should go to sleep.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,three persons that night had specially odd stories to tell.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the housekeeper had got rid of the trouble of amusing her little girl at this anxious time by giving her leave to run about the sitting rooms and look at the pictures and china  on the usual condition of touching nothing.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was not until the last gleam of sunset had for some time faded  and the twilight had so deepened that she could no longer discern the colours on the china figures on the chimney piece or in the cabinets  that the child returned to the housekeeper   s room to find her mother.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,to her she related  after some prattle about the china  and the pictures  and the judge   s two grand wigs in the dressing room off the library  an adventure of an extraordinary kind.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in the hall was placed  as was customary in those times  the sedan chair which the master of the house occasionally used  covered with stamped leather  and studded with gilt nails  and with its red silk blinds down.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in this case  the doors of this old fashioned conveyance were locked  the windows up  and  as i said  the blinds down  but not so closely that the curious child could not peep underneath one of them  and see into the interior.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a parting beam from the setting sun  admitted through the window of a back room  shot obliquely through the open door  and lighting on the chair  shone with a dull transparency through the crimson blind.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,to her surprise  the child saw in the shadow a thin man dressed in black seated in it  he had sharp dark features  his nose  she fancied  a little awry  and his brown eyes were looking straight before him  his hand was on his thigh  and he stirred no more than the waxen figure she had seen at southwark fair.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a child is so often lectured for asking questions and on the propriety of silence  and the superior wisdom of its elders  that it accepts most things at last in good faith  and the little girl acquiesced respectfully in the occupation of the chair by this mahogany faced person as being all right and proper.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was not until she asked her mother who this man was  and observed her scared face as she questioned her more minutely upon the appearance of the stranger  that she began to understand that she had seen something unaccountable.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mrs. carwell took the key of the chair from its nail over the footman   s shelf  and led the child by the hand up to the hall  having a lighted candle in her other hand.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she stopped at a distance from the chair  and placed the candlestick in the child   s hand.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,peep in  margery  again  and try if there   s anything there    she whispered     hold the candle near the blind so as to throw its light through the curtain.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the child peeped  this time with a very solemn face  and intimated at once that he was gone.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,look again  and be sure    urged her mother.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the little girl was quite certain  and mrs. carwell  with her mob cap of lace and cherry coloured ribbons  and her dark brown hair  not yet powdered  over a very pale face  unlocked the door  looked in  and beheld emptiness.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,all a mistake  child  you see.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there  ma   am  see there  he   s gone round the corner    said the child.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,where    said mrs. carwell  stepping backward a step.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,into that room.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,tut  child     twas the shadow    cried mrs. carwell angrily  because she was frightened.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,i moved the candle.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but she clutched one of the poles of the chair  which leant against the wall in the corner  and pounded the floor furiously with one end of it  being afraid to pass the open door the child had pointed to.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the cook and two kitchen maids came running upstairs  not knowing what to make of this unwonted alarm.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they all searched the room  but it was still and empty  and no sign of any one   s having been there.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,some people may suppose that the direction given to her thoughts by this odd little incident will account for a very strange illusion which mrs. carwell herself experienced about two hours later.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mrs. flora carwell was going up the great staircase with a posset for the judge in a china bowl  on a little silver tray.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,across the top of the well staircase there runs a massive oak rail  and  raising her eyes accidentally  she saw an extremely odd looking stranger  slim and long  leaning carelessly over with a pipe between his finger and thumb.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,nose  lips  and chin seemed all to droop downward into extraordinary length  as he leant his odd peering face over the banister.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in his other hand he held a coil of rope  one end of which escaped from under his elbow and hung over the rail.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mrs. carwell  who had no suspicion at the moment  that he was not a real person  and fancied that he was some one employed in cording the judge   s luggage  called to know what he was doing there.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,instead of answering  he turned about  and walked across the lobby  at about the same leisurely pace at which she was ascending  and entered a room  into which she followed him.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was an uncarpeted and unfurnished chamber.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,an open trunk lay upon the floor empty  and beside it the coil of rope  but except herself there was no one in the room.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,mrs. carwell was very much frightened  and now concluded that the child must have seen the same ghost that had just appeared to her.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,perhaps  when she was able to think it over  it was a relief to believe so  for the face  figure  and dress described by the child were awfully like pyneweck  and this certainly was not he.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,very much scared and very hysterical  mrs. carwell ran down to her room  afraid to look over her shoulder  and got some companions about her  and wept  and talked  and drank more than one cordial  and talked and wept again  and so on  until  in those early days  it was ten o   clock  and time to go to bed.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a scullery maid remained up finishing some of her scouring and    scalding   for some time after the other servants   who  as i said  were few in number   that night had got to their beds.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,this was a low browed  broad faced  intrepid wench with black hair  who did not    vally a ghost not a button    and treated the housekeeper   s hysterics with measureless scorn.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the old house was quiet  now.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,it was near twelve o   clock  no sounds were audible except the muffled wailing of the wintry winds  piping high among the roofs and chimneys  or rumbling at intervals  in under gusts  through the narrow channels of the street.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the spacious solitudes of the kitchen level were awfully dark  and this sceptical kitchen wench was the only person now up and about  in the house.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she hummed tunes to herself  for a time  and then stopped and listened  and then resumed her work again.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,at last  she was destined to be more terrified than even was the housekeeper.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was a back kitchen in this house  and from this she heard  as if coming from below its foundations  a sound like heavy strokes  that seemed to shake the earth beneath her feet.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,sometimes a dozen in sequence  at regular intervals  sometimes fewer.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she walked out softly into the passage  and was surprised to see a dusky glow issuing from this room  as if from a charcoal fire.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the room seemed thick with smoke.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,looking in  she very dimly beheld a monstrous figure  over a furnace  beating with a mighty hammer the rings and rivets of a chain.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the strokes  swift and heavy as they looked  sounded hollow and distant.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the man stopped  and pointed to something on the floor  that  through the smoky haze  looked  she thought  like a dead body.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,she remarked no more  but the servants in the room close by  startled from their sleep by a hideous scream  found her in a swoon on the flags  close to the door  where she had just witnessed this ghastly vision.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,startled by the girl   s incoherent asseverations that she had seen the judge   s corpse on the floor  two servants having first searched the lower part of the house  went rather frightened upstairs to inquire whether their master was well.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,they found him  not in his bed  but in his room.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had a table with candles burning at his bedside  and was getting on his clothes again  and he swore and cursed at them roundly in his old style  telling them that he had business  and that he would discharge on the spot any scoundrel who should dare to disturb him again.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,so the invalid was left to his quietude.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,in the morning it was rumoured here and there in the street that the judge was dead.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a servant was sent from the house three doors away  by counsellor traverse  to inquire at judge harbottle   s hall door.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the servant who opened it was pale and reserved  and would only say that the judge was ill.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,he had had a dangerous accident  doctor hedstone had been with him at seven o   clock in the morning.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there were averted looks  short answers  pale and frowning faces  and all the usual signs that there was a secret that sat heavily upon their minds  and the time for disclosing which had not yet come.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,that time would arrive when the coroner had arrived  and the mortal scandal that had befallen the house could be no longer hidden.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,for that morning mr. justice harbottle had been found hanging by the neck from the banister at the top of the great staircase  and quite dead.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was not the smallest sign of any struggle or resistance.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there had not been heard a cry or any other noise in the slightest degree indicative of violence.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,there was medical evidence to show that  in his atrabilious state  it was quite on the cards that he might have made away with himself.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,the jury found accordingly that it was a case of suicide.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,but to those who were acquainted with the strange story which judge harbottle had related to at least two persons  the fact that the catastrophe occurred on the morning of the   th march seemed a startling coincidence.
Mr. Justice Harbottle,a few days after  the pomp of a great funeral attended him to the grave  and so  in the language of scripture     the rich man died  and was buried.
